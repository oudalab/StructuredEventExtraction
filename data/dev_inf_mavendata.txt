The
naval
Battle
of
Salis
took
place
during
the
Polish–Swedish
War
(
1600–1611
)
during
the
night
of
March
23–24
,
1609
.


After
the
capture
of
Pärnu
,
Jan
Karol
Chodkiewicz
,
commander
of
the
Lithuanian
army
,
moved
towards
Riga
,
which
was
occupied
by
the
Swedes
under
the
command
of
Joachim
Frederick
von
Mansfeld
.


Along
the
way
,
Chodkiewicz
saw
a
chance
to
destroy
the
Swedish
squadron
based
in
the
Salis
port
which
blocked
Riga
.


The
dominant
presence
of
the
Swedes
in
the
Baltic
region
gave
the
Lithuanian
army
the
upper
hand
,
as
von
Mansfeld
and
the
Swedish
army
did
not
expect
the
possibility
of
an
attack
in
such
a
heavily
Swedish-occupied
region
.


Chodkiewicz
's
army
consisted
of
two
ships
obtained
in
Pärnu
,
filled
with
Samogitians
infantry
and
armed
with
cannons
brought
in
from
Pärnu
castle
.


The
squadron
was
additionally
reinforced
by
a
few
hastily
armed
merchant
ships
(
probably
five
)
purchased
from
the
English
and
Dutch
,
and
a
couple
of
boats
and
bateaux
.


To
assist
in
managing
vessel
traffic
,
Chodkiewicz
hired
a
few
sailors
,
mainly
Livonian
.


On
the
night
of
March
23
,
Chodkiewicz
's
army
(
consisting
of
Samogitians
,
Livonians
,
and
probably
some
bribed
members
of
the
Swedish
infantry
)
surprise-attacked
the
Swedish
fleet
.


Using
the
favourable
winds
blowing
inland
,
Chodkiewicz
sent
several
(
probably
four
)
fire
ships
(
their
first
use
in
the
Baltic
in
modern
times
)
into
the
port
,
setting
several
ships
on
fire
and
pushing
them
in
the
direction
of
the
Swedish
warships
anchored
in
formation
.


Unprepared
for
the
attack
,
the
Swedish
attempted
to
save
their
ships
by
cutting
their
anchor
ropes
and
to
flee
.


Despite
this
,
two
Swedish
ships
were
burned
and
soon
sank
.


Retreating
from
the
port
,
the
Swedish
unit
came
under
fire
by
Samogitians
ships
waiting
at
the
roadstead
.


Chodkiewicz
's
Swedish
squadron
did
not
attempt
to
engage
in
an
artillery
fight
and
immediately
escaped
to
the
waters
of
the
Gulf
of
Riga
.


Samogitians
units
,
slower
than
the
Swedish
ships
,
did
not
attempt
to
pursue
them
.


The
entire
Port
of
Salis
,
together
with
stocks
of
weapons
,
ammunition
and
food
,
fell
into
the
hands
of
the
Samogitians
.


The
victory
of
Pärnu
and
Salis
had
a
direct
impact
on
the
further
course
of
the
war
and
contributed
to
halting
the
Swedish
assault
on
Riga
.


The
Battle
of
Sudoměř
was
fought
on
25
March
1420
,
between
Catholic
and
Hussite
forces
.


The
Hussites
were
led
by
Břeněk
of
Švihov
-
who
was
killed
in
battle
-
and
Jan
Žižka
,
whose
forces
proved
victorious
.


This
was
the
second
major
battle
of
the
Hussite
Wars
;
the
first
battle
,
the
Battle
of
Nekmíř
,
was
more
of
a
Hussite
retreat
than
a
true
fight
.


The
Battle
of
Sudoměř
began
after
Hussite
forces
which
had
taken
up
temporary
fortifications
on
the
plains
were
found
by
Royalist
forces
,
who
closed
in
for
an
attack
.


The
Hussites
were
greatly
outnumbered
5
to
1
,
and
initially
hoisted
the
white
flag
,
but
when
the
Royalists
refused
to
accept
their
surrender
the
battle
truly
began
.


though
outnumbered
and
comparatively
ill-equipped
,
facing
heavily
armoured
knights
,
the
hussites
had
fortified
their
surroundings
ingeniously
.


Their
flank
was
protected
by
war
wagons
loaded
with
arquebusiers
,
and
many
large
ponds
and
marshy
areas
surrounded
the
Hussite
infantry
-
ground
which
the
Royalist
Cavalry
could
not
hope
to
cross
.


One
thousand
Knights
Hospitaller
from
Strakonice
led
by
Jindřich
of
Hradec
-
killed
in
battle
-
attacked
war
wagons
placed
on
a
slim
dam
,
with
huge
casualties
but
no
success
.


After
that
,
another
thousand
Royalist
cavalrymen
,
led
by
Peter
von
Konopischt
of
Sternberg
-
killed
in
the
Battle
of
Vítkov
Hill
later
that
year
-
rushed
a
weakly
held
side
of
the
Hussite
formation
,
but
were
mired
in
marshy
ground
.


They
dismounted
in
order
to
progress
,
but
soon
found
themselves
mired
once
more
.


Following
this
,
the
Hussite
light
infantry
equipped
with
flails
were
able
to
easily
finish
the
cavalrymen
.


The
battle
ended
with
the
advance
of
night
and
fog
,
during
which
Žižka
and
the
Hussite
forces
were
able
to
escape
.


though
the
catholic
royalists
were
not
entirely
defeated
,
the
fact
the
hussites
were
able
to
inflict
such
heavy
casualties
with
so
few
men
,
and
then
escape
soundly
proved
to
be
a
great
victory
.


Only
400
hussites
-
farmers
and
townsmen
,
including
women
and
children
-
beat
the
2,000-strong
force
of
heavily
armoured
cavalry
.


Hussite
General
,
Jan
Žižka
,
through
superior
knowledge
of
tactics
and
terrain
,
along
with
the
highly
effective
deployment
of
(
wagon
fort
)
strategies
,
won
the
day
.


Texxas
Jam
was
the
informal
nickname
of
an
annual
summer
rock
concert
called
the
Texxas
World
Music
Festival
(
1978–1988
)
.


It
was
held
in
Dallas
at
the
Cotton
Bowl
,
and
in
Houston
,
at
either
the
Astrodome
or
the
Rice
Stadium
on
the
campus
of
Rice
University
.


The
original
Texxas
Jam
was
a
three-day
festival
held
over
July
4
weekend
in
1978
and
encompassed
rock
and
country
.


Texxas
Jam
was
created
by
Louis
Messina
,
promoter
of
Pace
Concerts
in
Houston
,
and
David
Krebs
,
manager
of
the
rock
acts
Ted
Nugent
and
Aerosmith
.


Krebs
wanted
to
duplicate
the
music
festival
California
Jam
II
(
held
March
18
,
1978
in
Ontario
,
California
)
in
Texas
.


Krebs
was
unfamiliar
with
the
territory
,
so
he
contacted
Messina
in
Houston
.


A
book
,
``
Texxas
Jam
:
1978–1988
,
''
was
published
in
March
2011
covering
all
11
Texxas
Jams
.


Notes
:
Ted
Nugent
joined
Aerosmith
on
stage
for
a
rousing
rendition
of
``

For
comic
relief
,
Cheech

Chong
entertained
the
crowd
between
a
couple
of

reached
104
degrees
that
day
(

surface
with
black
tarps
.


over
100,000
people
were
in
attendance
on
the
hottest

recalls
these
shows
as
being
some
of
the
worst
of
his
career
.


He
claims
to
have
feared
for
his
life
as
his

was
performing
nothing
but
the
rock
opera
``
Killroy

here
''
after
some
of
the
best
hard

The
territorial
era
of
Minnesota
lasted
from
the
Louisiana
Purchase
in
1803
to
Minnesota
's
achieving
statehood
in
1858
.


The
Minnesota
Territory
itself
was
formed
only
in
1849
but
the
area
had
a
rich
history
well
before
this
.


though
there
was
a
long
history
of
european
presence
in
the
area
before
19th
century
,
it
was
during
the
19th
century
that
the
united
states
began
to
establish
a
firm
presence
in
what
would
become
minnesota
.


Many
of
the
facets
of
Minnesota
culture
that
are
perceived
as
the
area
's
``
early
''
history
in
fact
originated
after
this
period
.


Notably
,
the
heavy
Scandinavian
immigration
for
which
the
state
is
known
,
and
the
pioneering
days
chronicled
by
author
Laura
Ingalls
Wilder
occurred
after
statehood
in
the
later
19th
century
.


Unlike
these
later
years
,
the
first
half
of
the
19th
century
was
characterized
by
sparsely
populated
communities
,
harsh
living
conditions
,
and
to
some
degree
,
lawlessness
.


This
era
was
a
period
of
economic
transition
.


The
dominant
enterprise
in
the
area
since
the
17th
century
had
been
the
fur
trade
.


The
Dakota
Sioux
,
and
later
the
Ojibwe
,
tribes
hunted
and
gathered
pelts
trading
with
French
,
British
,
and
later
American
traders
at
Grand
Portage
,
Mendota
,
and
other
sites
.


This
trade
gradually
declined
during
the
early
19th
century
as
demand
for
furs
in
Europe
diminished
.


The
lumber
industry
grew
rapidly
,
replacing
furs
as
the
key
economic
resource
.


Grain
production
began
to
develop
late
during
this
time
as
an
emerging
economic
basis
as
well
.


Saw
mills
,
and
later
grain
mills
,
around
Fort
Snelling
and
Saint
Anthony
Falls
in
east-central
Minnesota
became
magnets
for
development
.


By
the
end
of
the
era
east-central
Minnesota
had
replaced
northern
Minnesota
as
the
economic
center
of
the
area
.


This
era
was
also
as
a
period
of
cultural
transition
.


At
the
time
the
U.S.
took
possession
of
the
region
,
Native
Americans
were
by
far
the
largest
ethnic
groups
.


Their
role
in
the
fur
trade
gave
them
a
steady
stream
of
income
and
significant
political
influence
even
as
the
French
,
British
,
and
Americans
asserted
territorial
claims
on
the
area
.


French
and
British
traders
had
mixed
with
native
society
in
the
area
for
many
decades
peacefully
contributing
to
the
society
and
creating
new
ethnic
groups
consisting
of
mixed-race
peoples
.


As
the
Americans
established
outposts
in
the
area
and
the
fur
trade
declined
,
the
dynamics
changed
dramatically
.


The
economic
influence
of
the
Native
Americans
diminished
and
American
territorial
ideology
increasingly
sought
to
limit
their
influence
.


Large
waves
of
immigration
in
the
1850s
very
suddenly
changed
the
demographics
so
that
within
a
few
years
the
population
shifted
from
predominantly
native
to
predominantly
people
of
European
descent
.


The
native
and
mixed-race
populations
continued
to
influence
the
territory
's
culture
and
politics
,
even
at
the
end
of
the
territorial
era
,
though
by
the
time
statehood
was
achieved
that
influence
was
in
steep
decline
.


Heavy
immigration
from
New
England
and
New
York
led
to
Minnesota
's
being
labeled
the
``
New
England
of
the
West
''
.

was
a
40-year-old
Jamaican
mature
student
living
as
an
illegal
alien
in
London
,
England
.


She
died
following
an
attempt
by
police
officers
to
detain
her
for
deportation
.


During
a
police
raid
on
her
home
in
Crouch
End
,
London
,
she
was
restrained
with
handcuffs
and
leather
straps
and
gagged
with
a
13-foot
length
of
adhesive
``
Elastoplast
''
tape
wrapped
around
her
head
.


Unable
to
breathe
,
she
collapsed
and
suffered
brain
damage
due
to
asphyxia
.


She
was
placed
on
life
support
but
died
following
a
cardiac
arrest
four
days
later
.


In
1995
,
three
of
the
police
officers
involved
stood
trial
for
Gardner
's
manslaughter
,
but
were
acquitted
.


The
case
became
a
cause
célèbre
for
civil
rights
and
justice
campaigners
,
and
for
the
first
time
brought
wide
public
attention
to
what
the
``
Modern
Law
Review
''
called
``
the
inhumanity
of
the
methods
used
routinely
in
the
execution
of
deportation
orders
''
.


Despite
continuing
pressure
by
campaigners
,
no
coroner
's
inquest
or
public
inquiry
into
the
circumstances
of
Gardner
's
death
has
been
held

flight
from

lisbon
,
the
azores
,
guadeloupe
and
peru
to
santiago
,
chile
,
which
crashed
22
june
1962
.


The
Boeing
707–328
aircraft
involved
in
the
accident
was
just
four
months
old
.


The
flight
was
uneventful
until
approaching
Pointe-à-Pitre
.


The
airport
is
surrounded
by
mountains
and
requires
a
steep
descent
.


The
weather
was
poor
–
violent
thunderstorm
and
low
cloud
ceiling
.


The
VOR
navigational
beacon
was
out
of
service
.


The
crew
reported
themselves
over
the
non-directional
beacon
(
NDB
)
at
5,000
feet
(
1,524
m
)
and
turned
east
to
begin
the
final
approach
.


Due
to
incorrect
automatic
direction
finder
(
ADF
)
readings
caused
by
the
thunderstorm
,
the
plane
strayed
15
km
(
9.3
mi
)
west
from
the
procedural
let-down
track
.


The
plane
crashed
in
a
forest
on
a
hill
called
``
Dos
D'Ane
''
(
``
The
Donkey
's
Back
''
)
,
at
about
1,400
feet
(
427
m
)
and
exploded
.


There
were
no
survivors
.


Among
the
dead
was
French
Guianan
politician
and
war
hero
Justin
Catayée
and
poet
and
black-consciousness
activist
Paul
Niger
.


The
investigation
could
not
determine
the
exact
reason
for
the
accident
,
but
suspected
the
insufficient
meteorological
information
given
to
the
crew
,
failure
of
the
ground
equipment
,
and
the
atmospheric
effects
on
the
ADF
indicator
.


After
the
crash
Air
France
pilots
criticized
under-developed
airports
with
facilities
that
were
ill-equipped
to
handle
jet
aircraft
,
such
as
Guadeloupe
's
airport
.


This
was
the
second
accident
in
less
than
three
weeks
with
an
Air
France
Boeing
707
after
the
crash
on
3
June
1962

...
After
much
extra
,
and
in

,
excessive
flight
training
,
the
chief

failed
to

he

Aeroflot
Flight
821
was
a
scheduled
passenger
flight
operated
by
Aeroflot-Nord
in
a
service
agreement
with
Aeroflot
and
as
its
subsidiary
.


On
14
September
2008
,
the
aircraft
operating
the
flight
crashed
on
approach
to
Perm
International
Airport
at
5:10
local
time
(
UTC+06
)
.


All
82
passengers
and
6
crew
members
were
killed
.


Among
the
passengers
who
were
killed
was
Russian
Colonel
General
Gennady
Troshev
formerly
the
commander
of
the
North
Caucasus
Military
District
(
including
Chechnya
)
during
the
Second
Chechen
War
and
adviser
to
the
President
of
Russia
.


A
section
of
the
Trans-Siberian
Railway
was
damaged
by
the
crash
.


Flight
821
is
the
deadliest
accident
involving
a
Boeing
737-500
,
surpassing
the
1993
crash
of
Asiana
Airlines
Flight
733
,
and
was
the
second-deadliest
aviation
incident
in
2008
,
behind
Spanair
Flight
5022
.


The
primary
cause
of
the
crash
was
that
both
pilots
had
lost
spatial
orientation
due
to
their
inexperience
with
the
Western
type
of
attitude
indicator
on
the
aircraft
.


Lack
of
adequate
rest
,
poor
crew
resource
management
,
and
alcohol
consumption
by
the
captain
also
contributed
to
the
accident
.


This
air
disaster
led
to
Aeroflot-Nord
rebranding
as
Nordavia
,
effective
on
1
December
2009
and
later
to
Smartavia
in
2019

The
West
Virginia
coal
wars
(
1912–21
)
,
also
known
as
the
mine
wars
,
arose
out
of
a
dispute
between
coal
companies
and
miners
.


The
first
workers
strike
,
in
West
Virginia
,
was
the
Cabin
Creek
and
Paint
Creek
strike
of
1912-1913
.


With
help
from
Mary
``
Mother
Jones
''
Harris
Jones
,
an
important
figure
in
unionizing
the
mine
workers
,
the
miners
demanded
better
pay
,
better
work
conditions
,
the
right
to
trade
where
they
pleased
(
ending
the
practice
of
forcing
miners
to
buy
from
company-owned
stores
)
,
and
recognition
of
the
United
Mine
Workers
(
UMW
)
.


The
mining
companies
refused
to
meet
the
demands
of
the
workers
and
instead
hired
Baldwin-Felts
agents
equipped
with
high-powered
rifles
to
guard
the
mines
and
act
as
strikebreakers
.


After
the
Agents
arrived
,
the
miners
either
moved
out
or
were
evicted
from
the
houses
they
had
been
renting
from
the
coal
companies
,
and
moved
into
coal
camps
that
were
being
supported
by
the
Union
.


Approximately
35,000
people
lived
in
these
coal
camps
.


A
month
after
the
strike
began
,
hostilities
began
with
the
arrival
of
the
Baldwin-Felts
Agents
who
provoked
the
miners
.


socialist
party
activists
began
supplying
miners
with
weapons
:
6
machine
guns
,
1,000
high-powered
rifles
,
and
50,000
rounds
of
ammunition
.


On
September
1
,
1912
,
approximately
6,000
unionized
miners
from
across
the
Kanawha
River
crossed
the
river
and
declared
their
intent
to
kill
the
mine
guards
and
destroy
the
company
operations
.


Due
to
this
threat
,
the
mining
companies
deployed
additional
armed
guards
and
awaited
the
miners
'
attack
.


Consequently
,
the
Governor
proclaimed
martial
law
to
be
in
effect
on
September
2
,
1912
,
seizing
1,872
high-powered
rifles
,
556
pistols
,
6
machine
guns
,
225,000
rounds
of
ammunition
,
and
480

as
well
as
large
quantities
of
daggers
,
bayonets
,
and

.


On

1920
,
a
shootout
in
Matewan
,
West
Virginia
,
between
agents
of
the
Baldwin-Felts
and
local
miners
,
who
later
joined
the
United
Mine
Workers
of
America
,
sparked
what
became
known
as
the
Battle
of
Blair
Mountain
,
the
largest
insurrection
in
the
United
States
since
the
American
Civil
War
.


The
Nine
Years
'
War
(
1688–1697
)
,
often
called
the
War
of
the
Grand
Alliance
or
the
War
of
the
League
of
Augsburg
,
was
a
conflict
between
Louis
XIV
of
France
and
a
European
coalition
of
the
Holy
Roman
Empire
(
led
by
Austria
)
,
the
Dutch
Republic
,
Spain
,
England
and
Savoy
.


It
was
fought
in
Europe
and
the
surrounding
seas
,
North
America
and
in
India
.


It
is
sometimes
considered
the
first
global
war
.


The
conflict
encompassed
the
Williamite
war
in
Ireland
and
Jacobite
risings
in
Scotland
,
where
William
III
and
James
II
struggled
for
control
of
England
and
Ireland
,
and
a
campaign
in
colonial
North
America
between
French
and
English
settlers
and
their
respective
Indigenous
allies
,
today
called
King
William
's
War
by
Americans
.


Louis
XIV
of
France
had
emerged
from
the
Franco-Dutch
War
in
1678
as
the
most
powerful
monarch
in
Europe
,
an
absolute
ruler
who
had
won
numerous
military
victories
.


Using
a
combination
of
aggression
,
annexation
,
and
quasi-legal
means
,
Louis
XIV
set
about
extending
his
gains
to
stabilize
and
strengthen
France
's
frontiers
,
culminating
in
the
brief
War
of
the
Reunions
(
1683–1684
)
.


The
Truce
of
Ratisbon
guaranteed
France
's
new
borders
for
twenty
years
,
but
Louis
XIV
's
subsequent
actions—notably
his
Edict
of
Fontainebleau
(
the
revocation
of
the
Edict
of
Nantes
)
in
1685—led
to
the
deterioration
of
his
military
and
political
dominance
.


Louis
XIV
's
decision
to
cross
the
Rhine
in
September
1688
was
designed
to
extend
his
influence
and
pressure
the
Holy
Roman
Empire
into
accepting
his
territorial
and
dynastic
claims
.


Leopold
I
and
the
German
princes
resolved
to
resist
,
and
when
the
States
General
and
William
III
brought
the
Dutch
and
the
English
into
the
war
against
France
,
the
French
king
faced
a
powerful
coalition
aimed
at
curtailing
his
ambitions
.


The
main
fighting
took
place
around
France
's
borders
in
the
Spanish
Netherlands
,
the
Rhineland
,
the
Duchy
of
Savoy
and
Catalonia
.


The
fighting
generally
favoured
Louis
XIV
's
armies
,
but
by
1696
his
country
was
in
the
grip
of
an
economic
crisis
.


The
Maritime
Powers
(
England
and
the
Dutch
Republic
)
were
also
financially
exhausted
,
and
when
Savoy
defected
from
the
Alliance
,
all
parties
were
keen
to
negotiate
a
settlement
.


by
the
terms
of
the
treaty
of
ryswick
(
1697
)
louis
xiv
retained
the
whole
of
alsace
but
was
forced
to
return
lorraine
to
its
ruler
and
give
up
any
gains
on
the
right
bank
of
the
rhine
.


Louis
XIV
also
accepted
William
III
as
the
rightful
King
of
England
,
while
the
Dutch
acquired
a
Barrier
fortress
system
in
the
Spanish
Netherlands
to
help
secure
their
borders
.


With
the
ailing
and
childless
Charles
II
of
Spain
approaching
his
end
,
a
new
conflict
over
the
inheritance
of
the
Spanish
Empire
embroiled
Louis
XIV
and
the
Grand
Alliance
in
the
War
of
the
Spanish
Succession
.


On
3
April
1996
,
Liverpool
faced
Newcastle
United
in
a
Premier
League
fixture
at
Anfield
,
during
the
1995–96
season
.


Liverpool
won
the
match
,
scoring
four
goals
to
Newcastle
's
three
.


The
winning
goal
was
scored
by
striker
Stan
Collymore
in
the
second
minute
of
stoppage
time
.


Before
the
match
,
both
clubs
had
lost
their
previous
fixtures
but
still
had
a
chance
of
winning
the
league
and
wanted
to
close
the
gap
between
themselves
and
leaders
Manchester
United
.


Newcastle
United
,
who
had
been
10
points
ahead
at
Christmas
,
had
suffered
a
decline
during
the
previous
two
months
,
winning
one
match
out
of
four
in
March
1996
,
and
surrendering
their
lead
of
the
league
to
Manchester
United
after
spending
virtually
all
of
the
season
top
of
the
table
.


Liverpool
had
won
six
of
their
last
nine
league
games
during
February
and
March
,
scored
the
most
goals
and
conceded
the
fewest
until
this
match
.


Liverpool
started
the
match
as
the
more
promising
team
and
striker
Robbie
Fowler
scored
the
first
goal
.


Newcastle
striker
Les
Ferdinand
scored
the
equaliser
in
the
tenth
minute
and
winger
David
Ginola
added
a
second
for
Newcastle
four
minutes
later
.


Fowler
scored
early
in
the
second
half
to
equalise
but
Faustino
Asprilla
restored
their
goal
advantage
in
the
57th
minute
.


Stan
Collymore
,
who
set
up
the
opening
goal
for
Liverpool
,
equalised
for
Liverpool
in
the
68th
minute
.


In
stoppage
time
,
Collymore
scored
his
second
goal
of
the
match
involving
a
one-two
with
Ian
Rush
and
John
Barnes
in
the
buildup
.


The
winner
sparked
jubilant
scenes
for
Liverpool
supporters
at
Anfield
and
consigned
Newcastle
to
their
second
consecutive
defeat
in
the
league
,
reducing
their
chances
of
winning
the
league
,
although
ultimately
Manchester
United
were
not
confirmed
as
champions
until
the
final
game
of
the
season
.


The
match
is
considered
to
be
among
the
best
Premier
League
games
in
the
history
of
the
competition
.


Newcastle
's
manager
Kevin
Keegan
described
it
as
a
``
classic
''
,
while
Liverpool
manager
Roy
Evans
said
``
the
entertainment
value
was
up
there
with
the
best
''
.


In
2003
,
the
game
was
awarded
the
Match
of
the
Decade
award
on
behalf
of
the
Premier
League
,
which
was
celebrating
its
tenth
anniversary
.


The
result
played
a
major
factor
in
the
outcome
the
league
title
race
,
as
Manchester
United
lost
only
one
more
match
that
season
and
regained
the
title
from
Blackburn
Rovers
.


The
German
Peasants
'
War
,
Great
Peasants
'
War
or
Great
Peasants
'
Revolt
(
)
was
a
widespread
popular
revolt
in
some
German-speaking
areas
in
Central
Europe
from
1524
to
1525
.


It
failed
because
of
the
intense
opposition
by
the
aristocracy
,
who
slaughtered
up
to
100,000
of
the
300,000
poorly
armed
peasants
and
farmers
.


The
survivors
were
fined
and
achieved
few
,
if
any
,
of
their
goals
.


The
war
consisted
,
like
the
preceding
Bundschuh
movement
and
the
Hussite
Wars
,
of
a
series
of
both
economic
and
religious
revolts
in
which
peasants
and
farmers
,
often
supported
by
Anabaptist
clergy
,
took
the
lead
.


the
german
peasants
'
war
was
europe
's
largest
and
most
widespread
popular
uprising
prior
to
the
french
revolution
of
1789
.


The
fighting
was
at
its
height
in
the
middle
of
1525
.


The
war
began
with
separate
insurrections
,
beginning
in
the
southwestern
part
of
what
is
now
Germany
and
Alsace
,
and
spread
in
subsequent
insurrections
to
the
central
and
eastern
areas
of
Germany
and
present-day
Austria
.


After
the
uprising
in
Germany
was
suppressed
,
it
flared
briefly
in
several
Swiss
Cantons
.


In
mounting
their
insurrection
,
peasants
faced
insurmountable
obstacles
.


The
democratic
nature
of
their
movement
left
them
without
a
command
structure
and
they
lacked
artillery
and
cavalry
.


Most
of
them
had
little
,
if
any
,
military
experience
.


In
combat
they
often
turned
and
fled
,
and
were
massacred
by
their
pursuers
.


The
opposition
had
experienced
military
leaders
,
well-equipped
and
disciplined
armies
,
and
ample
funding
.


The
revolt
incorporated
some
principles
and
rhetoric
from
the
emerging
Protestant
Reformation
,
through
which
the
peasants
sought
influence
and
freedom
.


Radical
Reformers
and
Anabaptists
,
most
famously
Thomas
Müntzer
,
instigated
and
supported
the
revolt
.


In
contrast
,
Martin
Luther
and
other
Magisterial
Reformers
condemned
it
and
clearly
sided
with
the
nobles
.

the
violence
as

's
work
and
called
for
the

to
put
down
the

Historians
have
interpreted
the
economic
aspects
of

The
2008
IIHF
World
Championship
was
played
between
May
2
and
May
18
,
2008
in
the
Canadian
cities
of
Halifax
(
Nova
Scotia
)
and
Quebec
City
(
Quebec
)
.


The
two
venues
were
the
Halifax
Metro
Centre
and
the
Colisée
Pepsi
.


The
tournament
was
won
by
Russia
which
claimed
its
first
gold
medal
since
1993
.


It
was
the
72nd
IIHF
World
Championship
event
,
and
was
run
by
the
International
Ice
Hockey
Federation
(
IIHF
)
.


It
was
the
first
time
the
final
tournament
is
held
in
a
non-European
country
since
1962
,
when
it
was
held
in
Colorado
,
USA
.


The
IIHF
wanted
to
celebrate
the
federation
's
100th
anniversary
by
holding
the
tournament
in
the
country
where
ice
hockey
was
born
.


The
tournament
was
also
included
as
part
of
the
celebrations
of
Quebec
City
's
400th
anniversary
.


The
tournament
featured
many
countries
'
elite
stars
,
as
it
served
as
the
last
and
most
important
stage
in
selecting
nine
automatic
qualifiers
for
the
men
's
hockey
competition
at
the
2010
Winter
Olympics
in
Vancouver
,
British
Columbia
,
Canada
,
a
process
that
uses
the
IIHF
World
Ranking
standings
after
the
tournament
.


On
May
8
,
2007
,
the
IIHF
announced
it
``
will
also
formalize
the
Triple
Gold
Club
by
awarding
commemorative
medals
to
the
19
players
who
have
won
the
three
most
prestigious
championships
in

,
and
World

gold
.


The
ceremony
will
take
place
in
Canada
during
the
2008
World
Championship
.
''


There
were
two
changes
in
the
format
compared
to
earlier
years
.


Because
of
the
distance
between
Halifax
and
Quebec
City
,
the
quarter-finals
were
played
within
the
group
,
instead
of
crossing
over
which
has
happened
since
2000
.


The
relegation
round
was
different
too
,
as
it
consisted
of
two
best-of-three
series
instead
of
a
round
robin
series
between
four
teams
.


For
the
first
time
in
40
years
,
the
matches
were
played
on
smaller
,
NHL
size
rinks
,
200
ft
×
85
ft
(
roughly
61
m
×
26
m
)
,
compared
to
the
IIHF
standard
which
is
roughly
200

×
98.5

(

Argentina
’
s
former
President
and
1st
Secretary
General
of
the
Union
of
South
American
Nations
,
Néstor
Kirchner
,
died
of
heart
failure
on
the
morning
of
27
October
2010
at
the
Jose
Formenti
hospital
in
El
Calafate
,
Santa
Cruz
Province
at
the
age
of
60
.


Efforts
to
revive
him
were
unsuccessful
.


His
wife
,
President
Cristina
Fernández
de
Kirchner
,
was
present
with
him
when
he
died
.


He
was
also
expected
to
run
for
president
in
2011
.


He
had
two
coronary
interventions
earlier
that
year
.


On
7
February
2010
,
he
developed
problems
with
the
common
carotid
artery
and
needed
surgery
.


On
11
September
2010
,
he
was
hospitalized
due
to
coronary
artery
blockage
and
needed
an
angioplasty
.


For
more
than
24
hours
,
hundreds
of
thousands
of
people
filed
past
Kirchner
’
s
body
lying
in
state
,
in
a
state
funeral
at
the
Casa
Rosada
attended
by
several
Argentine
personalities
and
eight
South
American
leaders
.


Starting
29
October
afternoon
,
a
massive
popular
procession
accompanied
the
remains
of
Néstor
Kirchner
from
Casa
Rosada
to
the
metropolitan
airport
,
and
then
from
the
airport
of
Río

The
Franco-Dutch
War
,
often
just
the
Dutch
War
(
;
)
,
was
a
conflict
that
lasted
from
1672
to
1678
between
the
Dutch
Republic
and
France
,
each
supported
by
allies
.


France
had
the
support
of
England
and
Sweden
,
while
the
Dutch
were
supported
by
Spain
,
the
Holy
Roman
Empire
and
Denmark
.


The
war
began
in
May
1672
when
France
invaded
the
Netherlands
and
nearly
overran
it
,
an
event
still
referred
to
as
``
het
Rampjaar
''
or
'Disaster
Year
'
.


by
late
july
,
the
dutch
position
had
stabilised
,
with
support
from
emperor
leopold
,
brandenburg-prussia
and
spain
;
this
was
formalised
in
the
august
1673
treaty
of
the
hague
,
joined
by
denmark
in
january
1674
.


Faced
by
a
financial
crisis
,
Sweden
agreed
to
remain
neutral
in
return
for
French
subsidies
,
but
became
involved
in
the
1675–1679
Scanian
War
with
its
regional
rivals
Denmark
and
Brandenburg
.


On
balance
,
the
cost
of
funding
the
Swedish
army
made
its
support
largely
negative
for
France
.


the
period
of
english
participation
as
an
ally
of
france
is
also
known
as
the
third
anglo-dutch
war
;
the
alliance
was
always
unpopular
and
domestic
opposition
led
to
its
exit
in
the
february
1674
treaty
of
westminster
.


In
November
1677
,
William
of
Orange
married
his
cousin
Mary
,
niece
to
Charles
II
of
England
and
England
agreed
a
defensive
alliance
with
the
Dutch
in
March
1678
.


Under
the
Peace
of
Nijmegen
,
France
returned
Charleroi
to
Spain
.


In
return
,
it
received
the
Franche-Comté
and
cities
in
Flanders
and
Hainaut
,
essentially
establishing
modern
France
's
northern
border
.


However
,
it
also
marked
the
highpoint
of
French
expansion
under
Louis
and
William
's
arrival
as
leader
of
an
anti-French
coalition
,
which
would
hold
together
in
the
1688–1697
Nine
Years
War
and
1701–1714
War
of
the
Spanish
Succession
.


the
air
battle
over
unk
was
an
air-to-air
engagement
between
czechoslovak
and
usafe
air
units
over
the
czech
village
of
unk
,
in
the
bohemian
forest
,
on
10
march
1953
.


During
the
action
Czech
pilot
Jaroslav
Šrámek
,
flying
a
MiG-15
,
shot
down
one
of
a
pair
of
American
F-84E
Thunderjets
(
from
53rd
Fighter
Bomber
Squadron
,
36th
Fighter-Bomber
Wing
)
.


The
American
pilot
,
Lt.
Warren
G.Brown
ejected
from
the
aircraft
,
which
crash-landed
in
German
territory
,
approximately
35
kilometres
(
22
mi
)
from
the
border
,
and
survived
.


It
was
reported
in
the
London
Times
that
the
attack
on
the
American
aircraft
was
ten
miles
from
the
border
near
the
town
of
Falkenstein
,
Bavaria
.


The
aircraft
crashed
near
Regensburg
,
Bavaria
and
the
burnt
out
wreckage
of
the
F-84
was
recovered
by
American
soldiers
.


The
attack
followed
reports
of
other
Czechoslovak
aircraft
over
Bavarian
territory
.


Brown
,
the
pilot
of
the
F-84
,
reported
they
were
on
a
routine
patrol
along
the
border
when
they
spotted
two
aircraft
appear
from
the
East
,
he
was
fired
upon
and
bailed
out
after
losing
control
.


In
2015
,
U.S.
federal
prosecutors
disclosed
cases
of
corruption
by
officials
and
associates
connected
with
the
Fédération
Internationale
de
Football
Association
(
FIFA
)
,
the
governing
body
of
association
football
,
futsal
and
beach
soccer
.


near
the
end
of
may
2015
,
fourteen
people
were
indicted
in
connection
with
an
investigation
by
the
united
states
federal
bureau
of
investigation
(
fbi
)
and
the
internal
revenue
service
criminal
investigation
division
(
unk
)
into
wire
fraud
,
racketeering
,
and
money
laundering
.


The
United
States
Attorney
General
simultaneously
announced
the
unsealing
of
the
indictments
and
the
prior
guilty
pleas
by
four
football
executives
and
two
corporations
.


The
investigation
mostly
revolved
around
collusion
between
officials
of
continental
football
bodies
CONMEBOL
(
South
America
)
and
CONCACAF
(
Caribbean
,
Central
and
North
America
)
,
and
sports
marketing
executives
.


The
sports
marketing
executives
were
holders
of
media
and
marketing
rights
for
high-profile
international
competitions
including
the
Americas
'
FIFA
World
Cup
qualifying
tournaments
,
and
showpiece
tournaments
CONCACAF
Gold
Cup
and
Copa
América
.


CONCACAF
President
Jeffrey
Webb
,
also
serving
president
of
the
Cayman
Islands
Football
Association
,
was
arrested
in
connection
with
the
investigation
,
as
were
two
sitting
FIFA
Executive
Committee
members
:
Eduardo
Li
of
the
Costa
Rican
Football
Federation
and
Eugenio
Figueredo
,
formerly
of
the
Uruguayan
Football
Association
,
and
former
CONMEBOL
President
Nicolás
Leoz
.


The
investigation
lasted
several
years
,
with
the
first
arrest
,
of
former
CONCACAF
president
Jack
Warner
's
son
Daryll
,
made
in
July
2013
.


In
total
,
seven
current
FIFA
officials
were
arrested
at
the
Hotel
Baur
au
Lac
in
Zürich
on
27
May
.


They
were
preparing
to
attend
the
65th
FIFA
Congress
,
which
was
scheduled
to
include
the
election
of
the
president
of
FIFA
.


They
are
expected
to
be
extradited
to
the
United
States
on
suspicion
of
receiving
in
bribes
.


There
was
also
a
simultaneous
raid
on
the
CONCACAF
headquarters
in
Miami
,
and
later
,
two
further
men
handed
themselves
in
to
police
for
arrest
:
Jack
Warner
and
marketing
executive
Alejandro
Burzaco
.


Two
further
arrests
of
FIFA
officials
at
the
hotel
occurred
in
December
2015
.


The
arrests
case
triggered
Australia
,
Colombia
,
Costa
Rica
,
Germany
and
Switzerland
to
open
or
intensify
separate
criminal
investigations
into
top
FIFA
officials
for
corruption
.


On
Thursday
21
July
2005
,
four
attempted
bomb
attacks
disrupted
part
of
London
's
public
transport
system
two
weeks
after
the
7
July
2005
London
bombings
.


The
explosions
occurred
around
midday
at
Shepherd
's
Bush
,
Warren
Street
and
Oval
stations
on
the
London
Underground
,
and
on
London
Buses
route
26
in
Bethnal
Green
on
Hackney
Road
.


A
fifth
bomber
dumped
his
device
without
attempting
to
set
it
off
.


Connecting
lines
and
stations
were
closed
and
evacuated
.


Metropolitan
Police
later
said
the
intention
was
to
cause
large-scale
loss
of
life
,
but
only
the
detonators
of
the
bombs
exploded
,
probably
causing
the
popping
sounds
reported
by
witnesses
,
and
only
one
minor
injury
was
reported
.


The
suspects
fled
the
scenes
after
their
bombs
failed
to
explode
.


On
Friday
22
July
,
CCTV
images
of
four
suspects
wanted
in
connection
with
the
bombings
were
released
.


Two
of
the
men
shown
in
these
images
were
identified
by
police
on
Monday
25
July
as
Muktar
Said
Ibrahim
and
Yasin
Hassan
Omar
.


The
resultant
manhunt
was
described
by
the
Metropolitan
police
commissioner
Sir
Ian
Blair
as
``
the
greatest
operational
challenge
ever
faced
''
by
the
Met
.


During
the
manhunt
,
police
misidentified
Jean
Charles
de
Menezes
as
one
of
the
suspected
bombers
and
shot
and
killed
him
.


By
29
July
,
police
had
arrested
all
four
of
the
main
bombing
suspects
from
21
July
attempted
bombings
.


Yasin
Hassan
Omar
was
arrested
by
police
on
27
July
,
in
Birmingham
.


On
29
July
,
two
more
suspects
were
arrested
in
London
.


A
fourth
suspect
,
Osman
Hussein
,
was
arrested
in
Rome
,
Italy
,
and
later
extradited
to
the
UK
.


Police
also
arrested
numerous
other
people
in
the
course
of
their
investigations
.


On
9

2007
,
four
defendants

The
four
attempted
bombers
were
each
sentenced
to
life
imprisonment
,
with
a
minimum
of
40
years
'
imprisonment
.


In
each
case
,
only
the
detonator
caps
fired
and
the
bombs
themselves
did
not
go
off
;
this
may
have
been
due
to
the
low
quality
hydrogen
peroxide
used
in
the
devices
,
which
had
been
obtained
from
a
large
number
of
easily
available
sources
.


The
explosions
were
small—only
about
as
powerful
as
a
large
firework—and
no
injuries
were
reported
,
although
a
person
who
suffered
an
asthma
attack
was
counted
as
the
incident
's
sole
injury
.


Severe
Tropical
Cyclone
Winifred
was
the
worst
tropical
cyclone
to
make
landfall
in
northern
Queensland
since
Cyclone
Amy
in
1971
and
the
first
since
Althea
to
inflict
significant
damage
on
the
northeastern
coast
of
Australia
.


The
sixth
named
storm
of
the
1985–86
Australian
region
cyclone
season
,
Winifred
originated
as
a
tropical
low
north
of
Cairns
,
Queensland
on
27
January
1986
.


Slowly
organizing
,
the
system
was
recognized
as
a
tropical
cyclone
after
gaining
tropical
characteristics
on
30
January
,
christened
with
the
name
Winifred
the
same
day
.


Meandering
southward
,
the
cyclone
began
to
curve
southeastward
that
evening
before
suddenly
turning
toward
the
coast
,
southwestward
,
on
31
January
,
steadily
intensifying
in
that
time
.


By
the
time
it
came
ashore
near
Silkwood
,
Queensland
at
0445
UTC
on
1
February
,
it
was
producing
Category
3-force
winds
on
the
Australian
tropical
cyclone
intensity
scale
and
a
minimum
atmospheric
pressure
of
957
mbar
(
28.38
inHg
)
.


Weakening
as
it
drifted
inland
,
Winifred
persisted
as
a
tropical
depression
for
another
five
days
after
landfall
before
finally
dissipating
on
5
February
.


In
advance
of
Winifred
's
approach
,
the
Australian
Bureau
of
Meteorology
(
BoM
)
issued
cyclone
watches
and
warnings
for
various
locations
along
the
Queensland
coast
,
prompting
evacuations
in
several
towns
.


Damage
after
landfall
was
widespread
and
severe
,
with
thousands
of
homes
damaged
,
flooding
as
a
result
of
heavy
rainfall
along
major
rivers
,
and
severe
damage
to
crops
.


Debris
obstructed
roads
across
northern
Queensland
and
power
outages
disrupted
electrical
service
,
even
at
water
treatment
plants
,
forcing
officials
to
warn
residents
to
boil
water
as
a
precautionary
measure
.


Overall
,
the
cyclone
caused
$
86.4
million
in
agriculture-related
damages
,
with
sugar
cane
and
banana
harvests
suffering
the
most
.


Tourist
operations
were
generally
uninterrupted
by
the
storm
,
while
ecological
and
environmental
damage
,
if
any
,
was
mild
.


Even
so
,
high
winds
uprooted
trees
in
wide
swaths
of
forests
,
with
those
not
completely
defoliated
.


Overall
,
Winifred
caused
three
deaths
and
inflicted
$
130
million
(
1986
AUD
;
$
154
million
USD
)
in
damage
.


In
the
aftermath
of
the
cyclone
,
the
Australian
government
distributed
financial
and
emergency
aid
,
offering
to
provide
assistance
to
hard-hit
banana
and
sugar
cane
farmers
in
northern
Queensland
.


hundreds
of
state
emergency
service
(
ses
)
volunteers
were
deployed
to
restore
electrical
and
water
services
,
evacuate
local
citizens
,
provide
food
,
and
repair
and
protect
structures
.


The
Department
of
Social
Security
(
DSS
)
sent
employees
to
receive
claims
for
damage
,
requests
for
financial
aid
,
and
filings
for
unemployment
benefits
.


Meanwhile
,
the
Commonwealth
of
Australia
initiated
a
three-year
,
$
150
million
program
to
provide
relief
to
damaged
areas
.


Fund
payments
,
however
,
were
frequently
incorrectly
distributed
,
and
in
some
cases
,
fraudulent
.


In
the
confusion
in
the
days
following
the
cyclone
,
looters
stole
possessions
in
areas
within
the
vicinity
of
Innisfail
,
and
relief
efforts
were
impeded
by
thunderstorms
at
Cairns
.


The
Bureau
of
Meteorology
(
BoM

was
subject
to
heavy
criticism
in
the
days
following
the
storm
's
landfall
,
accused
of
not
giving
ample
warning
in
advance
of
Winifred
's
approach
;
however
,
these
concerns
were
later
addressed
in
its
report
on
the
cyclone
's
impact
.


Due
to
the
severity
of
the
storm
's
damage
,
the
name
``
Winifred
''
was
retired
after
the
season
ended
.


The
2013
New
South
Wales
bushfires
were
a
series
of
bushfires
in
Australia
across
the
state
of
New
South
Wales
primarily
starting
,
or
becoming
notable
,
on
13
October
2013
;
followed
by
the
worst
of
the
fires
beginning
in
the
Greater
Blue
Mountains
Area
on
16
and
17
October
2013
.


High
fuel
loads
,
coupled
with
warm
,
dry
and
windy
weather
,
provided
dangerous
conditions
which
fuelled
the
fires
.


at
the
peak
of
the
fires
,
on
the
morning
of
18
october
,
over
100
fires
were
burning
across
the
state
.


The
Premier
of
New
South
Wales
Barry
O'Farrell
declared
a
state
of
emergency
on
20
October
,
empowering
firefighters
to
evict
residents
and
demolish
fire-affected
buildings
.


The
fires
are
the
worst
in
New
South
Wales
since
the
1960s
.


,
248
houses
and
other
structures
were
destroyed
across
the
state
.


Two
fatalities
were
attributed
to
the
fires
.


It
was
estimated
that
claims
will
exceed
94
million
.


The
Philippines
was
under
a
state
of
emergency
,
announced
by
presidential
spokesperson
Ignacio
Bunye
on
the
morning
of
February
24
,
2006
,
by
the
virtue
of
Proclamation
No
.


1017
.


This
occurred
after
the
government
claimed
that
it
foiled
an
alleged
coup
d'état
attempt
against
the
rule
of
President
Gloria
Macapagal-Arroyo
earlier
that
same
day
.


State
security
services
also
claimed
that
it
had
arrested
a
general
who
was
involved
in
the
coup
attempt
.


President
Arroyo
lifted
the
state
of
emergency
on
March
3
,
2006
by
the
virtue
of
Proclamation
No
.


1021
.


The
state
of
national
emergency
also
led
to
a
temporary
suspension
of
lower-level
education
classes
and
an
immediate
revocation
on
all
licenses
and
permits
to
hold
demonstrations
and
protests
.


The
government
,
informally
known
as
``
Malacañang
''
,
after
the
presidential
palace
,
also
suspended
all
public
activities
on
the
same
day
and
even
on
succeeding
days
.


Under
the
provisions
of
the
1987
Constitution
,
the
government
was
allowed
at
the
moment
to
detain
anyone
indefinitely
without
the
privilege
of
the
writ
of
habeas
corpus
.


President
Arroyo
assured
Filipinos
that
the
situation
was
under
control
and
the
state
of
emergency
would
not
be
abused
.


Arroyo
had
justified
the
declaration
of
a
state
of
emergency
with
her
statement
of
``
clear
and
present
danger
to
our
Republic
that
we
have
discovered
and
thwarted
.
''


Critics
claimed
that
this
was
an
attempt
by
Arroyo
to
seize
political
power
due
to
her
sagging
influence
and
popularity
,
and
some
drew
similarities
to
the
actions
of
her
predecessor
,
Ferdinand
Marcos
,
when
he
declared
martial
law
in
1972
.


On
March
3
,
2006
(
one
week
after
the
proclamation
)
,
by
the
virtue
of
Proclamation
No
.


1021
,
the
President
lifted
the
state
of
emergency
.


The
defense
of
Sihang
Warehouse
took
place
from
October
26
to
November
1
,
1937
,
and
marked
the
beginning
of
the
end
of
the
three-month
Battle
of
Shanghai
in
the
opening
phase
of
the
Second
Sino-Japanese
War
.


Defenders
of
the
warehouse
held
out
against
numerous
waves
of
Japanese
forces
and
covered
Chinese
forces
retreating
west
during
the
Battle
of
Shanghai
.


The
successful
defense
of
the
warehouse
provided
a
morale-lifting
consolation
to
the
Chinese
army
and
people
in
the
demoralizing
aftermath
of
the
Japanese
invasion
of
Shanghai
.


The
warehouse
's
location
just
across
the
Suzhou
Creek
from
the
foreign
concessions
in
Shanghai
meant
the
battle
took
place
in
full
view
of
the
western
powers
.


It
was
across
from
the
foreign
concessions
in
Shanghai
,
and
the
Japanese
did
not
dare
to
call
naval
artillery
strikes
on
the
area
,
since
a
stray
shot
might
land
in
the
concessions
and
provoke
an
incident
with
the
Europeans
and
Americans
,
whom
the
Japanese
wanted
to
keep
out
of
the
war
.


Moreover
,
the
Japanese
dared
not
use
mustard
gas
here
as
they
did
elsewhere
in
Shanghai
,
in
full
view
of
the
foreign
powers
.


This
proximity
drew
the
attention
,
if
only
briefly
,
of
the
international
community
to
Chiang
Kai-shek
's
bid
for
worldwide
support
against
Japanese
aggression
.


In
Chinese
,
the
423
defenders
are
known
as
the
Eight
Hundred
Heroes
,
because
commander
Xie
Jinyuan
not
wanting
to
reveal
their
true
strength
to
the
Japanese
,
provided
an
exaggerated
number
to
girl
guide
Yang
Huimin
to
announce
to
the
public
.


The
2010
IAAF
World
Cross
Country
Championships
were
held
at
Myślęcinek
Park
in
Bydgoszcz
,
Poland
on
28
March
2010
.


It
was
the
first
time
in
over
twenty
years
that
Poland
hosted
the
annual
championships
,
having
previously
held
them
in
Warsaw
in
1987
.


Kenyan
runners
dominated
the
competition
,
taking
all
four
individual
titles
and
all
four
team
titles
at
the
competition
.


Kenyans
took
the
top
four
spots
in
both
junior
men
's
and
junior
women
's
races
to
finish
with
a
perfect
team
score
.


In
the
absence
of
Zersenay
Tadese
and
Kenenisa
Bekele
,
the
senior
men
's
race
was
an
opportunity
for
less-established
runners
.


Joseph
Ebuya
won
the
gold
(
his
first
major
medal
)
,
becoming
the
first
Kenyan
to
win
the
men
's
race
since
Paul
Tergat
in
1999
.


Teklemariam
Medhin
of
Eritrea
took
second
place
(
also
his
first
major
medal
)
while
Moses
Ndiema
Kipsiro
of
Uganda
was
third
.


Kenya
won
the
senior
men
's
team
gold
with
ease
and
Eritrea
won
the
team
silver
medal
.


Defending
champion
Gebregziabher
Gebremariam
only
just
made
the
top
ten
but
led
Ethiopia
to
the
team
bronze
.


Florence
Kiplagat
was
not
present
to
defend
the
women
's
senior
title
,
leaving
Linet
Masai
and
Tirunesh
Dibaba
as
the
favourites
.


However
,
a
sprint
finish
by
little-known
runner
Emily
Chebet
rendered
Masai
the
silver
medallist
for
a
second
year
running
.


Meselech
Melkamu
of
Ethiopia
won
the
fourth
World
Cross
Country
bronze
of
her
career
as
Dibaba
finished
outside
the
medals
.


Kenya
and
Ethiopia
won
the
team
gold
and
silver
,
respectively
,
while
Shalane
Flanagan
led
the
United
States
women
's
team
to
a
bronze
medal
.


The
top
four
in
both
the
junior
men
and
women
's
races
were
all
Kenyan
,
with
Caleb
Mwangangi
Ndiku
and
Mercy
Cherono
the
gold
medallists
.


The
dominance
of
the
competition
by
Kenyan
and
East
African
runners
was
accompanied
by
a
decline
in
the
number
of
European
teams
that
were
entered
for
the
tournament
,
with
some
historically
strong
countries
sending
no
athletes
at
all
.


The
First
Javanese
War
of
Succession
was
a
struggle
between
Sultan
Amangkurat
III
of
Mataram
and
the
Dutch
East
India
Company
who
supported
the
claim
of
the
Sultan
's
uncle
,
Pangeran
Puger
to
the
throne
.


Amangkurat
II
died
in
1703
and
was
briefly
succeeded
by
his
son
,
Amangkurat
III
.


The
Dutch
believed
they
had
found
a
more
reliable
client
in
his
uncle
Pangeran
Puger
.


Tensions
increased
when
Amangkurat
was
accused
of
giving
refuge
to
the
rebel
Surapati
.


Pangeran
Puger
accused
Amangkurat
before
the
Dutch
of
planning
an
uprising
in
East
Java
.


Unlike
Pangeran
Puger
,
Amangkurat
III
inherited
blood
connection
with
Surabayan
ruler
,
Jangrana
II
,
from
Amangkurat
II
and
this
lent
credibility
to
the
allegation
that
he
cooperated
with
the
now
powerful
Untung
Surapati
in
Pasuruan
.


Panembahan
Cakraningrat
II
of
Madura
,
VOC
’
s
most
trusted
ally
,
persuaded
the
Dutch
to
support
Pangeran
Puger
.


Pangeran
Puger
took
the
title
of
Pakubuwana
I
upon
his
accession
in
June
1704
.


Together
with
the
Dutch
,
Pakubuwono
defeated
Amangkurat
who
fled
east
and
received
refuge
from
Surapati
who
had
set
up
his
own
kingdom
.


The
war
dragged
on
for
five
years
before
the
Dutch
managed
to
install
Pakubuwana
.


In
August
1705
,
Pakubuwono
I
’
s
retainers
and
VOC
forces
captured
Kartasura
without
resistance
from
Amangkurat
III
,
whose
forces
cowardly
turned
back
when
the
enemy
reached
Ungaran
.


Surapati
’
s
forces
in
Bangil
,
near
Pasuruan
,
was
crushed
by
the
alliance
of
VOC
,
Kartasura
and
Madura
in
1706
.


Jangrana
II
,
who
tended
to
side
with
Amangkurat
III
and
did
not
venture
any
assistance
to
the
capture
of
Bangil
,
was
called
to
present
himself
before
Pakubuwana
I
and
murdered
there
by
VOC
’
s
request
in
the
same
year
.


Amangkurat
III
ran
away
to
Malang
with
Surapati
’
s
descendants
and
his
remnant
forces
but
Malang
was
then
a
no-man
’
s-land
who
offered
no
glory
fit
for
a
king
.


Therefore
,
though
allied
operations
to
the
eastern
interior
of
Java
in
1706–08
did
not
gain
much
success
in
military
terms
,
the
fallen
king
surrendered
in
1708
after
being
lured
with
the
promises
of
household
(
lungguh
)
and
land
,
but
he
was
banished
to
Ceylon
along
with
his
wives
and
children
.


The
Murder
of
the
Hatuel
family
was
a
shooting
attack
on
May
2
,
2004
,
in
which
Palestinian
militants
killed
Tali
Hatuel
,
a
Jewish
settler
,
who
was
eight
months
pregnant
,
and
her
four
daughters
,
aged
two
to
eleven
.


The
attack
took
place
near
the
Kissufim
Crossing
near
their
home
in
Gush
Katif
bloc
of
Israeli
settlements
in
the
Gaza
Strip
during
the
Second
Intifada
.


After
shooting
at
the
vehicle
in
which
Hatuel
was
driving
with
her
daughters
,
witnesses
said
the
militants
approached
the
vehicle
and
shot
the
occupants
repeatedly
at
close
range
.


an
alliance
of
islamic
jihad
and
the
popular
resistance
committees
claimed
responsibility
for
the
attack
,
stating
that
it
was
carried
out
in
reprisal
for
the
assassinations
of
hamas
leaders
sheikh
ahmad
yassin
and
abdelaziz
rantisi
by
the
israeli
army
some
weeks
earlier
.


The
attack
shocked
the
Israeli
public
,
and
was
classified
by
Amnesty
International
as
a
crime
against
humanity
.


On
June
6
,
2007
,
the
IDF
arrested
Jihad
Salah
Saliman
Abu
Dahar
,
a
Palestinian
member
of
Islamic
Jihad
from
the
Khan
Yunis
area
,
who
according
to
Shin
Bet
officials
admitted
to
several
acts
of
violence
,
including
the
attack
on
Hatuel
and
her
daughters
.


On
August
18
,
2011
,
a
series
of
cross-border
attacks
with
parallel
attacks
and
mutual
cover
was
carried
out
in
southern
Israel
on
Highway
12
near
the
Egyptian
border
by
a
squad
of
presumably
12
militants
in
four
groups
.


The
attacks
occurred
after
Israel
's
interior
security
service
Shin
Bet
had
warned
of
an
attack
by
militants
in
the
region
and
Israeli
troops
had
been
stationed
in
the
area
.


The
militants
first
opened
fire
at
an
Egged
No
.


392
bus
as
it
was
traveling
on
Highway
12
in
the
Negev
near
Eilat
.


Several
minutes
later
,
a
bomb
was
detonated
next
to
an
Israeli
army
patrol
along
Israel
's
border
with
Egypt
.


In
a
third
attack
,
an
anti-tank
missile
hit
a
private
vehicle
,
killing
four
civilians
.


Eight
Israelis
–
six
civilians
,
one
Yamam
special
unit
police
sniper
and
one
Golani
Brigade
soldier—were
killed
in
the
multiple-stage
attack
.


the
israel
defense
forces
reported
eight
attackers
killed
,
and
egyptian
security
forces
reported
killing
another
two
.


Five
Egyptian
soldiers
were
also
killed
.


According
to
Egypt
,
they
were
killed
by
Israeli
security
forces
chasing
militants
across
the
Egyptian
border
,
while
an
Israeli
military
officer
initially
said
they
were
killed
by
a
suicide
bomber
who
had
fled
across
the
border
into
Egypt
.


The
five
deaths
triggered
a
diplomatic
row
between
Egypt
and
Israel
and
led
to
mass
protests
outside
the
Israeli
embassy
in
Cairo
.


According
to
media
reports
,
Egypt
threatened
to
withdraw
its
ambassador
to
Israel
,
but
Egypt
's
foreign
minister
later
denied
this
.


Israel
expressed
regret
over
the
deaths
,
and
sent
a
letter
of
apology
to
Egypt.

The
IDF
was
ordered
to
conduct
a
military
probe
of
the
incident
,
and
on
August
25
,
2011
,
Israel
agreed
to
a
joint
investigation
with
Egypt
of
the
events
.


The
identity
of
the
attackers
,
three
of
whom
were
reportedly
Egyptian
,
is
not
widely
agreed
upon
,
and
so
far
no
group
took
responsibility
for
the
attacks
.


the
israeli
government
accused
the
palestinian
popular
resistance
committees
(
prc
)
,
a
unk
coalition
of
palestinian
militant
groups
,
of
orchestrating
the
attacks
,
but
the
prc
denies
involvement
.


However
,
Israel
attacked
seven
targets
in
the
Gaza
Strip
immediately
after
the
terror
attacks
in
the
Negev
,
killing
five
members
of
the
PRC
,
including
its
leader
.


On
August
21
,
2011
,
an
informal
ceasefire
was
called
by
Israel
and
Hamas
after
days
of
escalating
violence
in
which
fifteen
Palestinians
were
killed
and
many
were
wounded
.


More
than
100
rockets
and
mortar
shells
were
fired
from
Gaza
into
Israel
,
killing
one
Israeli
and
wounding
more
than
a
dozen
.


The
ceasefire
was
broken
almost
immediately
by
rocket
fire
from
Gaza
on
southern
Israel
,
followed
by
retaliatory
Israeli
airstrikes
,
killing
at
least
seven
Palestinians
,
among
them
two
leaders
of
the
Islamic
Jihad
.


On
August
26
,
2011
,
Gaza
militants
called
a
second
truce
.


on
march
9
,
2012
,
israel
air
force
,
in
a
strike
on
palestinian
targets
in
gaza
,
killed
the
secretary-general
of
the
popular

committees
,
unk

,
whom
israel
considers
as
``
one
of
the
masterminds
''
of
the
august

,
2011
attacks
.


The
Great
Railroad
Strike
of
1877
sometimes
referred
to
as
the
Great
Upheaval
,
began
on
July
14
in
Martinsburg
,
West
Virginia
,
United
States
after
the
Baltimore
and
Ohio
Railroad
(
B
&
O
)
cut
wages
for
the
third
time
in
a
year
.


This
strike
finally
ended
some
45
days
later
,
after
it
was
put
down
by
local
and
state
militias
,
and
federal
troops
.


Because
of
economic
problems
and
pressure
on
wages
by
the
railroads
,
workers
in
numerous
other
cities
,
in
New
York
,
Pennsylvania
and
Maryland
,
into
Illinois
and
Missouri
,
also
went
out
on
strike
.


An
estimated
100
people
were
killed
in
the
unrest
across
the
country
.


In
Martinsburg
,
Pittsburgh
,
Philadelphia
and
other
cities
,
workers
burned
down
and
destroyed
both
physical
facilities
and
the
rolling
stock
of
the
railroads—engines
and
railroad
cars
.


Local
populations
feared
that
workers
were
rising
in
revolution
such
as
the
Paris
Commune
of
1871
.


at
the
time
,
the
workers
were
not
represented
by
trade
unions
.


The
city
and
state
governments
organized
armed
militias
,
aided
by
national
guard
,
federal
troops
and
private
militias
organized
by
the
railroads
,
who
fought
against
the
workers
.


Disruption
was
widespread
and
at
its
height
,
the
strikes
were
supported
by
about
100,000
workers
.


With
the
intervention
of
federal
troops
in
several
locations
,
most
of
the
strikes
were
suppressed
by
early
August
.


Labor
continued
to
work
to
organize
into
unions
to
work
for
better
wages
and
conditions
.


Fearing
the
social
disruption
,
many
cities
built
armories
to
support
their
militias
;
these
defensive
buildings
still
stand
as
symbols
of
the
effort
to
suppress
the
labor
unrest
of
this
period
.


With
public
attention
on
workers
'
wages
and
conditions
,
the
B
&
O
in
1880
founded
an
Employee
Relief
Association
to
provide
death
benefits
and
some
health
care
.


In
1884
it
established
a
worker
pension
plan
.


Other
improvements
generally
had
to
await
further
economic
growth
and
associated
wage
increases
.


The
1704
Raid
on
Deerfield
(
also
known
as
the
Deerfield
Massacre
)
occurred
during
Queen
Anne
's
War
on
February
29
when
French
and
Native
American
forces
under
the
command
of
Jean-Baptiste
Hertel
de
Rouville
attacked
the
English
frontier
settlement
at
Deerfield
,
Massachusetts
,
just
before
dawn
.


They
burned
part
of
the
town
and
killed
47
villagers
.


The
raiders
left
with
112
settlers
as
captives
,
whom
they
took
overland
the
nearly
300
miles
to
Montreal
.


Some
died
along
the
way
,
and
60
were
later
redeemed
(
ransomed
by
family
and
community
)
.


Others
were
adopted
by
Mohawk
families
and
became
assimilated
into
the
tribe
.


In
this
period
,
the
English
and
their
Indian
allies
were
involved
in
similar
raids
against
French
villages
along
the
northern
area
between
the
spheres
of
influence
.


Typical
of
the
small-scale
frontier
conflict
in
Queen
Anne
's
War
,
the
French-led
raid
relied
on
a
coalition
of
French
soldiers
and
a
variety
of
about
300
Indian
warriors
,
mostly
Abenaki
but
including
a
number
of
Pocumtuc
who
had
once
lived
in
the
Deerfield
area
.


Given
the
diversity
of
personnel
,
motivations
,
and
material
objectives
,
the
raiders
did
not
achieve
full
surprise
when
they
entered
the
palisaded
village
.


The
defenders
of
some
fortified
houses
in
the
village
successfully
held
off
the
raiders
until
arriving
reinforcements
prompted
their
retreat
.


However
,
the
raid
was
a
clear
victory
for
the
French
coalition
that
aimed
to
take
captives
and
unsettle
English
colonial
frontier
society
.


More
than
100
captives
were
taken
,
and
about
40
percent
of
the
village
houses
were
destroyed
.


although
predicted
because
of
existing
tensions
during
the
war
,
the
raid
shocked
new
england
colonists
.


Conflict
increased
with
the
French
and
their
Native
American
allies
.


Frontier
settlements
took
actions
to
fortify
their
towns
and
prepare
for
war
.


The
raid
has
been
immortalized
as
a
part
of
the
early
American
frontier
story
,
principally
due
to
the
published
account
by
a
prominent
captive
,
the
Rev
.


John
Williams
.


He
and
much
of
his
family
were
taken
on
the
long
overland
journey
to
Canada
.


His
young
daughter
Eunice
was
adopted
by
a
Mohawk
family
;
she
became
assimilated
and
married
a
Mohawk
man
.


Williams
'
account
,
``
The
Redeemed
Captive
''
,
was
published
in
1707
and
was
widely
popular
in
the
colonies
.


The
Siege
of
Madrid
was
a
two
and
a
half
year
siege
of
the
Spanish
capital
city
of
Madrid
,
during
the
Spanish
Civil
War
of
1936
to
1939
.


The
city
,
besieged
from
October
1936
,
eventually
fell
to
the
Francoist
armies
on
28
March
1939
.


Madrid
was
held
by
various
forces
loyal
to
the
Spanish
Republic
and
was
besieged
and
subject
to
aerial
bombardment
by
the
rebel
faction
under
General
Francisco
Franco
.


The
Battle
of
Madrid
in
November
1936
saw
the
most
intense
fighting
in
and
around
the
city
when
the
Nationalists
made
their
most
determined
attempt
to
take
the
Republican
capital
.


The
highest
military
awards
of
the
Spanish
Republic
,
the
Laureate
Plate
of
Madrid
(
)
and
the
Madrid
Distinction
(
)
,
established
by
the
Republican
government
in
order
to
reward
courage
,
were
named
after
the
capital
of
Spain
owing
to
the
city
symbolizing
valour
and
Antifascist
resistance
during
the
long
siege
throughout
the
Civil
War
.


Uprising
—
Madrid
held
for
the
Republic
(
July
1936
)
.


The
Spanish
Civil
War
began
with
a
failed
``
coup
d'état
''
against
the
Popular
Front
Government
of
the
Spanish
Republic
by
right-wing
Spanish
Army
officers
on
18
July
1936
.


In
Madrid
,
the
Republican
government
was
unsure
of
what
to
do
.


It
wanted
to
put
down
the
coup
,
but
was
unsure
if
it
could
trust
the
armed
forces
and
did
not
want
to
arm
the
Confederación
Nacional
del
Trabajo
(
CNT
)
and
Unión
General
de
Trabajadores
(
UGT
)
trade
unions
and
potentially
accelerate
the
ongoing
Spanish
revolution
.


On
18
July
,
the
government
sent
units
of
the
Guardia
Civil
to
Seville
to
put
down
the
rebellion
there
.


However
,
on
reaching
the
city
the
guardias
defected
to
the
insurgents
.


On
19
July
Santiago
Casares
Quiroga
resigned
as
Prime
Minister
,
to
be
succeeded
by
Diego
Martinez
Barrio
.


He
tried
to
arrange
a
truce
with
the
insurgent
general
Emilio
Mola
by
telephone
,
but
Mola
refused
the
offer
and
Martinez
Barrio
was
ousted
as
Prime
Minister
by
José
Giral
.


Giral
agreed
to
arm
the
trade
unionists
in
defence
of
the
Republic
,
and
had
60,000
rifles
delivered
to
the
CNT
and
UGT
headquarters
,
although
only
5,000
were
in
working
order
.


In
a
radio
broadcast
on
the
18th
,
the
communist
leader
Dolores
Ibarruri
coined
the
famous
slogan
``
¡No
pasarán
!
''


(
``
They
shall
not
pass
''
)
,
urging
resistance
against
the
coup
.


The
slogan
was
to
become
synonymous
with
the
defence
of
Madrid
and
the
Republican
cause
in
general
.


at
the
same
time
,
general
UNK
fanjul
,
commander
of
the
military
garrison
based
in
UNK
barracks
in
madrid
,
was
preparing
to
launch
the
military
rebellion
in
the
city
.


However
,
when
he
tried
to
march
out
of
the
barracks
,
his
2,500
troops
were
forced
back
inside
the
compound
by
hostile
crowds
and
armed
trade
unionists
.


On
the
20th
,
the
barracks
was
stormed
by
a
mixture
of
workers
and
``
Guardias
de
Asalto
''
(
``
assault
guards
''
,
an
urban
police
force
)
loyal
to
the
government
,
as
well
as
five
battalions
of
the
Communist-led
Antifascist
Worker
and
Peasant
Militias
(
MAOC
)
—one
of
these
battalions
became
the
famous
``
Fifth
Regiment
''
—
totaling
about
10,000
fighters
.


The
fighting
was
chaotic
,
and
on
several
occasions
some
soldiers
within
the
barracks
indicated
their
willingness
to
surrender
,
only
for
other
troops
to
keep
firing
at
the
attackers
,
killing
those
who
had
broken
cover
to
take
them
prisoner
.


Eventually
the
barracks
fell
when
the
``
Guardias
de
Asalto
''
brought
up
a
75
mm
field
gun
to
bombard
the
complex
and
its
gate
was
opened
by
a
sapper
sergeant
sympathetic
to
the
Republican
side
.


The
sergeant
was
killed
by
one
of
his
officers
,
but
his
action
allowed
the
Republicans
to
breach
the
walls
.


A
number
of
soldiers
were
massacred
by
the
crowd
,
enraged
by
the
apparent
false
surrenders
,
after
the
fall
of
the
barracks
.


Thereafter
and
for
the
remainder
of
the
war
,
Madrid
was
held
by
the
Republicans
.


However
,
its
population
contained
a
significant
number
of
right-wing
sympathisers
.


over
20,000
right-wingers
sought
refuge
in
foreign
embassies
in
the
city
.


The
weeks
that
followed
the
July
uprising
,
saw
a
number
of
so-called
fascists
or
fascist
sympathisers
being
killed
in
Madrid
by
Republicans
.


For
example
,
on
23
August
70
prisoners
from
the
``
Modelo
''
Prison
in
the
city
were
massacred
in
revenge
for
the
Nationalist
killing
of
over
1,500
Republicans
after
the
storming
of
Badajoz
.


Nationalist
``
Drive
on
Madrid
''
(
August–October
1936
)
.


The
initial
strategy
of
the
military
plot
had
been
to
assume
power
all
over
the
country
in
the
manner
of
a
``
Pronunciamiento
''
(
military
coup
)
of
the
19th
century
.


However
,
the
resistance
to
the
coup
by
Republicans
meant
that
instead
of
this
,
Franco
and
his
allies
would
have
to
conquer
the
country
by
military
force
if
they
wanted
to
seize
power
.


Franco
himself
had
landed
in
Algeciras
in
southern
Spain
with
Moroccan
troops
from
the
Spanish
Army
of
Africa
.


Mola
,
who
was
in
command
of
the
colonial
troops
as
well
as
the
Spanish
Foreign
Legion
and
Carlist
and
Falangist
militia
,
raised
troops
in
the
north
.


Together
,
they
planned
a
``
Drive
on
Madrid
''
to
take
the
Spanish
capital
,
Franco
advancing
from
Badajoz
,
which
he
took
in
August
and
Mola
from
Burgos
.


Franco
's
veteran
colonial
troops
,
or
``
regulares
''
,
under
General
Yague
,
along
with
air
cover
supplied
by
Nazi
Germany
,
routed
the
Republican
militias
in
their
path
.


Yague
argued
for
a
rapid
advance
on
Madrid
,
but
Franco
overruled
him
in
favour
of
relieving
the
Nationalist
troops
besieged
in
Toledo
.


This
diversion
held
up
their
attack
on
Madrid
by
up
to
a
month
—
giving
the
Republicans
time
to
prepare
its
defence
.


Meanwhile
,
in
the
city
,
the
Republican
government
had
reformed
under
the
leadership
of
socialist
leader
Francisco
Largo
Caballero
.


caballero
's
government
included
six
socialist
party
ministers
,
two
communists
,
two
from
the
republican
left
party
,
one
from
the
catalan
left
party
,
one
basque
nationalist
party
and
one
republican
union
minister
.


although
the
communists
were
a
minority
in
the
government
,
they
gained
in
influence
through
their
access
to
arms
from
the
ussr
and
foreign
volunteers
in
the
international
brigades
.


The
Republican
military
commander
in
Madrid
was
nominally
a
Spanish
general
,
Jose
Miaja
,
but
Soviet
military
personnel
were
perhaps
more
important
.


General
Goriev
was
their
overall
commander
.


General
Smushkevic
controlled
the
air
forces
sent
from
the
USSR
and
General
Dmitry
Pavlov
commanded
their
armoured
forces
.


Most
of
the
Republican
defenders
of
Madrid
(
c.90
%
)
were
militias
,
raised
by
left-wing
political
parties
or
trade
unions
,
who
elected
their
own
leaders
.


The
Republican
command
had
relatively
little
control
over
these
units
in
the
early
phase
of
the
Civil
War
.


On
the
other
side
,
both
Nazi
Germany
and
Fascist
Italy
supplied
Franco
with
air
cover
and
armoured
units
for
his
assault
on
Madrid
,
while
the
Luftwaffe
units
in
Spain
,
the
Condor
Legion
,
were
commanded
independently
of
Franco
's
officers
.


The
Nationalists
reached
Madrid
in
early
November
1936
,
approaching
it
from
the
north
along
the
Corunna
Road
and
west
Extremadura
road
.


On
29
October
,
a
Republican
counterattack
by
the
5th
(
communist
)
regiment
under
Enrique
Líster
was
beaten
off
at
Parla
.


On
2
November
,
Brunete
fell
to
the
nationalists
,
leaving
their
troops
at
the
western
suburb
of
Madrid
.


Mola
famously
remarked
to
an
English
journalist
that
he
would
take
Madrid
with
his
four
columns
,
of
regular
and
Moroccan
troops
from
southwest
in
Spain
,
outside
the
city
and
his
``
Fifth
column
''
-
composed
of
right
wing
sympathisers
within
it
.


The
term
``
fifth
column
''
became
a
synonym
for
spies
or
traitors
on
the
Republican
side
and
paranoia
regarding
them
led
to
massacre
of
Nationalist
prisoners
in
Madrid
during
the
ensuing
battle
.


The
government
including
Caballero
expected
Madrid
to
fall
and
so
made
a
pre-planned
move
from
Madrid
on
6
November
to
Valencia
.


General
Miaja
and
the
political
leaders
who
remained
formed
the
``
Junta
de
Defensa
de
Madrid
''
(
Committee
for
the
Defence
of
Madrid
)
to
organise
the
republican
defenders
.


However
,
the
Nationalists
'
attempt
to
capture
Madrid
had
some
serious
tactical
drawbacks
.


For
one
thing
,
their
troops
were
outnumbered
over
two
to
one
by
the
defenders
(
although
the
Nationalists
were
far
better
trained
and
equipped
)
.


Another
disadvantage
was
their
inability
to
surround
Madrid
and
to
cut
if
off
from
outside
help
.

The
Geneva
International
Motor
Show
is
an
annual
auto
show
held
in
March
in
the
Swiss
city
of
Geneva
.


The
show
is
hosted
at
the
Palexpo
,
a
convention
centre
located
next
to
the
Geneva
Cointrin
International
Airport
.


The
Salon
is
organised
by
the
Organisation
Internationale
des
Constructeurs
d'Automobiles
,
and
is
considered
an
important
major
international
auto
show
.


First
held
in
1905
,
the
Salon
has
hosted
almost
all
major
internal
combustion
engined
models
in
the
history
of
the
automobile
,
along
with
benzene-
and
steam-powered
cars
from
the
beginning
of
the
century
.


Exotic
supercars
often
steal
the
spotlight
during
their
debuts
at
the
show
.


Prototypes
,
new

,
technical
breakthroughs
,
international
partnerships
,
as
well
as
political

social
debates
,
have
been

.


The

is
regarded
as
a
level
playing
field
for
the
world

Switzerland
lacks

The
shooting
of
Ramarley
Graham
took
place
in
the
borough
of
the
Bronx
in
New
York
City
on
February
2
,
2012
.


Richard
Haste
,
a
New
York
Police
Department
officer
,
shot
Graham
in
the
bathroom
of
Graham
's
apartment
.


The
officer
Michael
Best
had
been
informed
that
Graham
had
a
gun
and
believed
that
Graham
had
been
reaching
for
a
gun
in
his
waistband
after
disregarding
police
orders
and
shouting
expletives
at
police
.


Haste
was
charged
with
manslaughter
,
but
the
charge
was
dropped
.


Graham
's
family
filed
a
lawsuit
against
the
city
of
New
York
,
and
the
lawsuit
was
settled
for
$
3.9
million
in
2015
.


The
NYPD
Firearms
Discharge
Review
Board
found
the
shooting
to
be
within
department
guidelines
.


In
2016
,
under
pressure
from
DeBlasio
and
prior
to
Bratton
's
resignation
,
Haste
was
offered
to
vest
out
with
all
benefits
,
in
spite
of
having
been
cleared
of
all
criminal
charges
and
found
within
guidelines
.


Haste
opted
to
go
to
department
trial
.


In
2017
,
an
internal
NYPD
investigation
explored
whether
Haste
used
``
poor
tactics
''
leading
up
to
the
shooting
.


Haste
ultimately
resigned
from
the
NYPD
rather
than
allow
himself
to
be
terminated
.


Tamir
Rice
(
25
June
2002
-
23
November
2014
)
was
a
12-year
old
African-American
boy
shot
by
26-year-old
police
officer
Timothy
Loehmann
on
22
November
2014
in
Cleveland
,
Ohio
.


Two
police
officers
,
Loehmann
and
46-year-old
Frank
Garmback
,
responded
after
receiving
a
police
dispatch
call
regarding
a
black
male
that
``
keeps
pulling
a
gun
out
of
his
pants
and
pointing
it
at
people
''
.


A
caller
reported
that
a
male
was
pointing
``
a
pistol
''
at
random
people
at
the
Cudell
Recreation
Center
,
a
park
in
the
City
of
Cleveland
's
Public
Works
Department
.


at
the
beginning
of
the
call
and
again
in
the
middle
,
he
says
of
the
pistol
``
it
's
probably
fake
''
.


Toward
the
end
of
the
two-minute
call
,
the
caller
states
that
``
he
is
probably
a
juvenile
''
;
however
,
this
information
was
not
relayed
to
officers
Loehmann
or
Garmback
on
the
initial
dispatch
.


The
officers
reported
that
upon
their
arrival
,
they
both
continuously
yelled
``
show
me
your
hands
''
through
the
open
patrol
car
window
.


Loehmann
further
claimed
that
instead
of
showing
his
hands
,
it
appeared
as
if
Rice
was
trying
to
draw
:
``
I
knew
it
was
a
gun
and
I
knew
it
was
coming
out
''
.


In
response
,
the
officer
shot
twice
,
hitting
Rice
once
in
the
torso
.


He
died
on
the
following
day
.


Rice
's
gun
was
later
found
to
be
an
airsoft
replica
that
lacked
the
orange-tipped
barrel
,
which
would
have
indicated
it
being
a
nonlethal
gun
.


A
surveillance
video
of
the
incident
was
released
by
police
four
days
after
the
shooting
,
on
26
November
.


On
3
June
2015
,
the
Cuyahoga
County
Sheriff
's
Office
released
a
statement
in
which
they
declared
their
investigation
to
be
completed
and
that
they
had
turned
their
findings
over
to
the
county
prosecutor
.


Several
months
later
,
the
prosecution
presented
evidence
to
a
grand
jury
,
which
declined
to
indict
,
primarily
on
the
basis
that
Rice
was
drawing
what
appears
to
be
an
actual
firearm
from
his
waist
as
the
police
arrived
.


A
lawsuit
brought
against
the
city
of
Cleveland
by
Rice
's
family
was
subsequently
settled
for
$
6
million
in
an
effort
to
reduce
taxpayer
liabilities
.


In
the
aftermath
of
the
shooting
,
it
was
revealed
that
Loehmann
,
in
his
previous
job
as
a
police
officer
in
the
Cleveland
suburb
of
Independence
,
had
been
deemed
an
emotionally
unstable
recruit
and
unfit
for
duty
.


Loehmann
did
not
disclose
this
fact
on
his
application
to
join
the
Cleveland
police
,
and
Cleveland
police
never
reviewed
his
previous
personnel
file
before
hiring
him
.


In
2017
,
following
an
investigation
,
Loehmann
was
fired
for
withholding
this
information
on
his
application
.


An
FBI
review
by
retired
agent
Kimberly
Crawford
found
that
Rice
's
death
was
justified
and
Loehmann
's
``
response
was
a
reasonable
one
''
.


The
incident
received
national
and
international
coverage
and
occurred
around
the
time
of
several
other
high
profile
police
shootings
of
black
males
.


The
Fountain
Valley
massacre
was
a
mass
shooting
that
occurred
on
the
afternoon
of
6
September
1972
at
the
Fountain
Valley
Golf
Course
in
St.
Croix
,
United
States
Virgin
Islands
.


The
shooting
left
eight
employees
and
tourists
dead
.


Another
eight
were
either
shot
at
or
wounded
.


The
alleged
perpetrators
were
five
Virgin
Islanders
whom
authorities
initially
believed
to
have
committed
the
execution-style
shooting
in
the
course
of
a
robbery
gone
bad
.


However
,
in
court
,
the
defense
,
led
by
civil
rights
activists
William
Kunstler
and
Chauncey
Eskridge
,
argued
in
part
that
the
accused
were
politically
motivated
victims
of
systematic
race-based
civil
rights
deprivation
;
all
of
the
defendants
were
Afro-Caribbean
men
,
while
seven
of
the
eight
victims
were
white
.


Two
of
the
accused
,
Raphael
Joseph
and
Warren
Ballentine
,
explained
that
they
had
only
planned
on
committing
a
robbery
,
and
that
things
got
out
of
hand
because
one
of
the
co-defendants
,
Ishmael
LaBeet
,
was
adamant
that
they
also
make
``
a
political
statement
''
because
``
he
was
angry
about
foreigners
coming
in
to
take
our
money
and
leaving
us
with
nothing
.
''


According
to
Joseph
,
LaBeet
,
during
the
commission
of
the
robbery
,
suddenly
began
shooting
people
while
yelling
epithets
like
,
``
I
hate
you
white
motherfuckers
!
''


LaBeet
,
who
escaped
from
custody
and
fled
to
Cuba
in
1984
,
has
denied
this
version
of
events
,
as
well
as
any
involvement
at
all
in
the
shooting
.


All
five
men
were
convicted
of
multiple
charges
of
murder
,
assault
,
and
robbery
,
and
each
was
sentenced
to
eight
consecutive
life
sentences
in
federal
detention
.


The
public
's
perception
of
a
racially
tinged
motivation
for
the
killings
and
fear
of
further
violence
led
to
a
steep
decline
in
tourism
to
St.
Croix
,
from
which
the
island
's
tourism
industry
did
not
begin
to
recover
until
decades
later
.


On
31
December
1984
,
one
of
the
convicted
men
,
Ishmael
LaBeet
,
hijacked
American
Airlines
Flight
626
while
in
United
States
federal
custody
on
a
transfer
to
new
detention
.


The
flight
was
forced
to
land
in
Cuba
,
where
LaBeet
escaped
.


He
was
never
recaptured
by
the
United
States
and
,
with
the
thawing
of
Cuban–American
relations
in
2015
,
was
confirmed
to
be
living
at
large
in
Cuba
following
an
indeterminate
amount
of
time
spent
in
a
Cuban
prison
.


Three
of
the
five
men
remain
in
prison
;
another
is
deceased
.


LaBeet
was
the
subject
of
the
2016
documentary
film
``
The
Skyjacker
's
Tale
''
.


Air
Algérie
Flight
6289
(
AH6289
)
,
was
a
domestic
passenger
flight
which
crashed
on
6
March
2003
,
at
the
Aguenar
–
Hadj
Bey
Akhamok
Airport
in
Algeria
,
killing
all
but
one
of
the
103
people
on
board
.


Witnesses
recalled
that
one
of
its
engines
exploded
and
caught
fire
just
seconds
after
takeoff
.


The
landing
gear
was
still
extended
when
this
happened
.


It
then
rose
sharply
and
stalled
.


The
final
report
concluded
that
the
cause
of
the
crash
was
due
to
engine
failure
on
take-off
.


This
was
aggravated
by
the
Captain
's
decision
to
take
over
control
without
understanding
the
situation
and
subsequent
miscommunication
between
the
Captain
and
the
First
Officer
.


the
accident
was
the
deadliest
plane
crash
to
occur
on
algerian
soil
,
until
being
surpassed
by
the
algerian
air
force
il-76
crash
in
2018
.


it
was
also

The
1960
Concepción
earthquakes
were
a
succession
of
three
destructive
earthquakes
that
happened
between
21
and
22
May
1960
.


They
formed
part
of
the
foreshock
sequence
for
the
1960
Valdivia
earthquake
,
the
largest
recorded
earthquake
in
history
.


The
first
was
on
May
21
at
06:02
UTC-4
.


Its
epicenter
was
near
Cañete
,
Bío
Bío
Region
,
Chile
,
and
its
magnitude
was
8.1
or
8.3M
and
7.3
or
7.5M
.


This
earthquake
,
which
lasted
35
seconds
,
destroyed
a
third
of
the
buildings
in
the
city
of
Concepción
.


The
earthquake
effectively
interrupted
and
ended
Lota
's
coal
miners
march
on
Concepción
where
they
demanded
higher
salaries
.


The
second
happened
on
May
22
at
06:30
UTC-4
.


Its
epicenter
was
in
the
Nahuelbuta
National
Park
,
Araucanía
Region
,
Chile
,
and
its
magnitude
was
7.1
M.
It
was
followed
by
a
6.8
M
earthquake
at
06:32
UTC-4
.


The
third
happened
the
same
day
at
14:56
UTC-4
.


Its
epicenter
was
near
Purén
,
Araucanía
Region
,
Chile
and
its
magnitude
was
7.8

This
earthquake
happened
15
minutes
before

.


The
Irish
Rebellion
of
1641
(
)
began
as
an
attempted
``
coup
d'état
''
by
Irish
Catholic
gentry
,
who
tried
to
seize
control
of
the
English
administration
in
Ireland
to
force
concessions
for
Catholics
.


The
coup
failed
and
the
rebellion
developed
into
an
ethnic
conflict
between
the
Gaelic
Irish
and
old
English
Catholics
on
one
side
,
and
both
ethnically
English
Protestants
and
Scottish/Presbyterian
planters
on
the
other
.


This
began
a
conflict
known
as
the
Irish
Confederate
Wars
.


The
rising
was
sparked
by
Catholic
fears
of
an
impending
invasion
of
Ireland
by
anti-Catholic
forces
of
the
English
Long
Parliament
and
the
Scottish
Covenanters
,
who
were
defying
the
authority
of
King
Charles
I
(
king
of
England
,
Scotland
,
and
Ireland
)
.


In
turn
,
the
rebels
'
suspected
association
with
Charles
helped
start
the
English
Civil
War
.


The
English
and
Scottish
Parliaments
refused
to
raise
an
army
to
put
down
the
rebellion
unless
it
was
under
their
command
rather
than
the
King
's
.


The
Irish
rebellion
broke
out
in
October
1641
and
was
followed
by
several
months
of
violent
chaos
before
the
Irish
Catholic
upper
classes
and
clergy
formed
the
Catholic
Confederation
in
the
summer
of
1642
.


The
Confederation
became
a
de
facto
government
of
most
of
Ireland
,
free
from
the
control
of
the
English
administration
and
loosely
aligned
with
the
Royalist
side
in
the
Wars
of
the
Three
Kingdoms
.


The
subsequent
Irish
Confederate
Wars
continued
in
Ireland
until
the
1650s
,
when
Oliver
Cromwell
's
New
Model
Army
decisively
defeated
the
Irish
Catholics
and
Royalists
,
and
re-conquered
the
country
.


The
1641
Irish
Rebellion
is
seen
as
a
key
event
in
the
mid-17th
century
collapse
of
the
Stuart
monarchy
.


On
Saturday
,
21
September
2013
,
four
masked
gunmen
attacked
the
Westgate
shopping
mall
,
an
upscale
mall
in
Nairobi
,
Kenya
.


There
are
conflicting
reports
about
the
number
killed
in
the
attack
,
since
part
of
the
mall
collapsed
due
to
a
fire
that
started
during
the
siege
.


The
attack
resulted
in
71
total
deaths
,
including
62
civilians
,
five
Kenyan
soldiers
,
and
four
attackers
.


Approximately
200
people
were
wounded
in
the
mass
shooting
.


The
extremist
Islamic
group
al-Shabaab
claimed
responsibility
for
the
incident
,
which
it
characterised
as
retribution
for
the
Kenyan
military
's
deployment
in
the
group
's
home
country
of
Somalia
.


Many
media
outlets
also
suspected
the
insurgent
group
's
involvement
in
the
attack
based
on
earlier
reprisal
warnings
it
had
issued
in
the
wake
of
Operation
Linda
Nchi
from
2011
to
2012
.


Kenyan
authorities
arrested
dozens
of
people
in
the
aftermath
of
the
attack
,
but
had
not
announced
any
suspects
directly
related
to
the
siege
.


On
4
November
2013
,
a
Kenyan
court
charged
four
Somali
nationals
with
harbouring
the
gunmen
in
their
homes
,
with
each
pleading
not
guilty
.


On
20
September
2015
,
``
Foreign
Policy
''
magazine
reported
the
Westgate
attack
on
21
September
lasted
several
hours
,
with
the
last
victim
killed
before
special
Kenyan
security
forces
entered
the
mall
,
which
was
also
corroborated
by
New
York
City
Police
Department
,
HBO
,
and
United
States
Army

The

was
officially
declared

on

September
.


The
2012
Burgas
bus
bombing
was
a
terrorist
attack
carried
out
by
a
suicide
bomber
on
a
passenger
bus
transporting
Israeli
tourists
at
the
Burgas
Airport
in
Burgas
,
Bulgaria
,
on
18
July
2012
.


The
bus
was
carrying
42
Israelis
,
mainly
youths
,
from
the
airport
to
their
hotels
,
after
arriving
on
a
flight
from
Tel
Aviv
.


The
explosion
killed
the
Bulgarian
bus
driver
and
five
Israelis
and
injured
32
Israelis
,
resulting
in
international
condemnation
of
the
bombing
.


In
February
2013
,
Tsvetan
Tsvetanov
,
the
Bulgarian
Interior
Minister
,
said
there
was
``
well-grounded
''
evidence
that
Hezbollah
was
behind
the
attack
.


Tsvetanov
stated
that
the
two
suspects
had
Canadian
and
Australian
passports
and
lived
in
Lebanon
.


According
to
the
Europol
,
forensic
evidence
and
intelligence
sources
all
point
to
Hezbollah
's
involvement
in
the
blast
.


Both
Iran
and
Hezbollah
have
denied
any
involvement
.


On
5
June
2013
,
new
Bulgarian
Foreign
Affairs
Minister
Kristian
Vigenin
stated
that
:
``
There
is
no
conclusive
evidence
for
the
implication
of
Hezbollah
in
the
July
2012
bombing
in
Burgas
.


The
authorities
continue
to
gather
evidence
.
''


However
,
two
weeks
later
a
Bulgarian
representative
to
the
European
Union
revealed
that
investigators
discovered
new
evidence
that
implicates
Hezbollah
operatives
were
connected
to
the
terrorist
attacks
.


Investigators
found
that
the
forged
documents
used
by
the
perpetrators
of
the
attack
were
facilitated
by
a
man
with
ties
to
Hezbollah
.


In
July
2013
,
the
newly
appointed
Bulgarian
Interior
Minister
Tsvetlin
Yovchev
stated
:
``
there
are
clear
signs
that
say
Hezbollah
is
behind
the
Burgas
bombing
.
''


On
25
July
2013
,
the
Bulgarian
Interior
Ministry
released
photographs
of
two
Hezbollah
operatives
suspected
in
the
bombing
:
Australian
citizen
Malid
Farah
(
also
known
as
``
Hussein
Hussein
''
)
,
and
Canadian
citizen
Hassan
al-Haj
.


In
2013
,
and
partly
in
response
to
the
bombing
,
the
EU
unanimously
voted
to
list
the
military
branch
of
Hezbollah
as
a
terrorist
organization
.


On
18
July
2014
,
Bulgaria
announced
that
they
identified
the
bomber
as
a
dual
Lebanese-French
citizen
named
Mohamad
Hassan
El-Husseini
.


The
Dunmanway
killings
,
also
known
as
the
Dunmanway
murders
or
the
Dunmanway
massacre
,
refers
to
the
killing
(
and
in
some
cases
,
disappearances
)
of
thirteen
Protestant
men
and
boys
in
and
around
Dunmanway
,
County
Cork
,
between
26–28
April
1922
.


This
happened
in
a
period
of
truce
after
the
end
of
the
Irish
War
of
Independence
(
in
July
1921
)
and
before
the
outbreak
of
the
Irish
Civil
War
in
June
1922
.


All
the
dead
and
missing
were
Protestants
,
which
has
led
to
the
killings
being
described
as
sectarian
.


Six
were
killed
as
purported
British
informers
and
loyalists
,
while
four
others
were
relatives
killed
in
the
absence
of
the
target
.


Three
other
men
were
kidnapped
and
executed
in
Bandon
as
revenge
for
the
killing
of
an
IRA
officer
Michael
O'Neill
during
an
armed
raid
.


One
man
was
shot
and
survived
his
injuries
.


It
is
not
clear
who
ordered
the
attacks
or
carried
them
out
.


However
,
in
2014
the
``
Irish
Times
''
released
a
confidential
memo
from
the
then-Director
of
Intelligence
Colonel
Michael
Joe
Costello
(
later
managing
director
of
the
Irish
Sugar
Company
)
in
September
1925
in
relation
to
a
pension
claim
by
former
Irish
Republican
Army
(
IRA
)
volunteer
Daniel
O'Neill
of
Enniskean
,
County
Cork
,
stating
:
``
O'Neill
is
stated
to
be
a
very
unscrupulous
individual
and
to
have
taken
part
in
such
operations
as
lotting
[
looting
]
of
Post
Offices
,
robbing
of
Postmen
and
the
murder
of
several
Protestants
in
West
Cork
in
May
1922
.


A
brother
of
his
was
shot
dead
by
two
of
the
latter
named
,
Woods
and
Hornbrooke
[
sic
]
,
who
were
subsequently
murdered
.
''


Sinn
Féin
and
IRA
representatives
,
from
both
the
pro-Treaty
side
,
which
controlled
the
Provisional
Government
in
Dublin
and
the
anti-Treaty
side
,
which
controlled
the
area
the
killings
took
place
in
,
immediately
condemned
the
killings
.


The
motivation
of
the
killers
remains
unclear
.


It
is
generally
agreed
that
they
were
provoked
by
the
fatal
shooting
of
IRA
man
Michael
O'Neill
by
a
loyalist
whose
house
was
being
raided
on
26
April
.


Some
historians
have
claimed
there
were
sectarian
motives
;
others
claim
that
those
killed
were
targeted
only
because
they
were
suspected
of
having
been
informers
during
the
Anglo-Irish
War
,
and
argue
that
the
dead
were
associated
with
the
so-called
``
Murragh
Loyalist
Action
Group
''
,
and
that
their
names
may
have
appeared
in
captured
British
military
intelligence
files
which
listed
``
helpful
citizens
''
during
the
Anglo-Irish
War
(
1919–1921
)
,


The
Action
of
18
September
1810
was
a
naval
battle
fought
between
British
Royal
Navy
and
French
Navy
frigates
in
the
Indian
Ocean
during
the
Napoleonic
Wars
.


The
engagement
was
one
of
several
between
rival
frigate
squadrons
contesting
control
of
the
French
island
base
of
Île
de
France
,
from
which
French
frigates
had
raided
British
trade
routes
during
the
war
.


The
action
came
in
the
immediate
aftermath
of
the
Battle
of
Grand
Port
,
in
which
four
British
frigates
had
been
lost
,
and
just
four
days
after
a
fifth
British
frigate
had
been
captured
and
subsequently
recaptured
in
the
Action
of
13
September
1810
.


In
consequence
of
the
heavy
losses
the
British
force
had
suffered
,
reinforcements
were
hastily
rushed
to
the
area
and
became
individual
targets
for
the
larger
French
squadron
blockading
the
British
base
at
Île
Bourbon
.


HMS
``
Ceylon
''
had
been
despatched
by
the
British
authorities
at
Madras
after
the
Battle
of
Grand
Port
to
reinforce
the
remains
of
the
squadron
under
Commodore
Josias
Rowley
on
Île
Bourbon
.


Searching
for
Rowley
off
Île
de
France
,
``
Ceylon
''
was
spotted
by
French
Commodore
Jacques
Hamelin
who
gave
chase
in
his
flagship
``
Vénus
''
,
supported
by
a
corvette
.


``
Vénus
''
was
faster
than
``
Ceylon
''
,
and
although
Captain
Charles
Gordon
almost
reached
the
safety
of
Île
Bourbon
,
he
was
run
down
and
forced
to
engage
the
French
ship
during
the
night
,
both
frigates
inflicting
severe
damage
on
one
another
before
the
wounded
Gordon
surrendered
to
the
approaching
corvette
.


As
dawn
broke
,
Rowley
's
flagship
HMS
``
Boadicea
''
arrived
,
recaptured
``
Ceylon
''
,
drove
off
the
corvette
and
forced
the
battered
French
flagship
to
surrender
,
capturing
Hamelin
.


This
was
the
last
ship-to-ship
action
in
the
region
before
the
successful
invasion
of
Île
de
France
in
December
1810
:
without
Hamelin
the
French
squadron
,
short
on
supplies
and
low
on
morale
,
did
not
contest
British
control
of
the
region
and
failed
to
even
attempt
to
disrupt
the
invasion
fleet
.


The
Harrying
of
Buchan
,
also
known
as
the
Herschip
(
hardship
)
or
Rape
of
Buchan
,
took
place
in
1308
during
the
Wars
of
Scottish
Independence
.


It
saw
vast
areas
of
Buchan
in
northeast
Scotland
,
then
ruled
by
Clan
Comyn
,
burned
to
the
ground
by
Robert
the
Bruce
and
his
brother
Edward
,
immediately
following
their
May
1308
success
at
the
Battle
of
Barra
.


After
his
defeat
at
Barra
,
John
Comyn
,
Earl
of
Buchan
fled
to
England
.


Bruce
's
men
chased
him
as
far
as
Turriff
,
a
distance
of
sixteen
miles
(
25
km
)
.


Before
heading
south
to
lay
siege
to
Aberdeen
Castle
,
the
Bruces
laid
waste
the
Earldom
of
Buchan
,
including
all
the
castles
and
strongholds
,
principally
Rattray
Castle
and
Dundarg
Castle
.


Bruce
's
men
proceeded
to
kill
those
loyal
to
the
Comyns
,
destroying
their
homes
,
farms
,
crops
and
slaughtering
their
cattle
.


This
was
a
ruthless
exercise
by
fire
and
sword
which
even
in
an
age
of
violence
was
regarded
as
unprecedentedly
savage
.


Terrorising
the
locals
,
Bruce
prevented
any
possible
chance
of
future
violent
hostility
towards
him
and
his
men
.


The
Comyns
had
ruled
Buchan
for
nearly
a
century
,
from
1214
,
when
William
Comyn
inherited
the
title
from
his
wife
.


Such
was
the
destruction
however
,
that
the
people
of
Buchan
lost
all
loyalties
to
the
Comyns
and
never
again
rose
against
Bruce
's
supporters
.


It
took
thirty
years
before
John
Comyn
's
successor
to
the
Earldom
,
Henry
Beaumont
,
made
an
appearance
in
the
area
.


Between
1333–34
,
he
repaired
Dundarg
Castle
which
Bruce
had
destroyed
during
the
harrying
,
only
for
it
to
be
laid
siege
to
and
destroyed
by
Sir
Andrew
Murray
of
Bothwell
in
December
1336
.


Finding
little
support
,
he
left
after
the
siege
to
England
where
he
died
in
1340
.


His
son
John
refused
the
Earldom
,
ending
the
Comyn
lineage
and
the
first
creation
,
Mormaers
of
Buchan
.


The
2004
Iranian
seizure
of
Royal
Navy
personnel
took
place
in
the
Shatt
al-Arab
(
Arvand
Rud
in
Persian
)
waterway
on
21
June
.


Six
Royal
Marines
and
two
Royal
Navy
sailors
were
captured
.


The
British
servicemen
were
seized
while
training
Iraqi
river
patrol
personnel
after
Iran
said
they
had
strayed
to
the
Iranian
side
of
the
waterway
.


They
were
threatened
with
legal
action
initially
but
released
three
days
later
following
diplomatic
discussions
between
Jack
Straw
,
then
British
Foreign
Secretary
,
and
Kamal
Kharazi
,
then
Iranian
Minister
of
Foreign
Affairs
.


The
weapons
and
boats
of
the
British
personnel
were
confiscated
and
have
not
been
returned
.


They
were
released
unharmed
three
days
later
,
on
24
June
,
after
the
British
and
Iranian
governments
agreed
there
had
been
a
misunderstanding
.


Their
equipment
was
not
returned
and
a
rigid
inflatable
boat
(
RIB
)
was
put
on
display
in
a
museum
in
Tehran
.


During
their
detention
,
according
to
former
detainee
Marine
Scott
Fallon
,
they
endured
a
mock
execution
in
which
they
were
marched
into
the
desert
and
made
to
stand
blindfolded
in
front
of
a
ditch
while
their
captors
cocked
their
weapons
.


They
also
appeared
blindfolded
on
Iranian
TV
,
where
they
were
forced
to
apologise
for
their
``
mistake
''
.


The
Royal
Navy
boats
were
operating
close
to
the
northern
coast
of
the
Persian
Gulf
in
the
mouth
of
the
Shatt
al-Arab
waterway
which
divides
southern
Iran
and
Iraq
.


The
weather
was
bad
causing
negligible
visibility
which
may
have
contributed
to
a
potential
crossing
of
the
Iranian
border
by
the
Royal
Navy
.


After
the
crew
were
returned
and
events
analysed
the
British
government
affirmed
its
belief
that
the
personnel
were
actually
still
in
Iraqi
waters
,
however
they
consigned
the
incident
to
a
misunderstanding
and
requested
the
return
of
the
equipment
.


In
2015
,
an
FOIA
request
released
a
redacted
report
.


April
Sue-Lyn
Jones
(
4
April
2007
–
c.
1
October
2012
)

.


Her
disappearance
generated
a
large
amount
of
national
and
international
press
coverage
.


A
46-year-old
local
man
,
Mark
Bridger
,
was
subsequently
arrested
.


On
30
May
2013
,
Bridger
was
found
guilty
of
April
's
abduction
and
murder
,
in
addition
to
perverting
the
course
of
justice
.


He
was
sentenced

ordering
that
he
never
be

The
Annecy
shootings
,
also
the
French
Alps
shootings
or
the
Chevaline
killings
,
were
the
deaths
on
5
September
2012
of
three
members
of
a
British
family
and
a
French
citizen
on
the
``
Route
Forestière
Domaniale
de
la
Combe
d'Ire
''
near
Chevaline
,
Haute-Savoie
,
near
the
southern
end
of
Lake
Annecy
.


Four
people
were
killed
:
an
Iraqi-born
British
tourist
named
Saad
al-Hilli
,
50
;
his
wife
Iqbal
,
47
;
her
mother
Suhaila
al-Allaf
,
74
,
who
held
a
Swedish
passport
;
and
French
cyclist
Sylvain
Mollier
,
45
.


The
al-Hillis
'
two
daughters
both
survived
the
attack
.


One
,
aged
four
,
was
hidden
under
the
legs
of
her
dead
mother
in
the
rear
footwell
for
eight
hours
even
while
the
gendarmerie
were
on
the
scene
;
she
was
only
discovered
by
specialist
forensic
investigators
.


The
elder
daughter
,
aged
seven
,
was
shot
in
the
shoulder
and
also
suffered
a
head
wound
;
she
returned
to
the
United
Kingdom
on
14
September
2012
.


Police
investigated
al-Hilli
's
past
in
Iraq
as
an
engineer
on
sensitive
topics
,
as
well
as
his
work
at
the
time
of
his
death
,
as
a
potential
motive
for
the
attack
.


Al-Hilli
's
work
in
the
UK
involved
nuclear
and
satellite
technology
,
whilst
Mollier
was
also
probed
to
determine
if
he
was
the
primary
target
of
the
attack
.


The
attack
has
been
compared
to
the
1952
killing

In
September
2017
,
after
5
years
of
investigation
,
French
police
said
they
had
``
no
working
theory
''
to
explain
the
murders
and
no
suspects
.


Veronique
Dizot

The
First
Peloponnesian
War
(
460–445
BC
)
was
fought
between
Sparta
as
the
leaders
of
the
Peloponnesian
League
and
Sparta
's
other
allies
,
most
notably
Thebes
,
and
the
Delian
League
led
by
Athens
with
support
from
Argos
.


This
war
consisted
of
a
series
of
conflicts
and
minor
wars
,
such
as
the
Second
Sacred
War
.


There
were
several
causes
for
the
war
including
the
building
of
the
Athenian
long
walls
,
Megara
's
defection
and
the
envy
and
concern
felt
by
Sparta
at
the
growth
of
the
Athenian
Empire
.


The
First
Peloponnesian
War
began
in
460
BC
with
the
Battle
of
Oenoe
,
where
Spartan
forces
were
defeated
by
those
of
Athenian-Argive
alliance
.


at
first
the
athenians
had
the
better
of
the
fighting
,
winning
the
naval
engagements
using
their
superior
fleet
.


They
also
had
the
better
of
the
fighting
on
land
,
until
457
BC
when
the
Spartans
and
their
allies
defeated
the
Athenian
army
at
Tanagra
.


The
Athenians
,
however
,
counterattacked
and
scored
a
crushing
victory
over
the
Boeotians
at
the
Battle
of
Oenophyta
and
followed
this
victory
up
by
conquering
all
of
Boeotia
except
for
Thebes
.


Athens
further
consolidated
their
position
by
making
Aegina
a
member
of
the
Delian
League
and
by
ravaging
the
Peloponnese
.


The
Athenians
were
defeated
in
454
BC
by
the
Persians
in
Egypt
which
caused
them
to
enter
into
a
five
years
'
truce
with
Sparta
.


However
,
the
war
flared
up
again
in
448
BC
with
the
start
of
the
Second
Sacred
War
.


In
446
BC
,
Boeotia
revolted
and
defeated
the
Athenians
at
Coronea
and
regained
their
independence
.


The
First
Peloponnesian
War
ended
in
an
arrangement
between
Sparta
and
Athens
,
which
was
ratified
by
the
Thirty
Years
'
Peace
(
winter
of
446–445
BC
)
.


According
to
the
provisions
of
this
peace
treaty
,
both
sides
maintained
the
main
parts
of
their
empires
.


Athens
continued
its
domination
of
the
sea
while
Sparta
dominated
the
land
.


Megara
returned
to
the
Peloponnesian
League
and
Aegina
became
a
tribute-paying
but
autonomous
member
of
the
Delian
League
.


The
war
between
the
two
leagues
restarted
in
431
BC
,
leading
to
the
Second
Peloponnesian
War
.


It
ended
with
a
conclusive
Spartan
victory
,
where
,
in
404
BC
,
Athens
was
occupied
by
Sparta
.


the
russian
revolution
was
a
period
of
political
and
social
revolution
across
the
territory
of
the
russian
empire
which
started
with
the
abolishment
of
monarchy
and
concluded
with
the
establishment
of
the
soviet
union
by
the
bolsheviks
and
the
end
of
the
civil
war
.


It
began
with
the
February
Revolution
which
was
focused
around
Petrograd
(
now
Saint
Petersburg
)
,
the
capital
of
Russia
at
that
time
.


It
took
place
in
the
context
of
heavy
military
setbacks
during
the
First
World
War
,
which
left
much
of
the
Russian
Army
in
a
state
of
mutiny
.


In
the
chaos
,
members
of
the
Duma
,
Russia
's
parliament
,
assumed
control
of
the
country
,
forming
the
Russian
Provisional
Government
which
was
heavily
dominated
by
the
interests
of
large
capitalists
and
the
noble
aristocracy
.


The
army
leadership
felt
they
did
not
have
the
means
to
suppress
the
revolution
,
resulting
in
the
abdication
of
Emperor
Nicholas
II
.


Grassroots
community
assemblies
called
'Soviets
'
,
which
were
dominated
by
soldiers
and
the
urban
industrial
working
class
,
initially
permitted
the
Provisional
Government
to
rule
,
but
insisted
on
a
prerogative
to
influence
the
government
and
control
various
militias
.


A
period
of
dual
power
ensued
,
during
which
the
Provisional
Government
held
state
power
while
the
national
network
of
Soviets
,
led
by
socialists
,
had
the
allegiance
of
the
lower
classes
and
,
increasingly
,
the
left-leaning
urban
middle
class
.


During
this
chaotic
period
there
were
frequent
mutinies
,
protests
and
strikes
.


Many
socialist
political
organizations
were
engaged
in
daily
struggle
and
vied
for
influence
within
the
Duma
and
the
Soviets
,
central
among
which
were
the
Bolsheviks
(
``
Ones
of
the
Majority
''
)
led
by
Vladimir
Lenin
who
campaigned
for
an
immediate
end
to
the
war
,
land
to
the
peasants
,
and
bread
to
the
workers
.


When
the
Provisional
Government
chose
to
continue
fighting
the
war
with
Germany
,
the
Bolsheviks
and
other
socialist
factions
were
able
to
exploit
virtually
universal
disdain
towards
the
war
effort
as
justification
to
advance
the
revolution
further
.


The
Bolsheviks
turned
workers
'
militias
under
their
control
into
the
Red
Guards
(
later
the
Red
Army
)
over
which
they
exerted
substantial
control
.


The
situation
climaxed
with
the
October
Revolution
,
a
Bolshevik-led
armed
insurrection
by
workers
and
soldiers
in
Petrograd
that
successfully
overthrew
the
Provisional
Government
,
transferring
all
its
authority
to
the
Soviets
with
the
capital
being
relocated
to
Moscow
shortly
thereafter
.


The
Bolsheviks
had
secured
a
strong
base
of
support
within
the
Soviets
and
,
as
the
now
supreme
governing
party
,
established
a
federal
government
dedicated
to
reorganizing
the
former
empire
into
the
world
's
first
socialist
state
,
practicing
Soviet
democracy
on
a
national
and
international
scale
.


the
promise
to
end
russia
's
participation
in
the
first
world
war
was
honored
promptly
with
the
bolshevik
leaders
signing
the
treaty
of
brest-litovsk
with
germany
in
march
1918
.


to
further
secure
the
new
state
,
the
cheka
was
established
which
functioned
as
a
revolutionary
security
service
that
sought
to
weed
out
and
punish
those
considered
to
be
``
enemies
of
the
people
''
in
campaigns
consciously
modeled
on
similar
events
during
the
french
revolution
.


Soon
after
,
civil
war
erupted
among
the
``
Reds
''
(
Bolsheviks
)
,
the
``
Whites
''
(
counter-revolutionaries
)
,
the
independence
movements
and
other
socialist
factions
opposed
to
the
Bolsheviks
.


it
continued
for
several
years
,
during
which
the
bolsheviks
defeated
both
the
whites
and
all
rival
socialists
and
thereafter
reconstituted
themselves
as
the
communist
party
.


Soviet
power
was
established
in
the
newly
independent
republics
of
Armenia
,
Azerbaijan
,
Belarus
,
Georgia
and
Ukraine
which
led
to
their
unification
into
the
Union
of
Soviet
Socialist
Republics
(
USSR
)
in
1922
.


While
many
notable
historical
events
occurred
in
Moscow
and
Petrograd
,
there
was
also
a
visible
movement
in
cities
throughout
the
state
,
among
national
minorities
throughout
the
empire
and
in
the
rural
areas
,
where
peasants
took
over
and
redistributed
land
.


The
Irish
Civil
War
(
;
28
June
1922
–
24
May
1923
)
was
a
conflict
that
followed
the
Irish
War
of
Independence
and
accompanied
the
establishment
of
the
Irish
Free
State
,
an
entity
independent
from
the
United
Kingdom
but
within
the
British
Empire
.


the
civil
war
was
waged
between
two
opposing
groups
,
the
pro-treaty
provisional
government
and
the
anti-treaty
ira
,
over
the
anglo-irish
treaty
.


the
forces
of
the
provisional
government
(
which
became
the
free
state
in
december
1922
)
supported
the
treaty
,
while
the
republican
opposition
saw
it
as
a
betrayal
of
the
irish
republic
(
which
had
been
proclaimed
during
the
easter
rising
)
.


Many
of
those
who
fought
on
both
sides
in
the
conflict
had
been
members
of
the
Irish
Republican
Army
(
IRA
)
during
the
War
of
Independence
.


The
Civil
War
was
won
by
the
Free
State
forces
,
who
benefitted
from
substantial
quantities
of
weapons
provided
by
the
British
Government
.


The
conflict
may
have
claimed
more
lives
than
the
War
of
Independence
that
preceded
it
,
and
left
Irish
society
divided
and
embittered
for
generations
.


Today
,
two
of
the
main
political
parties
in
the
Republic
of
Ireland
,
Fianna
Fáil
and
Fine
Gael
,
are
direct
descendants
of
the
opposing
sides
of
the
war
.


operation
deny
flight
was
a
north
atlantic
treaty
organization
(
nato
)
operation
that
began
on
12
april
1993
as
the
enforcement
of
a
united
nations
(
un
)
no-fly
zone
over
bosnia
and
herzegovina
.


The
United
Nations
and
NATO
later
expanded
the
mission
of
the
operation
to
include
providing
close
air
support
for
UN
troops
in
Bosnia
and
carrying
out
coercive
air
strikes
against
targets
in
Bosnia
.


Twelve
NATO
members
contributed
forces
to
the
operation
and
,
by
its
end
on
20
December
1995
,
NATO
pilots
had
flown
100,420
sorties
.


The
operation
played
an
important
role
in
shaping
both
the
Bosnian
War
and
NATO
.


The
operation
included
the
first
combat
engagement
in
NATO
's
history
,
a
28
February
1994
air
battle
over
Banja
Luka
,
and
in
April
1994
,
NATO
aircraft
first
bombed
ground
targets
in
an
operation
near
Goražde
.


These
engagements
helped
show
that
NATO
had
adapted
to
the
post-Cold
War
era
and
could
operate
in
environments
other
than
a
major
force
on
force
engagement
on
the
plains
of
Central
Europe
.


Cooperation
between
the
UN
and
NATO
during
the
operation
also
helped
pave
the
way
for
future
joint
operations
.


although
it
helped
establish
unk
relations
,
deny
flight
led
to
conflict
between
the
two
organizations
.


Most
notably
,
significant
tension
arose
between
the
two
after
UN
peacekeepers
were
taken
as
hostages
in
response
to
NATO
bombing
.


The
operations
of
Deny
Flight
spanned
more
than
two
years
of
the
Bosnian
War
and
played
an
important
role
in
the
course
of
that
conflict
.


The
no-fly
zone
operations
of
Deny
Flight
proved
successful
in
preventing
significant
use
of
air
power
by
any
side
in
the
conflict
.


additionally
,
the
air
strikes
flown
during
deny
flight
led
to
operation
deliberate
force
,
a
massive
nato
bombing
campaign
in
bosnia
that
played
a
key
role
in
ending
the
war
.


The
Abkhaz–Georgian
conflict
involves
ethnic
conflict
between
Georgians
and
the
Abkhaz
people
in
Abkhazia
,
a
``
de
facto
''
independent
,
partially
recognized
republic
.


In
a
broader
sense
,
one
can
view
the
Georgian–Abkhaz
conflict
as
part
of
a
geopolitical
conflict
in
the
Caucasus
region
,
intensified
at
the
end
of
the
20th
century
with
the
dissolution
of
the
Soviet
Union
in
1991
.


The
conflict
,
one
of
the
bloodiest
in
the
post-Soviet
area
,
remains
unresolved
.


The
Georgian
government
has
offered
substantial
autonomy
to
Abkhazia
several
times
.


However
,
both
the
Abkhaz
government
and
the
opposition
in
Abkhazia
refuse
any
form
of
union
with
Georgia
.


Abkhaz
regard
their
independence
as
the
result
of
a
war
of
liberation
from
Georgia
,
while
Georgians
believe
that
historically
Abkhazia
has
always
formed
part
of
Georgia
.


Georgians
formed
the
single
largest
ethnic
group
in
pre-war
Abkhazia
,
with
a
45.7
%
plurality
as
of
1989
but
most
Georgians
left
in
Abkhazia
want
to
remain
independent
of
Georgia
.


Many
accuse
the
government
of
Eduard
Shevardnadze
(
in
office
1992-2003
)
of
the
initiation
of
senseless
hostilities
,
and
then
of
ineffective
conduct
of
the
war
and
post-war
diplomacy
.


During
the
war
the
Abkhaz
separatist
side
carried
out
an
ethnic
cleansing
campaign
which
resulted
in
the
expulsion
of
up
to
250,000
ethnic
Georgians
and
in
the
killing
of
from
4,000
to
15,000
.


the
organization
for
security
and
co-operation
in
europe
(
osce
)
conventions
of
lisbon
,
budapest
and
istanbul
have
officially
recognized
the
ethnic
cleansing
of
georgians
,
which
un
general
assembly
resolution
unk
also
mentions
.


The
UN
Security
Council
has
passed
a
series
of
resolutions
in

The
Crimean
War
(
;
or
;
;
)
was
a
military
conflict
fought
from
October
1853
to
February
1856
in
which
the
Russian
Empire
lost
to
an
alliance
of
the
Ottoman
Empire
,
France
,
Britain
and
Sardinia
.


The
immediate
cause
involved
the
rights
of
Christian
minorities
in
the
Holy
Land
,
which
was
a
part
of
the
Ottoman
Empire
.


The
French
promoted
the
rights
of
Roman
Catholics
,
while
Russia
promoted
those
of
the
Eastern
Orthodox
Church
.


The
longer-term
causes
involved
the
decline
of
the
Ottoman
Empire
and
the
unwillingness
of
Britain
and
France
to
allow
Russia
to
gain
territory
and
power
at
Ottoman
expense
.


It
has
widely
been
noted
that
the
causes
,
in
one
case
involving
an
argument
over
a
key
,
have
never
revealed
a
``
greater
confusion
of
purpose
''
,
yet
they
led
to
a
war
noted
for
its
``
notoriously
incompetent
international
butchery
''
.


While
the
churches
worked
out
their
differences
and
came
to
an
agreement
,
Nicholas
I
of
Russia
and
the
French
Emperor
Napoleon
III
refused
to
back
down
.


Nicholas
issued
an
ultimatum
that
the
Orthodox
subjects
of
the
Ottoman
Empire
be
placed
under
his
protection
.


Britain
attempted
to
mediate
and
arranged
a
compromise
that
Nicholas
agreed
to
.


When
the
Ottomans
demanded
changes
,
Nicholas
refused
and
prepared
for
war
.


Having
obtained
promises
of
support
from
France
and
Britain
,
the
Ottomans
declared
war
on
Russia
in
October
1853
.


The
war
started
in
the
Balkans
in
July
1853
,
when
Russian
troops
occupied
the
Danubian
Principalities
(
now
part
of
Romania
)
,
which
were
under
Ottoman
suzerainty
,
then
began
to
cross
the
Danube
.


Led
by
Omar
Pasha
,
the
Ottomans
fought
a
strong
defensive
campaign
and
stopped
the
advance
at
Silistra
.


A
separate
action
on
the
fort
town
of
Kars
in
eastern
Anatolia
led
to
a
siege
,
and
a
Turkish
attempt
to
reinforce
the
garrison
was
destroyed
by
a
Russian
fleet
at
Sinop
.


Fearing
an
Ottoman
collapse
,
France
and
Britain
rushed
forces
to
Gallipoli
.


They
then
moved
north
to
Varna
in
June
1854
,
arriving
just
in
time
for
the
Russians
to
abandon
Silistra
.


Aside
from
a
minor
skirmish
at
Köstence
(
today
Constanța
)
,
there
was
little
for
the
allies
to
do
.


Karl
Marx
quipped
,
``
there
they
are
,
the
French
doing
nothing
and
the
British
helping
them
as
fast
as
possible
''
.


Frustrated
by
the
wasted
effort
,
and
with
demands
for
action
from
their
citizens
,
the
allied
force
decided
to
attack
Russia
's
main
naval
base
in
the
Black
Sea
at
Sevastopol
on
the
Crimean
peninsula
.


After
extended
preparations
,
the
forces
landed
on
the
peninsula
in
September
1854
and
marched
their
way
to
a
point
south
of
Sevastopol
after
the
successful
Battle
of
the
Alma
.


The
Russians
counterattacked
on
25
October
in
what
became
the
Battle
of
Balaclava
and
were
repulsed
,
but
at
the
cost
of
seriously
depleting
the
British
Army
forces
.


A
second
counterattack
,
at
Inkerman
,
ended
in
stalemate
.


The
front
settled
into
a
siege
and
led
to
brutal
conditions
for
troops
on
both
sides
.


Smaller
military
actions
took
place
in
the
Baltic
,
the
Caucasus
,
the
White
Sea
,
and
the
North
Pacific
.


Sevastopol
fell
after
eleven
months
,
and
neutral
countries
began
to
join
the
Allied
cause
.


Isolated
and
facing
a
bleak
prospect
of
invasion
from
the
west
if
the
war
continued
,
Russia
sued
for
peace
in
March
1856
.


France
and
Britain
welcomed
this
development
,
as
the
conflict
was
growing

the
treaty
of
paris
,
signed
on
30
march
1856
,
ended
the
war
.


It
forbade
Russia
from
basing
warships
in
the
Black
Sea
.


The
Ottoman
vassal
states
of
Wallachia
and
Moldavia
became
largely

Christians

The
Crimean
War
was
one
of
the
first
conflicts
in
which
the
military
used
modern
technologies
such
as
explosive
naval
shells
,
railways
,
and
telegraphs
.


The
war
was
one
of
the
first
to
be
documented
extensively
in
written
reports
and
photographs
.


As
the
legend
of
the
``
Charge
of
the
Light
Brigade
''
demonstrates
,
the
war
quickly
became
an
iconic
symbol
of
logistical
,
medical
and
tactical
failures
and
mismanagement
.


The
reaction
in
Britain
was
a
demand
for
professionalisation
,
most
famously
achieved
by
Florence
Nightingale
,
who
gained
worldwide
attention
for
pioneering
modern
nursing
while
treating
the
wounded
.


The
Crimean
War
proved
to
be
the
moment
of
truth
for
Nikolaevan
Russia
.


The
humiliation
forced
Russia
's
educated
elites
to
identify
the
Empire
's
problems
and
to
recognize
the
need
for
fundamental
transformations
aimed
at
modernizing
and
restoring
Russia
's
position
in
the
ranks
of
European
powers
.


Historians
have
studied
the
role
of
the
Crimean
War
as
a
catalyst
for
the
reforms
of
Russia
's
social
institutions
:
serfdom
,
justice
,
local
self-government
,
education
,
and
military
service
.


More
recently
,
scholars
have
also
turned
their
attention
to
the
impact
of
the
Crimean
War
on
the
development

Russian
nationalistic

Tropical
Cyclone
Alan
was
considered
to
be
one
of
the
worst
natural
disasters
experienced
in
French
Polynesia
.


The
system
,
first
noted
as
a
tropical
disturbance
on
April
17
,
1998
east
of
the
Northern
Cook
Islands
,
initially
moved
erratically
prior
to
its
designation
as
Alan
upon
developing
into
a
tropical
cyclone
on
April
21
.


The
following
day
,
Alan
reached
its
estimated
peak
intensity
with
10-minute
maximum
sustained
wind
speeds
of
,
posing
several
forecasting
challenges
due
to
difficulties
in
establishing
its
location
and
intensity
.


On
April
23
,
Alan
appeared
to
become
sheared
with
the
low-level
circulation
center
displaced
about
from
the
nearest
atmospheric
convection
.


However
,
over
the
next
day
,
after
the
mid-level
trough
of
low
pressure
shearing
the
system
moved
faster
than
expected
,
Alan
became
better
organized
.


While
situated
about
west-northwest
of
the
French
Polynesian
island
of
Tahiti
,
the
system
drifted
south-southeastward
.


Early
on
April
25
,
Alan
passed
near
to
or
over
the
French
Polynesian
Society
Islands
of
Maupiti
,
Bora-Bora
,
and
Raiatea
.


However
,
strong
wind
shear
pulled
the
system
apart
,
with
visible
imagery
confirming
the
system
's
degeneration
into
a
depression
with
a
fully
exposed
low-level
circulation
.


The
system
affected
French
Polynesia
with
high
winds
and
torrential
rain
,
causing
several
landslides
on
the
Society
Islands
.


The
landslides
resulted
in
the
collapse
of
two
bridges
,
and
also
overturned
trees
,
in
turn
obstructing
roads
.


Overall
,
ten
people
died
as
a
result
of
the
system
,
while
thirty
others
were
injured
,
with
a
majority
of
the
casualties
a
result
of
landslides
.


On
the
islands
of
Raiatea
,
Taha
'
a
and
Huahine
,
several
churches
,
schools
and
clinics
were
damaged
,
while
water
and
electricity
supplies
were
cut
off
.


On
the
islands
,
around
750
houses
were
destroyed
,
with
430
and
150
wrecked
on
Huahine
and
Ra'iātea
,
respectively
.


Osama
bin
Laden
,
the
founder
and
first
leader
of
the
Islamist
terrorist
group
,
Al-Qaeda
,
was
killed
in
Pakistan
on
May
2
,
2011
,
shortly
after
1:00
am
PKT
(
20:00
UTC

)
by
United
States
Navy
SEALs
of
the
U.S
.


Naval
Special
Warfare
Development
Group
(
also
known
as
DEVGRU
or
SEAL
Team
Six
)
.


the
operation
,
code-named
operation
neptune
spear
,
was
carried
out
in
a
unk
operation
with
joint
special
operations
command
,
commonly
known
as
jsoc
,
coordinating
the
special
mission
units
involved
in
the
raid
.


In
addition
to
SEAL
Team
Six
,
participating
units
under
JSOC
included
the
160th
Special
Operations
Aviation
Regiment
(
Airborne
)
—also
known
as
``
Night
Stalkers
''
—and
operators
from
the
CIA
's
Special
Activities
Division
,
which
recruits
heavily
from
former
JSOC
Special
Mission
Units
.


The
operation
ended
a
nearly
10-year
search
for
bin
Laden
,
following
his
role
in
the
September
11
attacks
on
the
United
States
.


The
raid
on
bin
Laden
's
compound
in
Abbottabad
,
Pakistan
was
launched
from
Afghanistan
.


U.S.
military
officials
said
that
after
the
raid
U.S.
forces
took
the
body
of
bin
Laden
to
Afghanistan
for
identification
,
then
buried
it
at
sea
within
24
hours
of
his
death
in
accordance
with
Islamic
tradition
.


Al-Qaeda
confirmed
the
death
on
May
6
with
posts
made
on
militant
websites
,
vowing
to
avenge
the
killing
.


Other
Pakistani
militant
groups
,
including
the
Tehrik-i-Taliban
Pakistan
,
vowed
retaliation
against
the
U.S.
and
against
Pakistan
for
not
preventing
the
operation
.


The
raid
was
supported
by
over
90
%
of
the
American
public
,
was
welcomed
by
the
United
Nations
,
NATO
,
the
European
Union
and
a
large
number
of
governments
,
but
was
condemned
by
others
,
including
two-thirds
of
the
Pakistani
public
.


Legal
and
ethical
aspects
of
the
killing
,
such
as
his
not
being
taken
alive
despite
being
unarmed
,
were
questioned
by
others
,
including
Amnesty
International
.


Also
controversial
was
the
decision
not
to
release
any
photographic
or
DNA
evidence
of
bin
Laden
's
death
to
the
public
.


In
the
aftermath
of
the
killing
,
Pakistani
Prime
Minister
Yousaf
Raza
Gillani
formed
a
commission
under
Senior
Justice
Javed
Iqbal
to
investigate
the
circumstances
surrounding
the
attack
.


the
resulting
abbottabad
commission
report
,
which
revealed
pakistani
state
military
and
intelligence
authorities
'
``
collective
failure
''
that
enabled
bin
laden
to
hide
in
pakistan
for
nine
years
,
was
leaked
to
al
jazeera
on
july
8
,
2013
.


The
Action
of
31
July
1793
was
an
inconclusive
engagement
between
a
British
Royal
Navy
frigate
and
French
frigate
off
the
New
Jersey
coastline
in
the
first
year
of
the
French
Revolutionary
Wars
.


The
British
captain
,
George
Courtenay
of
HMS
``
Boston
''
,
had
arrived
off
New
York
City
on
28
May
and
deliberately
disguised
his
ship
as
a
French
vessel
,
fooling
a
French
officer
into
coming
aboard
and
making
him
a
prisoner
of
war
.


Courtenay
then
sent
a
message
into
New
York
,
where
he
knew
a
French
frigate
lay
at
anchor
,
challenging
the
French
captain
to
battle
within
the
next
three
days
.


The
challenge
was
accepted
and
widely
disseminated
throughout
the
city
,
so
that
when
Captain
Jean-Baptiste-François
Bompart
of
``
Embuscade
''
sailed
out
to
meet
Courtenay
on
the
morning
of
31
July
,
the
shore
was
crowded
with
thousands
of
sightseers
.


The
engagement
between
the
ships
was
fiercely
contested
,
but
the
smaller
and
more
lightly
armed
``
Boston
''
seemed
to
be
taking
the
more
serious
damage
when
at
6:20
Captain
Courtenay
was
thrown
to
the
deck
.


What
happened
next
has
been
subject
to
debate
,
with
the
second-in-command
,
Lieutenant
John
Edwards
claiming
that
Courtenay
had
been
killed
and
he
was
thrown
overboard
as
was
the
custom
at
the
time
.


However
rumours
subsequently
circulated
that
Courtenay
had
only
been
knocked
unconscious
when
Edwards
gave
the
order
to
jettison
him
,
a
story
that
his
family
credited
and
was
later
taken
up
by
the
contemporary
historian
Edward
Pelham
Brenton
,
although
historian
William
James
subsequently
defended
Edwards
'
actions
.


With
Courtenay
gone
,
``
Boston
''
continued
to
suffer
severe
damage
until
just
after
07:00
,
when
the
remaining
officers
ordered
all
surviving
sails
set
and
the
British
ship
attempted
to
escape
.


although
bompart
pursued
,
by
08:00
the
strain
had
proved
too
much
for
his
ship
and
he
fell
back
.


After
a
close
encounter
with
French
ships
in
the
Delaware
River
,
``
Boston
''
eventually
escaped
to
St
John
's
,
Newfoundland
while
``
Embuscade
''
refitted
in
New
York
.


The
King
David
Hotel
bombing
was
a
terrorist
attack
carried
out
on
Monday
,
July
22
,
1946
,
by
the
militant
right-wing
Zionist
underground
organization
the
Irgun
on
the
British
administrative
headquarters
for
Palestine
,
which
was
housed
in
the
southern
wing
of
the
King
David
Hotel
in
Jerusalem
during
the
Jewish
insurgency
in
Mandatory
Palestine
.


91
people
of
various
nationalities
were
killed
,
and
46
were
injured
.


the
hotel
was
the
site
of
the
central
offices
of
the
british
mandatory
authorities
of
palestine
,
principally
the
secretariat
of
the
government
of
palestine
and
the
headquarters
of
the
british
armed
forces
in
palestine
and
transjordan
.


When
planned
,
the
attack
had
the
approval
of
the
Haganah
,
the
principal
Jewish
paramilitary
group
in
Palestine
,
though
,
unbeknownst
to
the
Irgun
,
this
had
been
cancelled
by
the
time
the
operation
was
carried
out
.


It
was
conceived
as
part
of
a
response
to
Operation
Agatha
(
a
series
of
widespread
raids
,
including
one
on
the
Jewish
Agency
,
conducted
by
the
British
authorities
)
and
was
the
deadliest
directed
at
the
British
during
the
Mandate
era
(
1920–1948
)
.


Disguised
as
Arab
workmen
and
as
hotel
waiters
,
members
of
the
Irgun
planted
a
bomb
in
the
basement
of
the
main
building
of
the
hotel
,
whose
southern
wing
housed
the
Mandate
Secretariat
and
a
few
offices
of
the
British
military
headquarters
.


The
resulting
explosion
caused
the
collapse
of
the
western
half
of
the
southern
wing
of
the
hotel
.


Some
of
the
inflicted
deaths
and
injuries
occurred
in
the
road
outside
the
hotel
and
in
adjacent
buildings
.


The
Irgun
sent
warnings
by
telephone
,
including
one
to
the
hotel
's
own
switchboard
,
which
,
possibly
because
hoax
bomb
warnings
were
rife
at
the
time
,
the
staff
decided
to
ignore
,
but
none
directly
to
the
British
authorities
.


From
the
fact
that
a
bomb
search
had
already
been
carried
out
,
it
appears
that
a
hoax
call
or
tip-off
had
been
received
at
the
hotel
earlier
that
day
.


Subsequent
telephone
calls
from
a
concerned
``
Palestine
Post
''
staff
member
and
the
police
caused
increasing
alarm
,
and
the
hotel
manager
was
notified
.


In
the
closing
minutes
before
the
explosion
,
he
called
an
unknown
British
officer
,
but
no
evacuation
was
ordered
.


Controversy
has
arisen
over
the
timing
and
adequacy
of
the
warnings
,
and
the
reasons
why
,
given
that
warnings
were
made
,
the
hotel
was
not
evacuated
.


Typhoon
Ma-on
,
known
in
the
Philippines
as
Typhoon
Ineng
,
was
a
large
and
powerful
typhoon
that
affected
southern
Japan
in
July
2011
.


It
was
the
sixth
named
storm
and
second
typhoon
of
the
2011
Pacific
typhoon
season
.


Originating
from
an
area
of
low
pressure
near
Wake
Island
on
July
9
,
the
precursor
to
Ma-on
gradually
developed
as
it
moved
westward
.


By
July
11
,
it
had
become
sufficiently
organized
to
be
declared
a
tropical
depression
,
although
the
cyclone
's
circulation
remained
broad
.


over
the
following
days
,
unk
gradually
intensified
and
attained
typhoon
status
on
july
14
.


Favorable
environmental
conditions
allowed
for
additional
strengthening
,
and
the
storm
ultimately
attained
peak
ten-minute
sustained
winds
of
175
km/h
(
110
mph
)
on
July
16
.


After
turning
northward
in
response
to
a
weakening
subtropical
ridge
,
the
typhoon
underwent
a
series
of
eyewall
replacement
cycles
that
caused
it
to
weaken
.


On
July
19
,
Ma-on
struck
Shikoku
before
turning
southeastward
and
moving
back
over
water
.


Slow
weakening
continued
as
Ma-on
succumbed
to
the
effects
of
high
wind
shear
.


The
system
ultimately
became
extratropical
on
July
24
,
and
was
last
noted
by
the
Japan
Meteorological
Agency
a
week
later
near
the
Kamchatka
Peninsula
.


Initially
,
Ma-on
posed
a
slight
threat
to
the
Mariana
Islands
and
prompted
the
issuance
of
tropical
storm
warnings
.


However
,
the
system
remained
far
away
from
the
area
and
only
produced
scattered
rainfall
.


In
Japan
,
hundreds
of
people
evacuated
from
mudslide-prone
areas
.


Torrential
rains
produced
by
the
storm
,
estimated
at
more
than
1,200
mm
(
48
in
)
,
led
to
widespread
and
damaging
floods
.


Five
people
perished
as
a
result
of
Ma-on
,
and
damage
reached
¥3.9
billion
(
2011
JPY
,
$
50
million
2011
USD
)
.

Leeds
''
for
promotional
purposes
.


In
November
2007
the
sponsored
title
was
abolished
after
nine
years
and
the
Reading
Festival
reclaimed
its
original
name
.


In
2011
,
the
capacity
of
the
Reading
site
was
87,000

and
teachers
at
a
Jewish
school
.


Seven
people
were
killed
and
five
wounded
.


On
11
March
,
Merah
shot
dead
an
off-duty
French
Army
paratrooper
in
Toulouse
.


On
15
March
,
he
killed
two
off-duty
uniformed
French
soldiers
and
seriously
wounded
another
in
Montauban
.


On
19
March
,
he
opened
fire
at
the
Ozar
Hatorah
Jewish
day
school
in
Toulouse
,
killing
a
rabbi
and
three
children
,
also
wounding
four
others
.


Merah
filmed
his
attacks
with
a
body-worn
camera
.


Thereafter
,
France
raised
its
``
Vigipirate
,
''
the
terror
alert
system
,
to
the
highest
level
in
the
Midi-Pyrénées
region
and
surrounding
departements
.


The
United
Nations
,
many
governments
around
the
world
and
the
French
Council
of
the
Muslim
Faith
condemned
the
attacks
.


The
gunman
,
Mohammed
Merah
,
was
a
23-year-old
French
petty
criminal
of
Algerian
descent
who
was
born
and
raised
in
Toulouse
.


He
claimed
allegiance
to
Al-Qaeda
and
said
he
carried
out
his
attacks
because
of
France
's
participation
in
the
War
in
Afghanistan
and
its
ban
on
Islamic
face
veils
,
and
justified
his
attack
on
the
Jewish
school
because
``
The
Jews
kill
our
brothers
and
sisters
in
Palestine
''
.


He
was
killed
on
22
March
by
a
police
tactical
unit
after
a
30-hour
siege
at
his
rented
apartment
there
,
during
which
he
wounded
six
agents
.


His
brother
and
another
man
were
later
convicted
of
taking
part
in
a
``
terrorist
conspiracy
''
over
the
attacks

The
Spanish
Armada
(
)
was
a
Habsburg
Spanish
fleet
of
130
ships
that
sailed
from
Corunna
in
late
May
1588
,
under
the
command
of
the
Duke
of
Medina
Sidonia
,
with
the
purpose
of
escorting
an
army
from
Flanders
to
invade
England
.


Medina
Sidonia
was
an
aristocrat
without
naval
command
experience
but
was
made
commander
by
King
Philip
II
.


The
aim
was
to
overthrow
Queen
Elizabeth
I
and
her
establishment
of
Protestantism
in
England
,
to
stop
English
interference
in
the
Spanish
Netherlands
and
to
stop
the
harm
caused
by
English
and
Dutch
privateering
ships
that
interfered
with
Spanish
interests
in
the
Americas
.


English
ships
sailed
from
Plymouth
to
attack
the
Armada
and
were
faster
and
more
manoeuvrable
than
the
larger
Spanish
Galleons
,
enabling
them
to
fire
on
the
Armada
without
loss
as
it
sailed
east
off
the
south
coast
of
England
.


The
Armada
could
have
anchored
in
The
Solent
between
the
Isle
of
Wight
and
the
English
mainland
and
occupied
the
Isle
of
Wight
,
but
Medina
Sidonia
was
under
orders
from
King
Philip
II
to
meet
up
with
the
Duke
of
Parma
's
forces
in
the
Netherlands
so
England
could
be
invaded
by
Parma
's
soldiers
and
other
soldiers
carried
in
ships
of
the
Armada
.


English
guns
damaged
the
Armada
and
a
Spanish
ship
was
captured
by
Sir
Francis
Drake
in
the
English
Channel
.


The
Armada
anchored
off
Calais
.


While
awaiting
communications
from
Duke
of
Parma
,
the
Armada
was
scattered
by
an
English
fireship
night
attack
and
abandoned
its
rendezvous
with
Parma
's
army
,
that
was
blockaded
in
harbour
by
Dutch
flyboats
.


In
the
ensuing
Battle
of
Gravelines
,
the
Spanish
fleet
was
further
damaged
and
was
in
risk
of
running
aground
on
the
Dutch
coast
when
the
wind
changed
.


The
Armada
,
driven
by
southwest
winds
,
withdrew
north
,
with
the
English
fleet
harrying
it
up
the
east
coast
of
England
.


On
return
to
Spain
round
the
north
of
Scotland
and
south
around
Ireland
,
the
Armada
was
disrupted
further
by
storms
.


A
large
number
of
ships
were
wrecked
on
the
coasts
of
Scotland
and
Ireland
and
more
than
a
third
of
the
initial
130
ships
failed
to
return
.


As
Martin
and
Parker
explain
,
``
Philip
II
attempted
to
invade
England
,
but
his
plans
miscarried
.


This
was
due
to
his
own
mismanagement
,
including
appointing
an
aristocrat
without
naval
experience
as
commander
of
the
Armada
,
unfortunate
weather
,
and
the
opposition
of
the
English
and
their
Dutch
allies
including
the
use
of
fire-ships
sailed
into
the
anchored
Armada
.
''


The
expedition
was
the
largest
engagement
of
the
undeclared
Anglo-Spanish
War
(
1585–1604
)
.


The
following
year
,
England
organised
a
similar
large-scale
campaign
against
Spain
,
the
English
Armada
,
sometimes
called
the
``
counter-Armada
of
1589
''
.


the
defense
of
van
(
also
known
as
the
siege
of
van
or
van
resistance
to
the
armenians
(
``
vani
unk
''
)
was
a
battle
between
forces
of
the
ottoman
army
against
the
inhabitants
of
the
strategically
located
city
of
van
.


The
resistance
broke
out
during
the
Caucasus
Campaign
,
in
which
the
Dashnak
militias
were
supported
by
the
Imperial
Russian
army
to
oppose
the
Ottomans
.


Such
measures
had
not
been
intended
or
planned
by
the
Armenians
.


Several
contemporaneous
observers
and
later
historians
have
concluded
that
the
Ottoman
government
deliberately
instigated
the
armed
Armenian
resistance
by
enforcing
the
conditions
on
their
subjects
and
then
used
this
insurgency
as
a
main
pretext
to
justify
the
forced
deportations
of
Armenians
from
all
over
the
empire
.


However
,
the
decisions
of
deportation
and
extermination
were
made
before
the
Van
resistance
.


The
assessment
of
witness
reports
maintained
that
the
Armenian
posture
at
Van
was
defensive
and
an
act
of
resistance
to
massacre
.


Based
mostly
in
the
city
of
Van
,
it
was
one
of
the
few
successful
instances
during
the
Armenian
Genocide
when
Armenians
fought
against
the
Ottoman
Empire
's
armed
forces
.


The
Prague
uprising
(
)
of
1945
was
a
partially-successful
attempt
by
the
Czech
resistance
to
liberate
the
city
of
Prague
from
German
occupation
during
World
War
II
.


The
preceding
six
years
of
occupation
had
fuelled
anti-German
sentiment
and
the
approach
of
the
Soviet
Red
Army
and
the
US
Third
Army
offered
a
chance
of
success
.


On
5
May
1945
,
in
the
last
moments
of
the
war
in
Europe
,
Czech
citizens
spontaneously
attacked
the
German
occupiers
and
Czech
resistance
leaders
emerged
from
hiding
to
join
the
uprising
.


The
Russian
Liberation
Army
,
which
had
been
fighting
for
the
Germans
,
defected
and
supported
the
Czechs
.


German
troops
counter-attacked
,
but
their
progress
was
slowed
by
barricades
constructed
by
the
Czech
citizenry
.


On
8
May
,
the
Czech
and
German
leaders
signed
a
ceasefire
allowing
the
German
forces
to
withdraw
from
the
city
,
but
not
all
Waffen-SS
units
obeyed
.


Fighting
continued
until
9
May
,
when
the
Red
Army
entered
the
nearly
liberated
city
.


The
uprising
was
brutal
,
with
both
sides
committing
war
crimes
.


Violence
against
Germans
,
sanctioned
by
the
Czechoslovak
government
,
continued
after
the
liberation
,
and
was
justified
as
revenge
for
the
occupation
or
as
a
means
to
encourage
Germans
to
flee
.


George
Patton
’
s
US
Third
Army
was
ordered
by
General
Dwight
Eisenhower
not
to
come
to
the
aid
of
the
Czech
insurgents
,
which
undermined
the
credibility
of
the
Western
powers
in
postwar
Czechoslovakia
.


instead
,
the
uprising
was
presented
as
a
symbol
of
czech
resistance
to
nazi
rule
,
and
the
liberation
by
the
red
army
was
exploited
by
the
czechoslovak
communist
party
to
increase
popular
support
for
communism
.


The
Louisiana
Renaissance
Festival
(
abbreviated
LARF
)
is
a

the
romanian
revolution
(
)
was
a
period
of
violent
civil
unrest
in
romania
during
december
1989
as
a
part
of
the
revolutions
of
1989
that
occurred
in
several
countries
.


the
romanian
revolution
started
in
the
city
of
UNK
and
soon
spread
throughout
the
country
,
ultimately
culminating
in
the
show
trial
and
execution
of
longtime
communist
party
general
secretary
nicolae
UNK
and
his
wife
elena
,
and
the
end
of
42
years
of
communist
rule
in
romania
.


It
was
also
the
last
removal
of
a
Marxist-Leninist
government
in
a
Warsaw
Pact
country
during
the
events
of
1989
,
and
the
only
one
that
violently
overthrew
a
country
's
government
and
executed
its
leader
.


Early
protests
occurred
in
the
city
of
Timișoara
in
mid-December
on
the
part
of
the
Hungarian
minority
in
response
to
an
attempt
by
the
government
to
evict
Hungarian
Reformed
church
pastor
László
Tőkés
.


In
response
,
Romanians
sought
revolution
and
a
change
in
government
in
light
of
similar
recent
events
in
neighbouring
nations
.


The
country
's
ubiquitous
secret
police
force
,
the
Securitate
,
which
was
both
one
of
the
largest
in
the
Eastern
Bloc
and
for
decades
had
been
the
main
suppressor
of
popular
dissension
,
frequently
and
violently
quashing
political
disagreement
,
ultimately
proved
incapable
of
stopping
the
looming
,
and
then
highly
fatal
and
successful
revolt
.


Social
and
economic
malaise
had
been
present
in
socialist
Romania
for
quite
some
time
,
especially
during
the
austerity
years
of
the
1980s
.


The
austerity
measures
were
designed
in
part
by
Ceaușescu
to
repay
foreign
debts
.


Shortly
after
a
botched
public
speech
by
Ceaușescu
in
Bucharest
(
Romania
's
capital
city
)
that
was
broadcast
to
millions
of
Romanians
on
state
television
,
rank-and-file
members
of
the
military
switched
,
almost
unanimously
,
from
supporting
the
dictator
to
backing
the
protesting
population
.


Riots
,
street
violence
and
murder
in
several
Romanian
cities
over
the
course
of
roughly
a
week
led
the
Romanian
leader
to
flee
the
capital
city
on
22
December
with
his
wife
,
Deputy
Prime
Minister
Elena
Ceaușescu
.


Evading
capture
by
hastily
departing
via
helicopter
effectively
portrayed
the
couple
as
both
fugitives
and
also
acutely
guilty
of
accused
crimes
.


Captured
in
Târgoviște
,
they
were
tried
by
a
drumhead
military
tribunal
on
charges
of
genocide
,
damage
to
the
national
economy
and
abuse
of
power
to
execute
military
actions
against
the
Romanian
people
.


They
were
convicted
on
all
charges
,
sentenced
to
death
,
and
immediately
executed
on
Christmas
Day
1989
,
and
to
this
day
,
are
the
last
people
to
be
condemned
to
death
and
executed
in
Romania
.


Present-day
Romania
has
unfolded
in
the
shadow
of
the
Ceaușescus
along
with
its
communist
past
,
and
the
tumultuous
departure
from
it
.


The
National
Salvation
Front
quickly
took
power
after
Ceaușescu
was
toppled
,
promising
free
and
fair
elections
within
five
months
.


Elected
in
a
landslide
the
following
May
,
the
National
Salvation
Front
,
reconstituted
as
a
political
party
,
installed
a
series
of
economic
and
democratic
reforms
,
with
further
social
policy
changes
being
implemented
by
later
governments
.


since
that
point
romania
has
become
far
more
integrated
with
the
west
than
its
former
,
albeit
tepid
,
relations
with
moscow
.


Romania
became
a
member
of
NATO
and
the
European
Union
in
2004
and
2007
,
respectively
.


Democratic
reforms
have
proven
to
be
moderately
successful
,
though
issues
with
corruption
remain
.


Economic
reforms
continue
,
with
Romania
still
possessing
,
for
example
,
one
of
the
highest
child
poverty
rates
in
the
developed
world
.


The
Tay
Bridge
Disaster
occurred
during
a
violent
storm
on
Sunday
28
December
1879
,
when
the
first
Tay
Rail
Bridge
collapsed
as
a
train
from
Wormit
to
Dundee
passed
over
it
,
killing
all
aboard
.


The
bridge—designed
by
Sir
Thomas
Bouch—used
lattice
girders
supported
by
iron
piers
,
with
cast
iron
columns
and
wrought
iron
cross-bracing
.


The
piers
were
narrower
and
their
cross-bracing
was
less
extensive
and
robust
than
on
previous
similar
designs
by
Bouch
.


Bouch
had
sought
expert
advice
on
wind
loading
when
designing
a
proposed
rail
bridge
over
the
Firth
of
Forth
;
as
a
result
of
that
advice
he
had
made
no
explicit
allowance
for
wind
loading
in
the
design
of
the
Tay
Bridge
.


There
were
other
flaws
in
detailed
design
,
in
maintenance
,
and
in
quality
control
of
castings
,
all
of
which
were
,
at
least
in
part
,
Bouch
's
responsibility
.


Bouch
died
within
the
year
,
his
reputation
ruined
.


Future
British
bridge
designs
had
to
allow
for
wind
loadings
of
up
to
.


Bouch
's
design
for
the
Forth
Bridge
was
not
used
.


The
United
States
occupation
of
Nicaragua
from
1912
to
1933
was
part
of
the
Banana
Wars
,
when
the
US
military
intervened
in
various
Latin
American
countries
from
1898
to
1934
.


The
formal
occupation
began
in
1912
,
even
though
there
were
various
other
assaults
by
the
U.S.
in
Nicaragua
throughout
this
period
.


American
military
interventions
in
Nicaragua
were
designed
to
stop
any
other
nation
except
the
United
States
of
America
from
building
a
Nicaraguan
Canal
.


nicaragua
assumed
a
unk
status
under
the
1916
unk
treaty
.


President
Herbert
Hoover
(
1929–1933
)
opposed
the
relationship
.


Finally
in
1933
President
Franklin

Roosevelt
,
invoking
his
new
Good
Neighbor
policy
ended

On
23
July
2011
,
two
high-speed
trains
travelling
on
the
Yongtaiwen
railway
line
collided
on
a
viaduct
in
the
suburbs
of
Wenzhou
,
Zhejiang
province
,
People
's
Republic
of
China
.


The
two
trains
derailed
each
other
,
and
four
cars
fell
off
the
viaduct
.


40
people
were
killed
,
at
least
192
were
injured
,
12
of
which
were
severe
injuries
.


This
serious
traffic
disaster
was
caused
by
both
the
critical
defects
of
design
and
the
rough
management
of
the
bullet
train
company
.


Officials
responded
to
the
accident
by
hastily
concluding
rescue
operations
and
ordering
the
burial
of
the
derailed
cars
.


These
actions
elicited
strong
criticism
from
Chinese
media
and
online
communities
.


In
response
,
the
government
issued
directives
to
restrict
media
coverage
,
which
was
met
with
limited
compliance
,
even
on
state-owned
networks
.


The
collision
is
the
only
fatal
crash
involving
high-speed
rail
(
HSR
)
in
China
,
and
is
the
third-deadliest
HSR
accident
in
history
,
after
the
1998
Eschede
train
disaster
in
Germany
and
2013
Santiago
de
Compostela
rail
disaster
in
Spain
.


High
speed
was
not
a
factor
in
the
accident
,
however
,
since
neither
train
was
moving
faster
than
,
a
moderate
speed
for
a
passenger
train
.


The
accident
,
the
first
of
its
kind
,
had
a
profound
impact
on
the
development
of
high-speed
rail
in
China
.


Public
confidence
in
high-speed
rail
eroded
,
resulting
in
fewer
passengers
using
the
service
.


Construction
of
high-speed
rail
lines
in
China
was
temporarily
suspended
as
the
accident
was
under
investigation
.


Speeds
on
other
major
high-speed
rail
lines
in
China
were
reduced
.


China
's
reputation
in
high-speed
railway
technology
was
scrutinized
internationally
.


In
response
to
the
accident
,
Railways
minister
Sheng
Guangzu
announced
a
comprehensive
two-month
railway
safety
review
.


The
official
investigation
completed
in
December
2011
blamed
faulty
signal
systems
which
failed
to
warn
the
second
train
of
the
stationary
first
train
on
the
same
track
,
as
well
as
a
series
of
management
failures
on
the
part
of
railway
officials
in
carrying
out
due
procedure
.


The
accident
and
subsequent
safety
improvements
helped
implement
further
safety
measures
helping
prevent
any
further
safety
accidents
in
China
's
high
speed
rail
network
.


During
the
years
2012
to
2019
,
China
's
high
speed
rail
network
did
not
have
any
serious
accidents
.


During
the
annual
Boston
Marathon
on
April
15
,
2013
,
two
homemade
pressure
cooker
bombs
detonated
14
seconds
and
apart
at
2:49p.m.
,
near
the
finish
line
of
the
race
,
killing
three
people
and
injuring
several
hundred
others
,
including
16
who
lost
limbs
.


Three
days
later
,
the
Federal
Bureau
of
Investigation
(
FBI
)
released
images
of
two
suspects
,
who
were
later
identified
as
Chechen
Kyrgyzstani-American
brothers
Dzhokhar
Tsarnaev
and
Tamerlan
Tsarnaev
.


They
killed
an
MIT
policeman
,
kidnapped
a
man
in
his
car
,
and
had
a
shootout
with
the
police
in
nearby
Watertown
,
during
which
two
officers
were
severely
injured
,
one
of
whom
died
a
year
later
.


Tamerlan
was
shot
several
times
,
and
his
brother
ran
him
over
while
escaping
in
the
stolen
car
;
Tamerlan
died
soon
after
.


An
unprecedented
manhunt
for
Dzhokhar
ensued
on
April
19
,
with
thousands
of
law
enforcement
officers
searching
a
20-block
area
of
Watertown
;
residents
of
Watertown
and
surrounding
communities
were
asked
to
stay
indoors
,
and
the
transportation
system
and
most
businesses
and
public
places
closed
.


Around
6:00p.m.
,
a
Watertown
resident
discovered
Dzhokhar
hiding
in
a
boat
in
his
backyard
.


He
was
shot
and
wounded
by
police
before
being
taken
into
custody
.


During
questioning
,
Dzhokhar
said
that
he
and
his
brother
were
motivated
by
extremist
Islamist
beliefs
and
the
wars
in
Iraq
and
Afghanistan
,
that
they
were
self-radicalized
and
unconnected
to
any
outside
terrorist
groups
,
and
that
he
was
following
his
brother
's
lead
.


He
said
they
learned
to
build
explosive
devices
from
an
online
magazine
of
the
al-Qaeda
affiliate
in
Yemen
.


He
also
said
they
had
intended
to
travel
to
New
York
City
to
bomb
Times
Square
.


On
April
8
,
2015
,
he
was
convicted
of
30
charges
,
including
use
of
a
weapon
of
mass
destruction
and
malicious
destruction
of
property
resulting
in
death
.


Two
months
later
,
he
was
sentenced
to
death
.


The
First
International
Silent
Games
,
or
First
International
Games
for
the
Deaf
,
now
referred
to
retroactively
as
the
1924
Summer
Deaflympics
,
were
the
inaugural
edition
of
the
Deaflympics
.


The
Games
were
held
in
Paris
,
France
,
from
10
to
17
August
1924
,
as
an
equivalent
to
the
Olympic
Games
for
deaf
athletes
.


They
were
organised
on
the
initiative
of
deaf
Frenchman
Eugène
Rubens-Alcais
,
who
,
just
after
the
Games
,
co-founded
the
Comité
International
des
Sports
des
Sourds
with
other
``
deaf
sporting
leaders
''
.


(
Rubens-Alcais
had
previously
founded
France
's
first
sports
federation
for
the
deaf
and
mute
,
in
1918
.
)


The
1924
Games
were
``
the
first
games
ever
''
for
athletes
with
a
disability
,
preceding
the
World
Wheelchair
and
Amputee
Games
in
1948
,
which
became
the
Paralympic
Games
in
1960
but
which
did
not
include
events
for
deaf
athletes
.


These
First
Silent
Games
were
held
just
two
weeks
after
the
end
of
the
1924
Summer
Olympics
,
also
in
Paris
.


The
Games
for
the
deaf
were
``
modelled
on
the
Olympic
Games
''
.


Nine
countries
,
``
including
six
official
national
federations
already
in
existence
''
,
sent
148
athletes
to
compete
,
in
seven
sports
:
athletics
,
road
cycling
,
diving
,
football
,
shooting
,
swimming
,
and
tennis
.


Demonstration
events
were
also
held
in
gymnastics
.


Not
counting
gymnastics
,
a
total
of
31
events
were
held
.


Specifically
,
France
,
Belgium
,
Great
Britain
,
Latvia
,
the
Netherlands
,
and
Poland
``
already
had
a
sports
federation
''
for
the
deaf
,
while
Italy
,
Romania
and
Hungary
each
sent
one
athlete
despite
having
no
such
federation
yet
.


There
were
147
male
athletes
,
and
only
one
female
athlete
:
Hendrika
Nicoline
Van
der
Heyden
,
of
the
Netherlands
.


She
``
competed
''
alone
in
the
100m
backstroke
event
for
women
in
swimming
,
completing
it
in
2:03.6
,
which
set
a
world
record
.


It
was
the
only
walkover
,
as
there
were
at
least
two
competitors
in
each
of
the
men
's
thirty
events
(
three
competitors
in
all
but
one
)
.


The
host
country
,
France
,
dominated
,
winning
sixteen
of
the
seventeen
events
in
athletics
;
the
sole
exception
was
the
javelin
throw
,
where
Belgian
Nicolas
François
came
first
ahead
of
Frenchman
Raymond
Code
.


Frenchman
Émile
Van
den
Torren
won
the
most
events
overall
,
coming
first
in
the
1,500
metres
,
5,000
metres
and
10,000
metres
in
athletics
.


France
also
swept
up
all
three
gold
medals
in
cycling
,
the
only
gold
medal
in
shooting
,
one
of
the
two
gold
in
tennis
,
and
won
the
football
competition
.


By
contrast
,
the
six
swimming
events
were
much
more
open
;
France
won
none
,
and
the
six
gold
medals
were
shared
between
the
Netherlands
,
Italy
and
the
United
Kingdom
(
competing
as
``
Great
Britain
''
)
.


The
British
also
won
one
of
the
tennis
events
:
the
men
's
doubles
.


The
Games
were
deemed
a
success
,
and
a
second
edition
was
held
four
years
later
in
Amsterdam
,
with
212
athletes
from
ten
nations
–
including
,
this
time
,
fourteen
women
.


(
Amsterdam
also
held
the
Olympic
Games
that
year
.
)


With
the
1924
Games
being
the
first
in
a
regular
series
,
the
International
Games
for
the
Deaf
were
established
as
``
the
second
oldest
international
multi-sport
event
in
the
world
''
,
after
the
Olympic
Games
.

was
a
british
south
american

(

avro
lancastrian
airliner
which
crashed
into
mount
tupungato
in
the
argentine
andes
on
2
august
1947
,
during
a
flight
from
buenos
aires
to
santiago
,
chile
.


A
comprehensive
search
of
a
wide
area
(
including
what
is
now
known
to
have
been
the
crash
site
)
was
fruitless
,
and
the
fate
of
the
aircraft
and
its
occupants
remained
unknown
for
over
50
years
,
giving
rise
to
various
conspiracy
theories
about
its
disappearance
.


In
the
late
1990s
,
pieces
of
wreckage
from
the
missing
aircraft
began
to
emerge
from
the
glacial
ice
.


It
is
now
believed
that
the
crew
became
confused
as
to
their
exact
location
while
flying
at
high
altitudes
through
the
(
then
poorly
understood
)
jet
stream
.

The
was
a
nuclear
accident
at
the
Fukushima
Daiichi
Nuclear
Power
Plant
in
Ōkuma
,
Fukushima
Prefecture
.


The
disaster
was
the
most
severe
nuclear
accident
since
the
26
April
1986
Chernobyl
disaster
and
the
only
other
disaster
to
be
given
the
Level
7
event
classification
of
the
International
Nuclear
Event
Scale
.


The
accident
was
started
by
the
Tōhoku
earthquake
and
tsunami
on
11
March
2011
.


On
detecting
the
earthquake
,
the
active
reactors
automatically
shut
down
their
fission
reactions
.


Because
of
the
reactor
trips
and
other
grid
problems
,
the
electricity
supply
failed
,
and
the
reactors
'
emergency
diesel
generators
automatically
started
.


Critically
,
they
were
powering
the
pumps
that
circulated
coolant
through
the
reactors
'
cores
to
remove
decay
heat
,
which
continues
after
fission
has
ceased
.


The
earthquake
generated
a
14-meter-high
tsunami
that
arrived
46
minutes
later
,
sweeping
over
the
plant
's
seawall
and
flooding
the
plant
's
lower
grounds
around
the
Units
1-4
reactor
buildings
with
sea
water
,
which
filled
the
basements
and
knocked
out
the
emergency
generators
.


The
resultant
loss-of-coolant
accidents
led
to
three
nuclear
meltdowns
,
three
hydrogen
explosions
,
and
the
release
of
radioactive
contamination
in
Units
1
,
2
and
3
between
12
and
15
March
.


The
spent
fuel
pool
of
previously
shutdown
Reactor
4
increased
in
temperature
on
15
March
due
to
decay
heat
from
newly-added
spent
fuel
rods
;
but
did
not
boil
down
sufficiently
to
expose
the
fuel
.


In
the
days
after
the
accident
,
radiation
released
to
the
atmosphere
forced
the
government
to
declare
an
ever
larger
evacuation
zone
around
the
plant
,
culminating
in
an
evacuation
zone
with
a
20-kilometer
radius
.


All
told
,
some
154,000
residents
evacuated
from
the
communities
surrounding
the
plant
due
to
the
rising
off-site
levels
of
ambient
ionizing
radiation
caused
by
airborne
radioactive
contamination
from
the
damaged
reactors
.


Large
amounts
of
water
contaminated
with
radioactive
isotopes
were
released
into
the
Pacific
Ocean
during
and
after
the
disaster
.


Michio
Aoyama
,
a
professor
of
radioisotope
geoscience
at
the
Institute
of
Environmental
Radioactivity
,
has
estimated
that
18,000
terabecquerel
(
TBq
)
of
radioactive
caesium
137
were
released
into
the
Pacific
during
the
accident
,
and
in
2013
,
30
gigabecquerel
(
GBq
)
of
caesium
137
were
still
flowing
into
the
ocean
every
day
.


The
plant
's
operator
has
since
built
new
walls
along
the
coast
and
also
created
a
1.5-kilometer-long
``
ice
wall
''
of
frozen
earth
to
stop
the
flow
of
contaminated
water
.


While
there
has
been
ongoing
controversy
over
the
health
effects
of
the
disaster
,
a
2014
report
by
the
United
Nations
Scientific
Committee
on
the
Effects
of
Atomic
Radiation
(
UNSCEAR
)
and
World
Health
Organization
projected
no
increase
in
miscarriages
,
stillbirths
or
physical
and
mental
disorders
in
babies
born
after
the
accident
.


An
ongoing
intensive
cleanup
program
to
both
decontaminate
affected
areas
and
decommission
the
plant
will
take
30
to
40
years
,

management
estimate

on
5
july
2012
,
the

diet
of

fukushima
nuclear
accident
independent
investigation
commission
(

)
found
that
the
causes
of
the
accident
had
been
foreseeable
,
and
that
the

company
(

,
had
failed
to
meet
basic
safety
requirements
such
as

assessment
,
preparing
for
containing
collateral
damage
,
and
developing
evacuation
plans
.


At
a
meeting
in
Vienna
three
months
after
the
disaster
,
the
International
Atomic
Energy
Agency
faulted
lax
oversight
by
the
Ministry
of
Economy
,
Trade
and
Industry
,
saying
the
ministry
faced
an
inherent
conflict
of
interest
as
the
government
agency
in
charge
of
both
regulating
and
promoting
the
nuclear
power
industry
.


On
12
October
2012
,
TEPCO
admitted
for
the
first
time
that
it
had
failed
to
take
necessary
measures
for
fear
of
inviting
lawsuits
or
protests
against
its
nuclear
plants
.


The
Chicago
Tylenol
Murders
were
a
series
of
poisoning
deaths
resulting
from
drug
tampering
in
the
Chicago
metropolitan
area
in
1982
.


The
victims
had
all
taken
Tylenol-branded
acetaminophen
capsules
that
had
been
laced
with
potassium
cyanide
.


A
total
of
seven
people
died
in
the
original
poisonings
,
with
several
more
deaths
in
subsequent
copycat
crimes
.


No
suspect
was
ever
charged
or
convicted
of
the
poisonings
.


New

City
resident
James
William
Lewis
was
convicted
of
extortion
for
sending

letter
to
Johnson

Johnson
that
took
credit
for
the
deaths
and
demanded
$
1
million
to
stop
them
,
but
evidence
tying
him
to
the
actual
poisoning
never
emerged
.


The
incidents
led
to
reforms
in

substances
and
to

The
actions
of
Johnson
&
Johnson
to
reduce
deaths
and
warn
the
public
of
poisoning
risks
have
been
widely
praised
as
an
exemplary
public
relations
response
to
such
a
crisis
.


The
Chelyabinsk
meteor
was
a
superbolide
that
entered
Earth
's
atmosphere
over
Russia
on
15
February
2013
at
about
09:20
YEKT
(
03:20
UTC
)
.


It
was
caused
by
an
approximately
near-Earth
asteroid
with
a
speed
of
19.16
±
0.15
kilometres
per
second
(
60,000–69,000
km/h
or
40,000–42,900
mph
)
.


It
quickly
became
a
brilliant
superbolide
meteor
over
the
southern
Ural
region
.


The
light
from
the
meteor
was
brighter
than
the
Sun
,
visible
up
to
away
.


It
was
observed
over
a
wide
area
of
the
region
and
in
neighbouring
republics
.


Some
eyewitnesses
also
felt
intense
heat
from
the
fireball
.


Due
to
its
high
velocity
and
shallow
angle
of
atmospheric
entry
,
the
object
exploded
in
an
air
burst
over
Chelyabinsk
Oblast
,
at
a
height
of
around
.


The
explosion
generated
a
bright
flash
,
producing
a
hot
cloud
of
dust
and
gas
that
penetrated
to
,
and
many
surviving
small
fragmentary
meteorites
,
as
well
as
a
large
shock
wave
.


The
bulk
of
the
object
's
energy
was
absorbed
by
the
atmosphere
,
with
a
total
kinetic
energy
before
atmospheric
impact
estimated
from
infrasound
and
seismic
measurements
to
be
equivalent
to
the
blast
yield
of
400–500
kilotons
of
TNT
(
about
1.4–1.8
PJ
)
range
–
26
to
33
times
as
much
energy
as
that
released
from
the
atomic
bomb
detonated
at
Hiroshima
.


The
object
was
undetected
before
its
atmospheric
entry
,
in
part
because
its
radiant
was
close
to
the
Sun
.


Its
explosion
created
panic
among
local
residents
,
and
about
1,500
people
were
injured
seriously
enough
to
seek
medical
treatment
.


All
of
the
injuries
were
due
to
indirect
effects
rather
than
the
meteor
itself
,
mainly
from
broken
glass
from
windows
that
were
blown
in
when
the
shock
wave
arrived
,
minutes
after
the
superbolide
's
flash
.


Some
7,200
buildings
in
six
cities
across
the
region
were
damaged
by
the
explosion
's
shock
wave
,
and
authorities
scrambled
to
help
repair
the
structures
in
sub-freezing
temperatures
.


With
an
estimated
initial
mass
of
about
12,000–13,000
tonnes
(
13,000–14,000
short
tons
,
heavier
than
the
Eiffel
Tower
)
,
and
measuring
about
in
diameter
,
it
is
the
largest
known
natural
object
to
have
entered
Earth
's
atmosphere
since
the
1908
Tunguska
event
,
which
destroyed
a
wide
,
remote
,
forested
,
and
very
sparsely
populated
area
of
Siberia
.


The
Chelyabinsk
meteor
is
also
the
only
meteor
confirmed
to
have
resulted
in
a
large
number
of
injuries
.


No
deaths
were
reported
.


The
earlier-predicted
and
well-publicized
close
approach
of
a
larger
asteroid
on
the
same
day
,
the
roughly
367943
Duende
,
occurred
about
16
hours
later
;
the
very
different
orbits
of
the
two
objects
showed
they
were
unrelated
to
each
other
.


Operation
Mincemeat
was
a
successful
British
deception
operation
of
the
Second
World
War
to
disguise
the
1943
Allied
invasion
of
Sicily
.


Two
members
of
British
intelligence
obtained
the
body
of
Glyndwr
Michael
,
a
tramp
who
died
from
eating
rat
poison
,
dressed
him
as
an
officer
of
the
Royal
Marines
and
placed
personal
items
on
him
identifying
him
as
the
fictitious
Captain
(
Acting
Major
)
William
Martin
.


Correspondence
between
two
British
generals
which
suggested
that
the
Allies
planned
to
invade
Greece
and
Sardinia
,
with
Sicily
as
merely
the
target
of
a
feint
,
was
also
placed
on
the
body
.


Part
of
the
wider
Operation
Barclay
,
Mincemeat
was
based
on
the
1939
Trout
memo
,
written
by
Rear
Admiral
John
Godfrey
,
the
Director
of
the
Naval
Intelligence
Division
and
his
personal
assistant
,
Lieutenant
Commander
Ian
Fleming
.


With
the
approval
of
the
British
Prime
Minister
,
Winston
Churchill
and
the
military
commander
in
the
Mediterranean
,
General
Dwight
D.
Eisenhower
,
the
plan
began
by
transporting
the
body
to
the
southern
coast
of
Spain
by
submarine
and
releasing
it
close
to
shore
,
where
it
was
picked
up
the
following
morning
by
a
Spanish
fisherman
.


The
nominally
neutral
Spanish
government
shared
copies
of
the
documents
with
the
,
the
German
military
intelligence
organisation
,
before
returning
the
originals
to
the
British
.


Forensic
examination
showed
they
had
been
read
and
Ultra
decrypts
of
German
messages
showed
that
the
Germans
fell
for
the
ruse
.


Reinforcements
were
shifted
to
Greece
and
Sardinia
before
and
during
the
invasion
of
Sicily
;
Sicily
received
none
.


The
effect
of
Operation
Mincemeat
is
unknown
,
although
Sicily
was
liberated
more
quickly
than
anticipated
and
losses
were
lower
than
predicted
.


The
events
were
depicted
in
``
Operation
Heartbreak
''
,
a
1950
novel
by
the
former
cabinet
minister
Duff
Cooper
,
before
one
of
the
agents
who
planned
and
carried
out
Mincemeat
,
Ewen
Montagu
,
wrote
a
history
in
1953
.


Montagu
's
work
formed
the
basis
for
the
1956
British
film
``
The
Man
Who
Never
Was
''
.


Hurricane
Iris
was
the
first
of
three
tropical
cyclones
to
affect
the
Lesser
Antilles
in
a
three-week
period
,
preceding
the
more
destructive
hurricanes
Luis
and
Marilyn
.


The
ninth
named
storm
and
fifth
hurricane
of
the
1995
Atlantic
hurricane
season
,
Iris
developed
from
a
tropical
wave
to
the
east
of
the
Lesser
Antilles
on
August
22
and
attained
hurricane
status
within
30
hours
.


The
hurricane
weakened
to
a
tropical
storm
before
crossing
the
islands
of
the
eastern
Caribbean
from
August
26
through
August
28
.


During
that
time
,
Iris
became
one
of
four
active
tropical
storms
in
the
Atlantic
basin
.


earlier
it
had
interacted
with
hurricane
humberto
,
and
beginning
on
august
30
,
iris
interacted
with
tropical
storm
karen
.


Iris
re-intensified
into
a
hurricane
and
attained
peak
sustained
winds
of
110
mph
(
175
km/h
)
while
moving
slowly
across
the
central
Atlantic
.


The
hurricane
accelerated
to
the
north
and
absorbed
a
dissipating
Karen
on
September
3
.


Iris
weakened
to
a
tropical
storm
and
became
extratropical
on
September
4
,
though
its
remnants
reattained
hurricane-force
winds
before
affecting
western
Europe
on
September
7
.


As
a
tropical
storm
,
Iris
produced
heavy
rainfall
across
much
of
the
Leeward
Islands
.


In
the
southern
Lesser
Antilles
,
high
waves
caused
coastal
flooding
in
Trinidad
,
while
in
Martinique
further
north
,
significant
amounts
of
precipitation
led
to
flooding
and
landslides
.


The
threat
from
the
hurricane
halted
airplane
evacuations
on
Montserrat
,
which
was
being
threatened
by
the
eruption
of
the
Soufrière
Hills
volcano
.


There
were
five
deaths
in
association
with
Iris—four
in
Martinique
,
and
one
in
Guadeloupe
.


The
floods
in
Pakistan
began
in
late
July
2010
,
resulting
from
heavy
monsoon
rains
in
the
Khyber
Pakhtunkhwa
,
Sindh
,
Punjab
and
,
Balochistan
regions
of
Pakistan
,
which
affected
the
Indus
River
basin
.


Approximately
one-fifth
of
Pakistan
's
total
land
area
was
affected
by
floods
,
with
the
Khyber
Pakhtunkhwa
province
facing
the
brunt
of
the
damage
and
casualties
(
above
90
%
of
the
deaths
occurred
in
that
Province
)
.


According
to
Pakistani
government
data
,
the
floods
directly
affected
about
20
million
people
,
mostly
by
destruction
of
property
,
livelihood
and
infrastructure
,
with
a
death
toll
of
close
to
2,000
.


UN
Secretary-General
Ban
Ki-moon
had
initially
asked
for
US
$
460
million
(
€420
million
)
for
emergency
relief
,
noting
that
the
flood
was
the
worst
disaster
he
had
ever
seen
.


Only
20
%
of
the
relief
funds
requested
had
been
received
on
15
August
2010
.


The
U.N.
had
been
concerned
that
aid
was
not
arriving
fast
enough
,
and
the
World
Health
Organization
reported
that
ten
million
people
were
forced
to
drink
unsafe
water
.


The
Pakistani
economy
was
harmed
by
extensive
damage
to
infrastructure
and
crops
.


Damage
to
structures
was
estimated
to
exceed
US
$
4
billion
(
€2.5
billion
)
,
and
wheat
crop
damages
were
estimated
to
be
over
US
$
500
million
(
€425
million
)
.


Total
economic
impact
may
have
been
as
much
as
US
$
43
billion
(
€35
billion
)
.


The
1924
Cuba
hurricane
is
the
earliest
officially
classified
Category
5
Atlantic
hurricane
on
the
Saffir–Simpson
scale
(
SSHS
)
,
and
one
of
two
hurricanes
to
make
landfall
on
Cuba
at
Category
5
intensity
,
the
other
being
Hurricane
Irma
in
2017
–
both
are
also
tied
for
the
strongest
Cuban
landfall
in
terms
of
maximum
sustained
winds
.


The
hurricane
formed
on
October
14
in
the
western
Caribbean
,
slowly
organizing
as
it
tracked
northwestward
.


By
October
16
,
the
storm
attained
hurricane
status
to
the
east
of
the
Yucatán
Peninsula
,
and
subsequently
executed
a
small
counterclockwise
loop
.


On
October
18
,
the
hurricane
began
undergoing
rapid
deepening
and
,
on
the
next
day
,
reached
an
estimated
peak
intensity
of
165
mph
(
270
km/h
)
.


Shortly
thereafter
,
it
struck
extreme
western
Cuba
at
peak
intensity
,
becoming
the
strongest
hurricane
on
record
to
hit
the
country
.


Later
the
hurricane
weakened
greatly
,
striking
southwestern
Florida
with
winds
of
90
mph
(
150
km/h
)
in
a
sparsely
populated
region
.


While
crossing
the
state
it
weakened
to
tropical
storm
status
,
and
after
accelerating
east-northeastward
,
it
was
absorbed
by
a
cold
front
on
October
23
,
to
the
south
of
Bermuda
.


Across
the
western
Caribbean
Sea
,
the
developing
storm
produced
heavy
rainfall
and
increased
winds
.


Strong
winds
in
western
Cuba
caused
severe
damage
,
with
two
small
towns
nearly
destroyed
.


About
90
people
were
killed
in
the
country
,
all
in
Pinar
del
Río
Province
.


Later
,
the
hurricane
brought
heavy
rainfall
to
southern
Florida
,
which
caused
flooding
and
crop
damage
.


Damage
was
light
in
the
state
,
and
there
were
no
casualties
.


Hurricane
Greta–Olivia
was
one
of
ten
named
Atlantic
hurricanes
to
cross
over
Central
America
into
the
eastern
Pacific
while
remaining
a
tropical
cyclone
.


The
seventh
named
storm
of
the
1978
Atlantic
hurricane
season
,
Greta
formed
from
a
tropical
wave
just
northwest
of
Trinidad
on
September
13
,
and
despite
being
in
a
climatologically
unfavorable
area
,
gradually
intensified
while
moving
west-northwestward
.


On
September
16
,
it
became
a
hurricane
south
of
Jamaica
.


Two
days
later
,
the
well-defined
eye
approached
northeastern
Honduras
but
veered
to
the
northwest
.


After
reaching
peak
winds
of
130
mph
(
215
km/h
)
that
day
,
Greta
weakened
while
paralleling
the
northern
Honduras
coast
just
offshore
.


On
September
19
,
it
made
landfall
on
Belize
near
Dangriga
and
quickly
weakened
into
a
tropical
depression
while
crossing
Guatemala
and
southeastern
Mexico
.


After
entering
the
eastern
Pacific
,
the
system
re-intensified
into
a
hurricane
and
was
renamed
Olivia
,
which
weakened
before
dissipating
over
Chiapas
on
September
23
.


Taking
a
similar
path
to
Hurricane
Fifi
four
years
prior
,
Greta
threatened
to
reproduce
the
devastating
effects
of
the
catastrophic
storm
;
however
,
damage
and
loss
of
life
was
significantly
less
than
feared
.


In
Honduras
,
about
1,200
homes
were
damaged
,
about
half
of
which
in
towns
along
the
coastline
.


The
storm
damaged
about
75
%
of
the
houses
on
Roatán
along
the
offshore
Bay
Islands
,
and
there
was
one
death
in
the
country
.


In
the
Belize
Barrier
Reef
,
Greta
downed
trees
and
produced
high
waves
,
while
on
the
mainland
,
there
was
minimal
flooding
despite
a
high
storm
surge
.


In
Dangriga
where
it
made
landfall
,
the
hurricane
damaged
or
destroyed
125
houses
and
the
primary
hospital
.


In
Belize
City
,
a
tornado
flipped
over
a
truck
and
damaged
four
houses
.


Damage
in
Belize
was
estimated
at
$
25
million
(
1978
USD
)
,
and
there
were
four
deaths
.

Operation
``
Strike
of
the
Sword
or
Operation
``
Khanjar
was
a
US-led
offensive
in
Helmand
province
in

to
capture
Malacca
from
the
Portuguese
.


In
the
early
17th
century
,
the
Dutch
East
India
Company
(
``
Verenigde
Oostindische
Compagnie
''
,
``
VOC
''
)
began
the
campaign
to
destroy
Portuguese
power
in
the
East
.


At
that
time
,
the
Portuguese
had
transformed
Malacca
into
an
impregnable
fortress
(
the
``
Fortaleza
de
Malaca
''
)
,
controlling
access
to
the
sea
lanes
of
the
Straits
of
Malacca
and
the
spice
trade
there
.


The
Dutch
started
by
launching
small
incursions
and
skirmishes
against
the
Portuguese
.


the
first
serious
attempt
was
the
siege
of
malacca
in
1606
by
the
third
voc
fleet
from
holland
with
eleven
ships
,
led
by
admiral
cornelis
unk
de
jonge
that
lead
to
the
naval
battle
of
cape
unk
.


although
the
dutch
were
routed
,
the
portuguese
fleet
of
martim
afonso
de
castro
,
the
viceroy
of
portuguese
india
,
suffered
heavier
casualties
and
the
battle
rallied
the
forces
of
the
sultanate
of
johor
in
an
alliance
with
the
dutch
.


The
Dutch
with
their
local
allies
assaulted
and
wrested
Malacca
from
the
Portuguese
in
January
1641
.


This
combined
Dutch-Johor
effort
effectively
destroyed
the
last
bastion
of
Portuguese
power
,
removing
their
influence
in
the
Malay
archipelago
.


In
line
with
the
agreement
with
Johor
in
1606
,
the
Dutch
took
control
of
Malacca
and
agreed
not
to
seek
territories
or
wage
war
with
the
Malay
kingdoms
.


The
Atlantic
campaign
of
1806
was
a
complicated
series
of
manoeuvrees
and
counter-manoeuveres
conducted
by
squadrons
of
the
French
Navy
and
the
British
Royal
Navy
across
the
Atlantic
Ocean
during
the
spring
and
summer
of
1806
,
as
part
of
the
Napoleonic
Wars
.


The
campaign
followed
directly
from
the
Trafalgar
campaign
of
the
year
before
,
in
which
the
French
Mediterranean
fleet
had
crossed
the
Atlantic
,
returned
to
Europe
and
joined
with
the
Spanish
fleet
.


on
21
october
1805
,
this
combined
force
was
destroyed
by
a
british
fleet
under
lord
nelson
at
the
battle
of
trafalgar
,
although
the
campaign
did
not
end
until
the
battle
of
cape
ortegal
on
4
november
1805
.


Believing
that
the
French
Navy
would
not
be
capable
of
organised
resistance
at
sea
during
the
winter
,
the
First
Lord
of
the
Admiralty
Lord
Barham
withdrew
the
British
blockade
squadrons
to
harbour
.


Barham
had
miscalculated
–
the
French
Atlantic
fleet
,
based
at
Brest
,
had
not
been
involved
in
the
Trafalgar
campaign
and
was
therefore
at
full
strength
.


Taking
advantage
of
the
reduction
in
the
British
forces
off
the
port
,
Napoleon
ordered
two
heavy
squadrons
to
sea
,
under
instructions
to
raid
British
trade
routes
while
avoiding
contact
with
equivalent
Royal
Navy
forces
.


Departing
from
Brest
on
13
December
1805
,
it
was
12
days
before
the
Admiralty
in
London
were
aware
of
the
French
movements
,
by
which
time
the
French
squadrons
were
deep
in
the
Atlantic
,
one
under
Vice-Admiral
Corentin-Urbain
Leissègues
intending
to
cruise
in
the
Caribbean
and
the
other
,
under
Contre-Admiral
Jean-Baptiste
Willaumez
,
sailing
for
the
South
Atlantic
.


Two
British
squadrons
were
hastily
mustered
and
dispatched
in
pursuit
,
one
under
the
command
of
Rear-Admiral
Sir
Richard
Strachan
and
the
other
under
Rear-Admiral
Sir
John
Borlase
Warren
.


These
squadrons
were
joined
by
a
third
under
Rear-Admiral
Sir
John
Thomas
Duckworth
,
who
had
deserted
his
station
off
Cadiz
when
he
learned
news
of
a
French
squadron
to
his
south
and
subsequently
crossed
the
Atlantic
in
pursuit
of
Willaumez
.


although
willaumez
managed
to
escape
into
the
south
atlantic
,
UNK
was
less
successful
and
was
discovered
and
destroyed
at
the
battle
of
san
domingo
in
february
1806
by
a
combined
force
under
duckworth
and
rear-admiral
alexander
cochrane
.


Other
squadrons
already
at
sea
became
embroiled
in
the
campaign
:
a
smaller
squadron
that
had
been
raiding
the
African
coast
under
Commodore
Jean-Marthe-Adrien
L'Hermite
since
August
1805
provided
a
diversion
to
the
major
campaign
but
failed
to
draw
off
significant
British
forces
,
while
the
remnants
of
a
French
squadron
under
Contre-Admiral
Charles-Alexandre
Durand
Linois
that
had
been
operating
in
the
Indian
Ocean
since
1803
was
intercepted
and
defeated
by
Warren
in
March
,
after
a
chance
encounter
on
its
journey
back
to
France
.


Willaumez
achieved
minor
success
in
his
operations
in
the
South
Atlantic
and
Caribbean
,
but
was
caught
in
a
summer
hurricane
on
his
return
journey
and
his
ships
were
scattered
along
the
Eastern
Seaboard
of
North
America
.


One
was
intercepted
and
destroyed
by
British
forces
and
others
were
so
badly
damaged
in
the
storm
that
they
were
forced
to
shelter
in
American
ports
.


The
survivors
gradually
returned
to
Brest
during
the
autumn
,
the
last
arriving
in
early
1807
.


The
campaign
was
the
last
significant
operation
in
the
Atlantic
for
the
remainder
of
the
war
,
and
no
French
squadron
of
any
size
left
any
of
the
Biscay
ports
until
1808
.


The
losses
suffered
by
the
Brest
fleet
weakened
it
so
severely
that
it
would
not
participate
in
a
major
operation
until
1809
,
when
an
attempt
to
break
out
of
Brest
ended
in
defeat
at
the
Battle
of
Basque
Roads
.


hurricane
isaac
was
a
strong
and
large
cape
verde
hurricane
that
lasted
through
late
september
and
early
october
2000
.


the
thirteenth
tropical
cyclone
,
ninth
named
storm
,
and
the
fifth
hurricane
of
2000
atlantic
hurricane
season
,
isaac
developed
from
a
tropical
wave
south
of
cape
verde
on
september
21
.


the
depression
intensified
,
and
on
the
following
day
,
it
was
upgraded
to
tropical
storm
isaac
.


Due
to
conductive
atmospheric
conditions
,
Isaac
continued
to
strengthen
,
and
attained
hurricane
intensity
on
September
23
.


Isaac
managed
to
become
a
Category
3
hurricane
on
September
24
,
before
steadily
weakening
shortly
thereafter
.


By
September
26
,
the
storm
had
deteriorated
to
a
Category
1
hurricane
.


However
,
it
again
encountered
favorable
conditions
,
which
caused
Isaac
to
re-intensify
.


As
Isaac
tracked
northwestward
,
it
re-strengthened
into
a
major
hurricane
on
September
28
.


Later
that
day
,
Isaac
peaked
as
a
moderate-Category
4
hurricane
.


However
,
Isaac
began
to
track
northward
over
an
area
of
colder
sea
surface
temperatures
(
SSTs
)
,
which
gradually
weakened
the
storm
over
the
next
three
days
.


Eventually
,
the
storm
curved
northeastward
,
and
weakened
to
a
tropical
storm
early
on
October
1
.


Later
that
day
,
Isaac
transitioned
into
an
extratropical
cyclone
.


While
extratropical
,
Isaac
brushed
the
British
Isles
,
producing
below
gale-force
winds
.


Isaac
's
extratropical
remnants
were
eventually
absorbed
into
another
extratropical
storm
to
the
north
of
Scotland
,
on
October
4
.


The
storm
had
no
interaction
with
land
while
tropical
;
however
,
one
fatality
occurred
on
Long
Island
when
large
swells
generated
by
Isaac
overturned
a
boat
.


In
addition
,
rough
seas
also
affected
the
coastlines
of
Bermuda
and
The
Carolinas
.


Who
's
That
Girl
World
Tour
was
the
second
concert
tour
by
American
singer
and
songwriter
Madonna
.


The
tour
supported
her
1986
third
studio
album
``
True
Blue
''
,
as
well
as
the
1987
soundtrack
``
Who
's
That
Girl
''
.


It
was
Madonna
's
first
world
tour
,
reaching
Asia
,
North
America
and
Europe
.


Musically
and
technically
superior
to
her
previous
initiative
,
the
Who
's
That
Girl
Tour
incorporated
multimedia
components
to
make
the
show
more
appealing
.


Madonna
trained
physically
doing
aerobics
,
jogging
and
weight-lifting
,
to
cope
with
the
choreography
and
the
dance
routines
.


For
the
costumes
,
she
collaborated
with
designer
Marlene
Stewart
,
expanding
on
the
idea
of
bringing
her
popular
video
characters
to
life
onstage
,
reworking
scenes
from
her
music
videos
.


The
stage
had
four
video
screens
,
multimedia
projectors
and
a
flight
of
stairs
in
the
middle
.


Patrick
Leonard
,
who
was
the
music
director
,
encouraged
Madonna
to
go
with
the
idea
of
remixing
and
presenting
her
older
songs
for
the
show
.


The
title
Who
's
That
Girl
came
to
Madonna
's
mind
when
during
rehearsals
one-day
when
she
looked
at
a
gigantic
image
of
herself
,
projected
on
a
screen
on
the
stage
.


The
show
consisted
of
seven
costume
changes
,
with
song-and-dance
routines
,
theatrics
and
addressing
social
causes
.


The
tour
was
critically
appreciated
,
with
reviewers
commending
the
extravagant
nature
of
the
concert
and
Madonna
as
a
performer
.


It
was
a
commercial
success
,
grossing
in
total
of
US
$
25
million
(
$
million
in
dollars
)
by
playing
in
front
of
1.5
million
audience
.


According
to
Pollstar
,
it
was
the
second
highest-grossing
female
concert
tour
of
1987
,
behind
Tina
Turner
's
Break
Every
Rule
Tour
.


Who
's
That
Girl
was
broadcast
in
a
number
of
international
television
channels
and
was
released
in
VHS
titled
``
''
.


Biographer
J.
Randy
Taraborrelli
commented
that
``
Many
female
artists
behave
like
a
diva
for
a
period
when
they
reach
superstar
status
,
and
the
'Who
's
That
Girl
?
'


tour
marked
the
beginning
of
Madonna
's
.
''


It
is
also
noted
for
giving
rise
to
the
term
``
new
Madonna
''
,
a
stronger
and
more
intelligent
sexual
image
of
her
former
self
which
had
given
rise
to
the
term
Madonna
wannabe
.


A
statue
of
Madonna
,
wearing
a
conical
bra
,
was
erected
in
her
name
at
the
center
of
the
town
of
Pacentro
in
Italy
,
where
her
ancestors
used
to
live
.


The
Byzantine–Seljuq
Wars
were
a
series
of
decisive
battles
that
shifted
the
balance
of
power
in
Asia
Minor
and
Syria
from
the
Byzantine
Empire
to
the
Seljuqs
.


Riding
from
the
steppes
of
Central
Asia
,
the
Seljuq
replicated
tactics
practiced
by
the
Huns
hundreds
of
years
earlier
against
a
similar
Roman
opponent
but
now
combining
it
with
new-found
Islamic
zeal
;
in
many
ways
,
the
Seljuq
resumed
the
conquests
of
the
Muslims
in
the
Byzantine–Arab
Wars
initiated
by
the
Rashidun
,
Umayyad
and
Abassid
Caliphate
in
the
Levant
,
North
Africa
and
Asia
Minor
.


Today
,
the
Battle
of
Manzikert
is
widely
seen
as
the
moment
when
the
Byzantines
lost
the
war
against
the
Turks
;
however
the
Byzantine
military
was
of
questionable
quality
before
1071
with
regular
Turkish
incursions
overrunning
the
failing
theme
system
.


Even
after
Manzikert
,
Byzantine
rule
over
Asia
Minor
did
not
end
immediately
,
nor
were
any
heavy
concessions
levied
by
the
Turks
on
their
opponents
–
it
took
another
20
years
before
the
Turks
were
in
control
of
the
entire
Anatolian
peninsula
and
not
for
long
either
.


During
the
course
of
the
war
,
the
Seljuq
Turks
and
their
allies
attacked
the
Fatimid
Caliphate
of
Egypt
,
capturing
Jerusalem
and
catalyzing
the
call
for
the
First
Crusade
.


Crusader
assistance
to
the
Byzantine
Empire
was
mixed
with
treachery
and
looting
,
although
substantial
gains
were
made
in
the
First
Crusade
.


Within
a
hundred
years
of
Manzikert
,
the
Byzantines
had
successfully
driven
back
the
Turks
from
the
coasts
of
Asia
Minor
and
extended
their
influence
right
down
to
Palestine
and
even
Egypt
.


Later
,
the
Byzantines
were
unable
to
extract
any
more
assistance
,
and
the
Fourth
Crusade
even
led
to
the
sack
of
Constantinople
.


Before
the
conflict
petered
out
,
the
Seljuqs
managed
to
take
more
territory
from
the
weakened
Empire
of
Nicaea
until
the
Sultanate
itself
was
taken
over
by
the
Mongols
,
leading
to
the
rise
of
the
ghazis
and
the
conclusive
Byzantine–Ottoman
wars
.


The

5
First

We
can

get
a

he
'd
be
kinda
hard
to
replace
.


It
's
too
bad
really
,
'cause
we
ca
n't
finish
the
show
the
way
we
rehearsed
.


We
always
have
to
run
off

,
and
we
ca
n't
thank
the
audience

stuff
,
you
know
the

we

really

we
just
have

The
Cherry
Valley
massacre
was
an
attack
by
British
and
Iroquois
forces
on
a
fort
and
the
village
of
Cherry
Valley
in
eastern
New
York
on
November
11
,
1778
,
during
the
American
Revolutionary
War
.


It
has
been
described
as
one
of
the
most
horrific
frontier
massacres
of
the
war
.


A
mixed
force
of
Loyalists
,
British
soldiers
,
Seneca
and
Mohawks
descended
on
Cherry
Valley
,
whose
defenders
,
despite
warnings
,
were
unprepared
for
the
attack
.


During
the
raid
,
the
Seneca
in
particular
targeted
non-combatants
,
and
reports
state
that
30
such
individuals
were
slain
,
in
addition
to
a
number
of
armed
defenders
.


The
raiders
were
under
the
overall
command
of
Walter
Butler
,
who
exercised
little
authority
over
the
Indians
on
the
expedition
.


Historian
Barbara
Graymont
describes
Butler
's
command
of
the
expedition
as
``
criminally
incompetent
''
.


The
Seneca
were
angered
by
accusations
that
they
had
committed
atrocities
at
the
Battle
of
Wyoming
,
and
the
colonists
'
recent
destruction
of
their
forward
bases
of
operation
at
Unadilla
,
Onaquaga
,
and
Tioga
.


Butler
's
authority
with
the
Indians
was
undermined
by
his
poor
treatment
of
Joseph
Brant
,
the
leader
of
the
Mohawks
.


Butler
repeatedly
maintained
,
against
accusations
that
he
permitted
the
atrocities
to
take
place
,
that
he
was
powerless
to
restrain
the
Seneca
.


During
the
campaigns
of
1778
,
Brant
achieved
an
undeserved
reputation
for
brutality
.


He
was
not
present
at
Wyoming
—
although
many
thought
he
was
—
and
he
actively
sought
to
minimize
the
atrocities
that
took
place
at
Cherry
Valley
.


Diaries
belonging
to
British
soldiers
during
the
campaign
state
the
regiment
as
being
the
``
butchers
''
and
given
that
Butler
was
the
overall
commander
of
the
expedition
,
there
is
controversy
as
to
who
actually
ordered
or
failed
to
restrain
the
killings
.


The
massacre
contributed
to
calls
for
reprisals
,
leading
to
the
1779
Sullivan
Expedition
which
drove
the
Iroquois
out
of
western
New
York
.


The
Atlantic
campaign
of
May
1794
was
a
series
of
operations
conducted
by
the
British
Royal
Navy
's
Channel
Fleet
against
the
French
Navy
's
Atlantic
Fleet
,
with
the
aim
of
preventing
the
passage
of
a
strategically
important
French
grain
convoy
travelling
from
the
United
States
to
France
.


The
campaign
involved
commerce
raiding
by
detached
forces
and
two
minor
engagements
,
eventually
culminating
in
the
full
fleet
action
of
the
Glorious
First
of
June
1794
,
at
which
both
fleets
were
badly
mauled
and
both
Britain
and
France
claimed
victory
.


The
French
lost
seven
battleships
;
the
British
none
,
but
the
battle
distracted
the
British
fleet
long
enough
for
the
French
convoy
to
safely
reach
port
.


By
the
spring
of
1794
,
the
French
Republic
,
under
the
rule
of
the
National
Convention
,
was
at
war
with
all
its
neighbours
.


With
famine
imminent
,
the
French
Committee
of
Public
Safety
looked
to
France
's
colonies
and
the
United
States
to
provide
an
infusion
of
grain
;
this
was
to
be
convoyed
across
the
Atlantic
during
April
,
May
and
June
,
accompanied
by
a
small
escort
squadron
and
supported
by
a
second
,
larger
squadron
in
the
Bay
of
Biscay
.


However
,
political
upheaval
had
severely
reduced
the
French
Navy
's
ability
to
fight
coherently
and
supply
shortages
had
devastated
its
morale
,
significantly
weakening
the
fleet
.


Britain
,
by
contrast
,
was
at
a
high
state
of
readiness
with
a
well-organised
command
structure
,
but
was
suffering
from
a
severe
shortage
of
trained
seamen
with
which
to
man
its
large
navy
.


The
French
Atlantic
Fleet
,
under
Admiral
Villaret
de
Joyeuse
,
was
tasked
with
keeping
the
British
Channel
Fleet
occupied
long
enough
for
the
convoy
to
reach
France
safely
.


The
Channel
Fleet
,
commanded
by
Lord
Howe
,
knew
of
the
convoy
's
passage
,
and
dispatched
squadrons
to
protect
British
commerce
while
pursuing
Villaret
himself
with
the
main
body
of
the
Royal
Navy
's
Channel
Fleet
.


For
over
a
week
the
two
battlefleets
manoeuvred
around
one
another
,
Villaret
drawing
Howe
deeper
westwards
into
the
Atlantic
and
away
from
the
convoy
.


Two
partial
but
inconclusive
fleet
actions
on
28
and
29
May
followed
,
during
which
Howe
seized
the
weather
gage
from
Villaret
,
granting
him
freedom
to
choose
the
time
and
place
of
his
next
attack
.


The
culminating
action
of
the
campaign
took
place
over
into
the
Atlantic
,
and
became
known
as
the
Glorious
First
of
June
.


This
final
engagement
saw
Howe
use
the
weather
gage
to
attack
Villaret
directly
while
his
opponent
attempted
to
fight
in
a
traditional
line
of
battle
formation
.


In
the
battle
,
the
British
fleet
inflicted
a
heavy
defeat
on
the
French
after
a
bitterly
contested
day
of
fighting
.


Forcing
Villaret
to
retreat
,
Howe
's
force
captured
seven
French
battleships
,
one
of
which
later
sank
,
and
inflicted
7,000
casualties
on
the
enemy
.


Villaret
however
,
claimed
strategic
success
as
his
delaying
tactics
had
bought
enough
time
for
the
convoy
to
reach
France
safely
.


The
battle
was
the
first
in
a
series
of
defeats
the
French
Navy
suffered
during
the
early
years
of
the
war
,
which
bred
a
defeatist
attitude
and
an
unwillingness
among
the
French
officer
corps
to
engage
the
British
at
sea
.


Operation
Fustian
was
an
airborne
forces
operation
undertaken
during
the
Allied
invasion
of
Sicily
in
July
1943
in
the
Second
World
War
.


The
operation
was
carried
out
by
Brigadier
Gerald
Lathbury
's
1st
Parachute
Brigade
,
part
of
the
British
1st
Airborne
Division
.


Their
objective
was
the
Primosole
Bridge
across
the
Simeto
River
.


The
intention
was
for
the
brigade
,
with
glider-borne
forces
in
support
,
to
land
on
both
sides
of
the
river
.


They
would
then
capture
the
bridge
and
secure
the
surrounding
area
until
relieved
by
the
advance
of
British
XIII
Corps
,
which
had
landed
on
the
south
eastern
coast
three
days
previously
.


Because
the
bridge
was
the
only
crossing
on
the
river
and
would
give
the
British
Eighth
Army
access
to
the
Catania
plain
,
its
capture
was
expected
to
speed
the
advance
and
lead
to
the
defeat
of
the
Axis
forces
in
Sicily
.


Many
of
the
aircraft
carrying
the
paratroopers
from
North
Africa
were
shot
down
or
were
damaged
and
turned
back
by
friendly
fire
and
enemy
action
.


Evasive
action
taken
by
the
pilots
scattered
the
brigade
over
a
large
area
and
only
the
equivalent
of
two
companies
of
troops
were
landed
in
the
correct
locations
.


Despite
this
and
the
defence
by
German
and
Italian
forces
,
the
British
paratroops
captured
the
bridge
,
repulsed
attacks
and
held
out
against
increasing
odds
until
nightfall
.


The
relief
force
led
by
the
50th
(
Northumbrian
)
Infantry
Division
,
under
Major-General
Sidney
C.
Kirkman
,
which
was
short
of
transport
,
were
still
away
when
they
halted
for
the
night
.


By
this
time
,
with
casualties
mounting
and
supplies
running
short
,
the
parachute
brigade
commander
,
Gerald
Lathbury
,
had
relinquished
control
of
the
bridge
to
the
Germans
.


The
following
day
the
British
units
joined
forces
and
the
9th
Battalion
,
Durham
Light
Infantry
,
with
tank
support
,
attempted
to
recapture
the
bridge
.


The
bridge
was
not
finally
secured
until
three
days
after
the
start
of
the
operation
,
when
another
battalion
of
the
Durham
Light
Infantry
,
led
by
the
paratroopers
,
established
a
bridgehead
on
the
north
bank
of
the
river
.


The
capture
of
Primosole
Bridge
did
not
lead
to
the
expected
rapid
advance
,
as
by
this
time
the
Germans
had
gathered
their
forces
and
established
a
defensive
line
.


It
was
not
until
early
the
following
month
that
the
Eighth
Army
captured
Catania
.


By
this
time
the
1st
Parachute
Brigade
had
been
withdrawn
to
Malta
and
took
no
further
part
in
the
conquest
of
Sicily
.


Lessons
were
learned
from
the
operation
and
were
put
into
practice
in
Allied
airborne
operations
.

for
testing
out
some
of
the
thermonuclear
components
that
would
be
used
for
the
massive
thermonuclear
series
of
Operation

British
nuclear
tests
at
Maralinga
occurred
between
1956
and
1963
at
the
Maralinga
site
,
part
of
the
Woomera
Prohibited
Area
in
South
Australia
and
about
800
kilometres
north-west
of
Adelaide
.


A
total
of
seven
nuclear
tests
were
performed
,
with
approximate
yields
ranging
from
.


Two
major
test
series
were
conducted
at
the
Maralinga
site
:
``
Operation
Buffalo
''
and
``
Operation
Antler
''
.


The
site
was
also
used
for
hundreds
of
minor
trials
,
many
of
which
were
intended
to
investigate
the
effects
of
fire
or
non-nuclear
explosions
on
atomic
weapons
.


The
site
was
contaminated
with
radioactive
materials
and
an
initial
cleanup
was
attempted
in
1967
.


the
mcclelland
royal
commission
,
an
examination
of
the
effects
of
the
tests
,
delivered
its
report
in
1985
,
and
found
that
significant
radiation
hazards
still
existed
at
many
of
the
maralinga
test
areas
.


It
recommended
another
cleanup
,
which
was
completed
in
2000
at
a
cost
of
$
108
million
.


Debate
continued
over
the
safety
of
the
site
and
the
long-term
health
effects
on
the
traditional
Aboriginal
custodians
of
the
land
and
former
personnel
.


In
1994
,
the
Australian
Government
paid
compensation
amounting
to
$
13.5
million
to
the
local
Maralinga
Tjarutja
people
.


The
Maralinga
tests
were
subject
to
extreme
secrecy
,
but
by
the
late
1970s
there
was
a
marked
change
in
how
the
Australian
media
covered
the
British
nuclear
tests
.


Some
journalists
investigated
the
subject
and
political
scrutiny
became
more
intense
.


Journalist
Brian
Toohey
ran
a
series
of
stories
in
the
``
Australian
Financial
Review
''
in
October
1978
,
based
in
part
on
a
leaked
Cabinet
submission
.


In
June
1993
,
``
New
Scientist
''
journalist
Ian
Anderson
wrote
an
article
titled
``

that

misfired
by
the
French

official
report
.


This
rejected
the
suggestion
of
any
missile
strike
,
basing
its
findings
on
the
aircraft
's
survival
time
after
the
pilot
's
initial
report
to
air
traffic
control
of
a
fire
on
board
,
the
examination
of
the
wreckage
recovered
from
the

,
knowledge
of
a
similar
accidental
fire
in

Sud

the
declaration
by
the
French
defence
ministry
that
there
were
no
surface
ships
in
the
area
capable
of
launching
missiles
.


The
report
surmised
that
the
loss
of

had
been
caused
by
a
fire
in
the

On
3
December
2012
,
Belfast
City
Council
voted
to
limit
the
days
that
the
Union
Flag
(
the
flag
of
the
United
Kingdom
)
flies
from
Belfast
City
Hall
.


since
1906
,
the
flag
had
been
flown
every
day
of
the
year
.


This
was
changed
to
no
more
than
18
days
a
year
,
which
is
in
line
with
British
government
guidelines
regarding
government
buildings
.


the
move
to
limit
the
number
of
days
was
backed
by
the
council
's
irish
nationalists
and
the
alliance
party
;
it
was
opposed
by
the
unionist
councillors
.


As
a
response
,
Ulster
loyalists
held
street
protests
throughout
Northern
Ireland
.


They
see
the
Council
's
decision
as
part
of
a
wider
'cultural
war
'
against
'Britishness
'
in
Northern
Ireland
.


On
the
night
of
the
vote
,
protesters
tried
to
storm
City
Hall
.


Throughout
December
and
January
,
protests
were
held
almost
daily
and
most
involved
the
protesters
blocking
roads
while
carrying
Union
Flags
and
banners
.


Some
of
these
protests
led
to
clashes
between
loyalists
and
the
police
,
sparking
riots
.


Rioters
attacked
police
with
petrol
bombs
,
bricks
,
stones
and
fireworks
;
police
responded
with
plastic
bullets
and
water
cannon
.


alliance
party
offices
and
the
homes
of
alliance
party
members
were
attacked
,
while
belfast
city
councillors
were
sent
death
threats
.


according
to
police
,
some
of
the
violence
was
orchestrated
by
high-ranking
members
of
the
ulster
volunteer
force
(
uvf
)
and
ulster
defence
association
(
uda
)
.


Loyalists
also
put
up
thousands
of
Union
flags
in
public
places
,
which
further
heightened
tension
.


After
February
2013
,
the
protests
have
been
smaller
and
less
frequent
,
and
have
led
to
greater
loyalist
protests
about
related
issues
,
such
as
restrictions
on
traditional
loyalist
marches
.


Hurricane
Nate
caused
minor
damage
in
southeastern
Mexico
in
mid-September
2011
.


The
sixteenth
named
storm
and
fourth
hurricane
of
the
2011
Atlantic
hurricane
season
,
Nate
originated
from
a
frontal
trough
in
the
Bay
of
Campeche
on
September
7
.


Within
a
weak
steering
environment
,
the
storm
meandered
southwestward
while
gradually
gaining
strength
.


though
classified
as
a
tropical
storm
operationally
,
data
during
a
post-season
review
indicated
that
nate
briefly
attained
category
1
hurricane
status
on
the
unk
hurricane
wind
scale
on
september
8
.


As
a
result
of
its
slow
motion
,
the
storm
caused
significant
upwelling
,
leading
to
a
marked
decrease
in
convection
,
and
weakening
accordingly
.


On
September
11
,
Nate
moved
ashore
Mexico
as
a
tropical
storm
,
producing
several
inches
of
rainfall
and
damaging
several
hundred
structures
.


Ten
oil

workers
went
missing
;
seven
were
rescued

Photographer
of
Dreams
(
Russian
:
Фотограф

)
is
a
concert
tour
programme
of
Russian
pop
star
Valery
Leontiev
,
which
was
performed
in
Russia
,
Ukraine
,
Germany
,
Israel
,
and
the
U.S
.


The
official
premiere
of
the
show
was
held
in
March
1999
in
St.
Petersburg
.


The
producer
was
Alex
Garnizov
.


The
program
was
born
in
Moscow
in
December
1998
.


The
official
premiere
of
the
show
was
held
in
St.
Petersburg
,
in
March
1999
in
Oktyabrskiy
Big
Concert
Hall
.


It
was
a
super-show
based
on
the
songs
of
the
Moscow
composer
Vladimir
Evzerov
.


The
format
was
different
from
past
shows
of
the
singer
,
so
that
the
actor
had
decided
to
use
laser
pyrotechnics
,
that
decorate
the
program
.


In
the
form
of
decorations
on
the
stage
,
there
were
three
huge
screens
,
framed
by
intricate
attributes
,
thereby
giving
the
camera
view
.


On
the
screens
were
shown
scenes
of
the
songs
.


During
the
song
``
Santa
Barbara
''
,
flashed
the
endless
waters
of
the
Pacific
Ocean
.


At
the
``
Coco
Chanel
''
,
appeared
in
Mademoiselle
herself
,
surrounded
by
the
sights
of
Paris
,
but
to
the
song
``
Queen
destiny
''
,
the
entire
screen
appeared
as
the
face
of
the
singer
,
prompting
a
storm
of
enthusiasm
in
the
hall
.


It
is
said
that
the
sole
sponsor
of
all
,
was
Leontiev
himself
.


After
the
premiere
show
in
Moscow
,
``
Photographer
of
Dreams
''
rolled
off
the
cities
of
Russia
and
Ukraine
,
visited
Germany
,
the
US
and
Israel
.


Everywhere
,
the
audience
was
a
full
house
.


The
TV
version
held
on

In
1999
,
the

''
was
awarded
to
the
program
for
best
show
of
the
year

The
1938
New
England
Hurricane
(
also
referred
to
as
the
Great
New
England
Hurricane
,
Long
Island
Express
,
and
Yankee
Clipper
)
was
one
of
the
deadliest
and
most
destructive
tropical
cyclones
to
strike
Long
Island
,
New
York
,
and
New
England
.


The
storm
formed
near
the
coast
of
Africa
on
September
9
,
becoming
a
Category
5
hurricane
on
the
Saffir-Simpson
Hurricane
Scale
,
before
making
landfall
as
a
Category
3
hurricane
on
Long
Island
on
September
21
.


It
is
estimated
that
the
hurricane
killed
682
people
,
damaged
or
destroyed
more
than
57,000
homes
,
and
caused
property
losses
estimated
at
$
306
million
(
$
4.7
billion
in
2017
)
.


Damaged
trees
and
buildings
were
still
seen
in
the
affected
areas
as
late
as
1951
.


It
remains
the
most
powerful
and
deadliest
hurricane
in
recorded
New
England
history
,
perhaps
eclipsed
in
landfall
intensity
only
by
the
Great
Colonial
Hurricane
of
1635
.


at
the
time
,
roughly
half
of
the
1938
new
england
hurricane
's
existence
went
unnoticed
.


The
Atlantic
hurricane
reanalysis
in
2013
concluded
that
the
storm
developed
into
a
tropical
depression
on
September
9
off
the
coast
of
West
Africa
,
but
the
United
States
Weather
Bureau
was
unaware
that
a
tropical
cyclone
existed
until
September
16
;
by
then
,
it
was
already
a
well-developed
hurricane
and
had
tracked
westward
toward
the
Sargasso
Sea
.


It
reached
hurricane
strength
on
September
15
and
continued
to
strengthen
to
a
peak
intensity
of
160
mph
(
260
km/h
)
near
the
Bahamas
four
days
later
,
making
it
a
Category
5-equivalent
hurricane
.


The
storm
was
propelled
northward
,
rapidly
paralleling
the
East
Coast
before
making
landfalls
on
Long
Island
and
Connecticut
as
a
Category
3-equivalent
hurricane
on
September
21
.


After
moving
inland
,
it
transitioned
into
an
extratropical
cyclone
and
dissipated
over
Ontario
on
September
23
.


The
2012
Afyonkarahisar
arsenal
explosion
occurred
at
21:15
local
time
on
5
September
2012
in
Afyonkarahisar
,
Turkey
.


according
to
turkish
armed
forces
,
25
servicemen
died
,
four
other
soldiers
and
three
civilians
were
injured
by
the
accident
.


A
fire
at
the
locality
followed
the
explosion
.


The
remains
of
two
noncommissioned
officers
,
two
special
sergeants
and
21
privates
were
recovered
after
the
fire
was
extinguished
.


The
explosion
occurred
during
classification
works
in
the
depot
.


Ammunition
was
transported
from
a
depot
of
the
44th
Ammunition
Company
in
Susurluk
,
Balıkesir
to
Afyonkarahisar
by
train
,
and
from
the
train
station
in
the
city
to
the
facility
by
civilian
trucks
.


The
arsenal
commander
ordered
the
completion
of
tally
and
classification
works
before
a
scheduled
official
inspection
in
ten
days
time
.


For
that
reason
,
works
in
the
depot
continued
in
the
night
although
any
work
in
the
arsenal
depots
is
not
allowed
in
the
darkness
due
to
lack
of
lighting
in
those
facilities
.


During
the
accident
time
,
the
depot
's
inside
was
being
illuminated
by
the
light
beam
from
the
headlamps
of
a
truck
parked
before
the
depot
gate
,
by
flashlights
and
possibly
by
lighters
.


The
reason
for
the
explosion
was
thought
to
be
that
one
of
grenades
exploded
accidentally
and
others
exploded
sequentially
.


Military
authorities
said
that
soldiers
tallied
in
the
arsenal
depot
since
a
couple
of
days
.


The
Prime
Minister
announced
that
four
commanders
of
the
facility
were
removed
from
their
post
and
appointed
to
other
military
units
.


The
depot
no
.


32
,
at
which
the
explosion
took
place
,
was
within
the
41st
Ammunition
Company
of
the
4th
Munition
Division
at
the
500th
Arsenal
Command
of
the
Turkish
Army
Corps
of
Engineers
.


The
officers
stationed
at
the
site
told
during
the
hearing
before
the
military
prosecutor
that
248
tonnes
hand
grenades
and
360
tonnes
ammunition
were
tried
to
be
piled
in
two
depots
instead
of
in
five
depots
as
required
.


the
investigation
was
carried
out
by
a
military
prosecutor
from
the
1st
tactical
air
force
command
in
UNK
,
which
is
in
command
of
the
facility
in
afyonkarahisar
.


The
military
court
ruled
the
detention
of
a
major
,
and
the
trial
of
two
other
officers
in
the
rank
of
a
colonel
and
a
first
lieutenant
without
arrest
.


The
major
is
accused
of
involuntary
manslaughter
.


The
military
prosecutor
stated
that
no
evidence
could
be
found
showing
that
the
explosion
was
a
result
of
terrorism
or
sabotage
.


The
Bhopal
disaster
,
also
referred
to
as
the
Bhopal
gas
tragedy
,
was
a
gas
leak
incident
on
the
night
of
2–3
December
1984
at
the
Union
Carbide
India
Limited
(
UCIL
)
pesticide
plant
in
Bhopal
,
Madhya
Pradesh
,
India
.


It
is
considered
to
be
the
world
's
worst
industrial
disaster
.


over
500,000
people
were
exposed
to
methyl
isocyanate
(
mic
)
gas
.


The
highly
toxic
substance
made
its
way
into
and
around
the
small
towns
located
near
the
plant
.


Estimates
vary
on
the
death
toll
.


The
official
immediate
death
toll
was
2,259
.


The
government
of
Madhya
Pradesh
confirmed
a
total
of
3,787
deaths
related
to
the
gas
release
.


A
government
affidavit
in
2006
stated
that
the
leak
caused
558,125
injuries
,
including
38,478
temporary
partial
injuries
and
approximately
3,900
severely
and
permanently
disabling
injuries
.


Others
estimate
that
8,000
died
within
two
weeks
,
and
another
8,000
or
more
have
since
died
from
gas-related
diseases
.


The
cause
of
the
disaster
remains
under
debate
.


The
Indian
government
and
local
activists
argue
that
slack
management
and
deferred
maintenance
created
a
situation
where
routine
pipe
maintenance
caused
a
backflow
of
water
into
a
MIC
tank
,
triggering
the
disaster
.


Union
Carbide
Corporation
(
UCC
)
argues
water
entered
the
tank
through
an
act
of
sabotage
.


The
owner
of
the
factory
,
UCIL
,
was
majority
owned
by
UCC
,
with
Indian
Government-controlled
banks
and
the
Indian
public
holding
a
49.1
percent
stake
.


In
1989
,
UCC
paid
$
470
million
(
equivalent
to
$
in
)
to
settle
litigation
stemming
from
the
disaster
.


In
1994
,
UCC
sold
its
stake
in
UCIL
to
Eveready
Industries
India
Limited
(
EIIL
)
,
which
subsequently
merged
with
McLeod
Russel
(
India
)
Ltd.
Eveready
ended
clean-up
on
the
site
in
1998
,
when
it
terminated
its
99-year
lease
and
turned
over
control
of
the
site
to
the
state
government
of
Madhya
Pradesh
.


Dow
Chemical
Company
purchased
UCC
in
2001
,
seventeen
years
after
the
disaster
.


Civil
and
criminal
cases
filed
in
the
United
States
against
UCC
and
Warren
Anderson
,
UCC
CEO
at
the
time
of
the
disaster
,
were
dismissed
and
redirected
to
Indian
courts
on
multiple
occasions
between
1986
and
2012
,
as
the
US
courts
focused
on
UCIL
being
a
standalone
entity
of
India
.


Civil
and
criminal
cases
were
also
filed
in
the
District
Court
of
Bhopal
,
India
,
involving
UCC
,
UCIL
and
UCC
CEO
Anderson
.


In
June
2010
,
seven
Indian
nationals
who
were
UCIL
employees
in
1984
,
including
the
former
UCIL
chairman
,
were
convicted
in
Bhopal
of
causing
death
by
negligence
and
sentenced
to
two
years
imprisonment
and
a
fine
of
about
$
2,000
each
,
the
maximum
punishment
allowed
by
Indian
law
.


All
were
released
on
bail
shortly
after
the
verdict
.


An
eighth
former
employee
was
also
convicted
,
but
died
before
the
judgement
was
passed
.


cyclone
forrest
,
also
referred

storm
forrest
,
was
a
powerful
tropical
cyclone
that
prompted
the
evacuation
of
600,000
people
in
bangladesh
in
late
november
1992
.


Originating
from
an
area
of
disturbed
weather
near
the
Caroline
Islands
on
November
9
,
Forrest
was
classified
as
a
tropical
depression
three
days
later
over
the
South
China
Sea
.


Tracking
generally
west
,
the
system
steadily
organized
into
a
tropical
storm
,
passing
Vietnam
to
the
south
,
before
striking
Thailand
along
the
Malay
Peninsula
on
November
15
.


Once
over
the
Bay
of
Bengal
,
Forrest
turned
northward
on
November
17
and
significantly
intensified
.


It
reached
its
peak
intensity
on
November
20
as
a
Category
4-equivalent
cyclone
on
the
Saffir–Simpson
hurricane
scale
with
winds
of
230
km/h
(

.


Hostile
environmental
conditions

cyclone
as
it
turned
abruptly
east-northeastward
.


Forrest
made
landfall
in
northwestern
Myanmar
as
a
weakening
system
on
November
21
before
dissipating
early
the
next
day
.


The
majority
of
deaths
associated
with
Forrest
resulted
from
a
plane
crash
on
November
14
in
Vietnam
which
killed
30
of
the
31
occupants
.


In
Thailand
,
the
system
produced
significant
storm
surge
,
damaged
or
destroyed
1,700
homes
,
and
killed
two
people
.


Agricultural
losses
in
the
hardest
hit
areas
were
estimated
at
฿800
million
(
US
$
32
million
)
.


On
November
20
,
as
Forrest
reached
its
peak
intensity
,
fears
arose
across
Bangladesh
that
a
repeat
of
the
catastrophic
April
1991
cyclone
would
take
place
.


As
a
result
,
mass
evacuation
plans
were
enacted
across
coastal
areas
of
the
country
,
with
plans
to
relocate
up
to
2
million
people
.


But
the
storm
abruptly
turned
eastward
,
and
the
successful
evacuation
of
600,000
residents
spared
countless
lives
.


Only
two
deaths
were
recorded
and
overall
damage
was
light
,
though
half
of
all
homes
on
St.
Martin
's
Island
were
damaged
.


The
Bishops
'
Wars
of
1639
and
1640
are
generally
viewed
as
the
starting
point
of
the
1639–1652
Wars
of
the
Three
Kingdoms
that
ultimately
involved
the
whole
of
the
British
Isles
.


They
originated
in
long-standing
disputes
over
control
and
governance
of
the
Church
of
Scotland
or
kirk
that
went
back
to
the
1580s
.


These
came
to
a
head
in
1637
when
Charles
I
attempted
to
impose
uniform
practices
between
the
kirk
and
the
Church
of
England
.


Charles
favoured
an
episcopal
system
,
or
rule
by
bishops
,
while
the
majority
of
Scots
advocated
a
presbyterian
system
,
without
bishops
.


the
1638
national
covenant
pledged
to
oppose
these
unk
'
and
the
general
assembly
of
the
church
of
scotland
voted
to
expel
bishops
from
the
kirk
.


When
Charles
resorted
to
force
,
the
Covenanters
defeated
Royalist
forces
in
Aberdeenshire
in
1639
,
then
an
English
army
in
1640
,
leaving
them
in
control
of
Scotland
.


On
the
night
of
14–15
April
2014
,
276
female
students
were
kidnapped
from
the
Government
Secondary
School
in
the
town
of
Chibok
in
Borno
State
,
Nigeria
.


Responsibility
for
the
kidnappings
was
claimed
by
Boko
Haram
,
an
extremist
terrorist
organization
based
in
northeastern
Nigeria
.


57
of
the
schoolgirls
managed
to
escape
over
the
next
few
months
and
some
have
described
their
capture
in
appearances
at
international
human
rights
conferences
.


A
child
born
to
one
of
the
girls
and
believed
by
medical
personnel
to
be
about
20
months
old
also
was
released
,
according
to
the
Nigerian
president
's
office
.


since
then
hopes
were
raised
on
various
occasions
that
the
219
remaining
girls
might
be
released
.


Newspaper
reports
suggested
that
Boko
Haram
was
hoping
to
use
the
girls
as
negotiating
pawns
in
exchange
for
some
of
their
commanders
in
jail
.


In
May
2016
,
one
of
the
missing
girls
,
Amina
Ali
,
was
found
.


She
claimed
that
the
remaining
girls
were
still
there
,
but
that
six
had
died
.


A
further
21
girls
were
freed
in
October
2016
,
while
another
was
rescued
the
next
month
.


Another
was
found
in
January
2017
.


82
more
girls
were
freed
in
May
2017
.


One
of
the
girls
was
rescued
in
January
2018
.


The
Dutch–Venezuelan
crisis
of
1908
was
a
dispute
that
broke
out
between
the
Netherlands
and
Venezuela
after
the
Venezuelan
president
,
Cipriano
Castro
,
cut
off
trade
with
the
Dutch
island
of
Curaçao
on
the
grounds
that
it
was
harbouring
political
refugees
from
Venezuela
.


Venezuela
expelled
the
Dutch
ambassador
,
prompting
a
Dutch
dispatch
of
three
warships
:
,
,
and
.


The
Dutch
warships
had
orders
to
intercept
every
ship
that
was
sailing
under
the
Venezuelan
flag
.


On
12
December
,
``
Gelderland
''
captured
the
Venezuelan
coast
guard
ship
``
Alix
''
off
Puerto
Cabello
.


She
and
another
ship
,
``
23
de
Mayo
''
,
were
interned
in
harbor
of
Willemstad
.


With
their
overwhelming
naval
superiority
,
the
Dutch
enforced
a
blockade
on
Venezuela
's
ports
.


A
few
days
later
,
President
Castro
left
for
Berlin
,
nominally
for
a
surgical
operation
.


In
his
absence
,
Vice
President
Juan
Vicente
Gómez
with
the
support
of
the
U.S.
Navy
seized
power
in
Caracas
,
and
on
19
December
1908
,
installed
Gómez
himself
as
de
facto
president
,
and
ended
the
war
with
the
Netherlands
.


The
Battle
of
Rowton
Heath
,
also
known
as
the
Battle
of
Rowton
Moor
,
occurred
on
24
September
1645
during
the
English
Civil
War
.


Fought
by
the
Parliamentarians
,
commanded
by
Sydnam
Poyntz
,
and
the
Royalists
under
the
personal
command
of
King
Charles
I
,
it
was
a
significant
defeat
for
the
Royalists
,
with
heavy
losses
and
Charles
prevented
from
relieving
the
Siege
of
Chester
.


Prior
to
the
battle
,
Charles
had
been
attempting
to
link
up
with
the
Marquess
of
Montrose
in
Scotland
following
the
Royalist
defeat
in
the
Battle
of
Naseby
.


although
his
attempts
to
do
so
were
unsuccessful
,
they
were
disruptive
enough
that
the
committee
of
both
kingdoms
ordered
unk
poyntz
to
pursue
the
king
with
approximately
3,000
horse
.


After
Charles
was
informed
that
Chester
,
his
only
remaining
port
,
was
under
siege
,
he
marched
there
with
the
intent
of
relieving
the
defenders
,
ordering
3,000
horse
under
the
command
of
Marmaduke
Langdale
to
camp
outside
the
city
while
he
and
600
others
travelled
into
Chester
itself
on
23
September
1645
.


The
intent
was
to
attack
the
besieging
Parliamentarians
from
both
sides
,
Charles
mistakenly
believing
that
Poyntz
had
failed
to
follow
them
.


In
fact
he
was
barely
behind
,
and
moved
to
attack
Langdale
's
force
in
the
early
hours
of
24
September
.


although
langdale
drove
poyntz
off
,
the
parliamentarians
besieging
chester
sent
reinforcements
,
and
langdale
was
forced
to
retreat
to
rowton
heath
,
closer
to
chester
,
and
wait
for
his
own
reinforcements
.


This
force
,
under
Charles
Gerard
and
Lord
Bernard
Stewart
,
was
prevented
from
joining
them
,
and
Langdale
was
instead
attacked
by
both
Poyntz
's
force
and
the
reinforcement
.


After
being
driven
off
the
field
and
failing
in
an
attempt
to
regroup
at
Chester
itself
,
the
Royalists
retreated
as
dusk
fell
.


Royalist
casualties
were
high
,
with
600
killed
,
including
Stewart
,
and
900
taken
prisoner
.


This
defeat
prevented
Charles
from
relieving
the
defenders
in
Chester
,
which
fell
to
the
Parliamentarians
on
3
February
1646
.


Charles
instead
withdrew
with
approximately
2,400
remaining
cavalry
,
most
of
whom
were
destroyed
by
Poyntz
's
ambush
at
Sherburn-in-Elmet
on
15
October
1645
.

,

won
the
match
1–0

alongside
captain
John
Terry
,
and
Loïc
Rémy
started
up-front
as

.


The
only
goal
of
the
match
came
near
the

point
of
the
first
half
;
Alex
Oxlade-Chamberlain
collected
a
pass
from
Theo
Walcott
from
the
right
and
scored
past
Thibaut
Courtois
.


Both
managers
did
not
shake
hands
after

The
1984
anti-Sikh
riots
,
was
a
series
of
organised
communal
riots
against
Sikhs
in
India
in
response
to
the
assassination
of
Indira
Gandhi
by
her
Sikh
bodyguards
.


The
then
ruling
party
,
Indian
National
Congress
had
been
in
active
complicity
with
the
mob
,
as
to
the
organisation
of
the
riots
.


Independent
sources
estimate
the
number
of
deaths
at
about
8,000–17,000
whilst
government
estimates
project
that
about
2,800
Sikhs
were
killed
in
Delhi
and
3,350
nationwide
.


Violence
continued
in
the
early
1980s
due
to
the
armed
Sikh
separatist
Khalistan
movement
which
sought
independence
from
India
.


In
July
1982
,
the
Sikh
political
party
Akali
Dal
's
President
Harchand
Singh
Longowal
had
invited
Jarnail
Singh
Bhindranwale
to
take
up
residence
in
Golden
Temple
Complex
to
evade
arrest
.


Bhindranwale
later
on
made
the
sacred
temple
complex
an
armoury
and
headquarters
.


In
the
violent
events
leading
up
to
the
Operation
Blue
Star
since
the
inception
of
Akali
Dharm
Yudh
Morcha
,
the
militants
had
killed
165
Hindus
and
Nirankaris
,
even
39
Sikhs
opposed
to
Bhindranwale
were
killed
.


The
total
number
of
deaths
was
410
in
violent
incidents
and
riots
while
1,180
people
were
injured
.


Operation
Blue
Star
was
an
Indian
military
operation
carried
out
between
1
and
8
June
1984
,
ordered
by
Prime
Minister
Indira
Gandhi
to
remove
militant
religious
leader
Jarnail
Singh
Bhindranwale
and
his
armed
militants
from
the
buildings
of
the
Harmandir
Sahib
complex
in
Amritsar
,
Punjab
.


Bhindranwale
died
and
militants
were
removed
from
the
temple
complex
.


The
military
action
in
the
temple
complex
was
criticized
by
Sikhs
worldwide
who
had
interpreted
it
as
an
assault
on
Sikh
religion
.


Four
months
after
the
operation
,
on
31
October
1984
,
Indira
Gandhi
was
assassinated
in
vengeance
by
her
two
Sikh
bodyguards
,
Satwant
Singh
and
Beant
Singh
.


Public
outcry
over
Gandhi
's
death
led
to
the
killings
of
Sikhs
in
the
ensuing
riots
.


In
the
aftermath
of
the
riots
,
the
government
reported
that
20,000
had
fled
the
city
;
the
People
's
Union
for
Civil
Liberties
reported
``
at
least
''
1,000
displaced
persons
.


The
most-affected
regions
were
the
Sikh
neighbourhoods
of
Delhi
.


Human
rights
organisations
and
newspapers
across
India
believed
that
the
massacre
was
organised
.


The
collusion
of
political
officials
in
the
violence
and
judicial
failure
to
penalise
the
perpetrators
alienated
Sikhs
and
increased
support
for
the
Khalistan
movement.

The
Akal
Takht
,
Sikhism
's

body
,
considers
the
killings
genocide
.


In

,
Human
Rights
Watch
reported
that
the
Government
of
India
had
``
yet
to
prosecute
those
responsible
for
the
mass
killings
''
.


According
to
the
2011
WikiLeaks
cable
leaks
,
the
United
States
was
convinced
of
Indian
National
Congress
'
complicity
in
the
riots
and
called
it
``
opportunism
''
and
``
hatred
''
by
the
Congress
government
,
of
Sikhs
.


although
the
u.s.
has
not
identified
the
riots
as
genocide
,
it
acknowledged
that
``
grave
human
rights
violations
''
occurred
.


In
2011
,
a
new
group
of
mass
graves
was
discovered
in
Haryana
and
Human
Rights
Watch
reported
that
``
widespread
anti-Sikh

''
in
India
.


The
Central
Bureau
of

investigative
agency
,
believes
that
the
violence
was
organised
with
support
from
the

The
MDNA
Tour
was
the
ninth
concert
tour
by
American
singer-songwriter
Madonna
.


It
showcased
material
from
her
twelfth
studio
album
,
``
MDNA
''
(
2012
)
.


Comprising
88
shows
,
the
tour
visited
the
Americas
,
Europe
,
and
the
Middle
East
.


This
marked
the
singer
's
first
performances
in
the
United
Arab
Emirates
,
Ukraine
,
Scotland
,
and
Colombia
.


The
tour
was
initially
planned
to
reach
Australia
in
January
2013
but
was
cancelled
;
Madonna
apologized
through
a
video
letter
on
her
official
YouTube
account
.


Madonna
described
the
tour
as
``
the
journey
of
a
soul
from
darkness
to
light
''
.


It
was
divided
into
four
sections
:
``
Transgression
''
,
where
guns
and
violence
was
the
main
theme
,
``
Prophecy
''
,
where
a
mix
of
joyful
songs
that
bring
people
together
are
performed
,
``
Masculine/Feminine
''
,
a
combination
of
sensuality
and
fashion
with
a
few
of
Madonna
's
classic
songs
performed
in
a
French
Cabaret-style
,
and
``
Redemption
''
,
which
Madonna
labeled
as
``
a
big
party
and
celebration
''
.


The
tour
has
received
mostly
positive
reception
from
critics
.


The
tour
courted
many
controversial
subjects
such
as
violence
,
firearms
,
human
rights
,
nudity
,
and
politics
.


Lawsuits
threatened
against
Madonna
have
also
been
engaged
from
the
tour
.


The
MDNA
Tour
created
immense
success
at
the
box
office
and
many
venues
were
instantly
sold
out
.


It
was
dubbed
as
the
highest-grossing
tour
of
2012
by
``
Billboard
''
.


The
tour
grossed
$
305.2
million
from
88
sold-out
shows
,
becoming
the
tenth
highest-grossing
tour
of
all
time
and
surpassing
Celine
Dion
's
Taking
Chances
World
Tour
as
the
second
highest-grossing
tour
among
female
artists
,
behind
Madonna
's
own
Sticky
&
Sweet
Tour
.


Madonna
broke
the
record
for
occupying
the
top
two
highest-grossing
female
tours
of
all
time

Madonna
accepted
the
Top
Touring
Artist

described
the
June

as
the
biggest
in
peacetime

The
Environment
Agency
described
the
July
floods
as
critical
and
expected
them
to
exceed
the
1947
benchmark
.

World
Ice
Hockey

Hockey
Federation
(

Teams
representing

teams
competed
in
an
exhibition
tournament
to
gain
experience
before
joining
on
an
official
basis
in
the

also
served

being
split

best

where
they

21st
time
.


Before
dawn
on
January
30
,
1964
,
General
Nguyễn
Khánh
ousted
the
military
junta
led
by
General
Dương
Văn
Minh
from
the
leadership
of
South
Vietnam
without
firing
a
shot
.


It
came
less
than
three
months
after
Minh
's
junta
had
themselves
come
to
power
in
a
bloody
coup
against
then
President
Ngô
Đình
Diệm
.


The
coup
was
bloodless
and
took
less
than
a
few
hours—after
power
had
been
seized
Minh
's
aide
and
bodyguard
,
Major
Nguyễn
Văn
Nhung
was
arrested
and
summarily
executed
.


Distrusted
by
his
colleagues
because
of
his
tendency
to
change
sides
and
his
reputation
as
an
intriguer
,
Khánh
was
assigned
to
I
Corps
in
the
far
north
of
the
country
after
Diệm
's
overthrow
to
keep
him
away
from
the
capital
Saigon
.


Khánh
,
who
had
played
a
minor
role
in
Diệm
's
overthrow
,
joined
forces
with
Generals
Trần
Thiện
Khiêm
,
Nguyễn
Văn
Thiệu
,
who
felt
they
deserved
better
posts
in
the
junta
,
and
Colonels
Nguyễn
Chánh
Thi
and
Đỗ
Mậu
,
the
latter
being
the
director
of
military
security
under
Diệm
and
an
effective
strategist
.


During
the
three
months
of
his
rule
,
Minh
,
his
civilian
Prime
Minister
Nguyễn
Ngọc
Thơ
,
and
his
leading
military
colleagues
,
Generals
Trần
Văn
Đôn
and
Lê
Văn
Kim
,
attempted
to
defeat
the
National
Liberation
Front
(
Viet
Cong
)
non-militarily
.


They
felt
that
a
battleground
victory
was
impractical
or
impossible
and
pursued
a
strategy
of
trying
to
politically
integrate
the
insurgents
into
the
mainstream
.


This
meant
an
intensification
of
rural
non-military
initiatives
and
a
reduction
in
armed
operations
.


This
brought
them
into
conflict
with
the
United
States
,
who
had
plans
to
start
bombing
North
Vietnam
.


at
the
same
time
,
in
january
1964
,
the
french
government
of
president
charles
de
gaulle
proposed
the
neutralization
of
vietnam
and
the
withdrawal
of
american
forces
.


Khánh
and
his
fellow
plotters
exploited
this
to
spread
rumors
that
Minh
's
junta
was
about
to
make
a
deal
with
Hanoi
and
then
gained
the
support
of
the
US
,
most
notably
through
the
chief
of
military
forces
in
Vietnam
,
General
Paul
Harkins
,
who
supported
Diệm
and
opposed
Minh
's
November
coup
.


Before
dawn
on
January
30
,
the
coup
forces
caught
the
junta
completely
off-guard
and
seized
power
without
a
fight
.


Khánh
grudgingly
decided
to
keep
Minh
as
a
figurehead
chief
of
state
while
maintaining
real
power
in
his
hands
as
Minh
was
popular
within
the
army
and
the
Americans
wanted
a
show
of
unity
to
be
maintained
.


Khánh
also
tried
to
consolidate
his
standing
in
the
military
by
promoting
a
group
of
younger
officers
,
and
increasing
the
pay
of
the
enlisted
men
.


in
the
meantime
,
the
other
key
generals
in
the
junta
,
don
,
kim
,
unk
and
UNK
were
put
under
house
arrest
,
accused
by
UNK
of
attempting
to
negotiate
a
peace
deal
with
north
vietnam
.


However
,
when
they
were
brought
to
a
military
trial
presided
over
by
Khánh
,
the
junta
leader
did
not
provide
any
evidence
and
convicted
them
of
``
lax
morality
''
.


Khánh
then
allowed
them
back
to
meaningless
desk
jobs
,
but
the
show
trial
brought
him
much
embarrassment
.


Khánh
later
admitted
that
there
was
no
basis
to
the
charges
of
neutralism
against
the
four
generals
,
and
after
a
tumultuous
year
in
power
,
Khánh
was
himself
deposed
in
February
1965
and
forced
into
exile
.


Operation
Frankton
was
a
commando
raid
on
shipping
in
the
Nazi
German
occupied
French
port
of
Bordeaux
in
southwest
France
during
the
Second
World
War
.


The
raid
was
carried
out
by
a
small
unit
of
Royal
Marines
known
as
the
Royal
Marines
Boom
Patrol
Detachment
(
RMBPD
)
,
part
of
Combined
Operations
inserted
by
HMS
Tuna
(
N94
)
captained
by
Lieutenant-Commander
Dick
Raikes
who
,
earlier
,
had
been
awarded
the
DSO
for
operations
while
in
command
of
the
submarine
HMS
Seawolf
.


(
the
unk
would
later
form
the
special
boat
service
)
.


The
plan
was
for
six
kayaks
(
called
``
canoes
''
by
the
British
)
to
be
taken
to
the
area
of
the
Gironde
estuary
by
submarine
.


The
twelve
men
would
then
paddle
by
night
to
Bordeaux
.


On
arrival
they
would
attack
the
docked
cargo
ships
with
limpet
mines
and
then
escape
overland
to
Spain
.


Twelve
men
from
no.1
section
were
selected
for
the
raid
;
including
the
commanding
officer
,
Herbert
'Blondie
'
Hasler
,
and
with
the
reserve
Marine
Colley
the
total
of
the
team
numbered
thirteen
.


One
canoe
was
damaged
while
being
deployed
from
the
submarine
and
it
and
its
crew
therefore
could
not
take
part
in
the
mission
.


Only
two
of
the
10
men
who
launched
from
the
submarine
survived
the
raid
:
Hasler
,
and
his
no.2
in
the
canoe
,
Bill
Sparks
.


Of
the
other
eight
,
six
were
executed
by
the
Germans
while
two
died
from
hypothermia
.


The
Festival
della
canzone
italiana
di
Sanremo
(
in
English
:
``
Italian
song
festival
of
Sanremo
''
)
is
the
most
popular
Italian
song
contest
and
awards
,
held
annually
in
the
town
of
Sanremo
,
Liguria
,
and
consisting
of
a
competition
amongst
previously
unreleased
songs
.


Usually
referred
to
as
Festival
di
Sanremo
,
or
outside
Italy
as
Sanremo
Music
Festival
or
Sanremo
Music
Festival
Award
,
it
was
the
inspiration
for
the
Eurovision
Song
Contest
.


It
is
the
music
equivalent
to
the
``
Premio
Regia
Televisiva
''
for
television
,
the
``
Premio
Ubu
''
for
stage
performances
,
and
the
Premio
David
di
Donatello
for
motion
pictures
,
but
with
a
longer
history
and
contest
associated
with
.


The
first
edition
of
the
Sanremo
Music
Festival
,
held
between
29
and
31
January
1951
,
was
broadcast
by
RAI
's
radio
station
Rete
Rossa
and
its
only
three
participants
were
Nilla
Pizzi
,
Achille
Togliani
and
Duo
Fasano
.


Starting
from
1955
all
the
editions
of
the
Festival
have
been
broadcast
live
by
the
Italian
TV
station
Rai
1
.


From
1951
to
1976
,
the
Festival
took
place
in
the
Sanremo
Casino
,
but
starting
from
1977
,
all
the
following
editions
were
held
in
the
Teatro
Ariston
,
except
1990
's
one
,
held
at
the
Nuovo
Mercato
dei
Fiori
.


Between
1953
and
1971
,
except
in
1956
,
each
song
was
sung
twice
by
two
different
artists
,
each
one
using
an
individual
orchestral
arrangement
,
to
illustrate
the
meaning
of
the
festival
as
a
composers
'
competition
,
not
a
singers
'
competition
.


During
this
era
of
the
festival
,
it
was
custom
that
one
version
of
the
song
was
performed
by
a
native
Italian
artist
while
the
other
version
was
performed
by
an
international
guest
artist.
,
and
that
was
the
way
for
many
international
artists
to
debut
with
hits
in
Italian
market
in
those
years
,
such
a
case
for
Louis
Armstrong
,
Stevie
Wonder
,
Jose
Feliciano
,
Roberto
Carlos

The
1969
Gujarat
riots
refers
to
the
communal
violence
between
Hindus
and
Muslims
during
September–October
1969
,
in
Gujarat
,
India
.


The
violence
was
Gujarat
's
first
major
riot
that
involved
massacre
,
arson
and
looting
on
a
large
scale
.


It
was
the
most
deadly
Hindu-Muslim
violence
since
the
1947
partition
of
India
,
and
remained
such
until
the
1989
Bhagalpur
violence
.


According
to
the
official
figures
,
660
people
were
killed
,
1074
people
were
injured
and
over
48,000
lost
their
property
.


Unofficial
reports
claim
as
high
as
2000
deaths
.


The
Muslim
community
suffered
the
majority
of
the
losses
.


Out
of
the
512
deaths
reported
in
the
police
complaints
,
430
were
Muslims
.


Property
worth
42
million
rupees
was
destroyed
during
the
riots
,
with
Muslims
losing
32
million
worth
of
property
.


A
distinctive
feature
of
the
violence
was
the
attack
on
Muslim
chawls
by
their
Dalit
Hindu
neighbours
who
had
maintained
peaceful
relations
with
them
until
this
point
.


The
riots
happened
during
the
chief
ministership
of
the
Indian
National
Congress
leader
Hitendra
Desai
.


the
justice
reddy
commission
set
up
by
his
government
blamed
the
hindu
nationalist
organizations
for
the
violence
.


Various
writers
trace
the
causes
of
the
riots
to
a
mix
of
socioeconomic
and
political
factors
(
see
Background
below
)
.


The
violence
started
on
18
September
1969
after
Muslims
attacked
some
Hindu
sadhus
and
a
temple
,
after
the
cows
herded
by
the
sadhus
caused
injury
to
them
.


The
Hindus
later
attacked
a
Muslim
dargah
,
and
Muslim
protesters
also
attacked
the
temple
again
,
leading
to
a
mass
breakout
of
violence
.


The
riots
started
in
Ahmedabad
,
and
then
spread
to
other
areas
,
notably
Vadodara
,
Mehsana
,
Nadiad
,
Anand
and
Gondal
.


By
26
September
,
the
violence
had
been
brought
under
control
,
however
some
more
violent
incidents
happened
during
18–28
October
1969
.

celebrations
after
the
match
,

to
pick
up
Morrow
and
parade
him
on
his
shoulders
,
but
Adams
slipped
and
Morrow
awkwardly
hit
the
ground
.


He
broke
his
arm
and
had
to
be
rushed
to
hospital
.


Unable
to
receive
his
winner
's
medal
on
the
day
,
he
was
eventually
presented
with
it
before
the
start
of
the

's
''
Siege
of
Leningrad
.


Planning
for
the
operation
began
shortly
after
the
failure
of
the
Sinyavino
Offensive
.


The
German
defeat
in
the
Battle

conducting
offensive
operations
across
the
entire
German-Soviet
front

especially
in
southern
Russia
;
Iskra
formed
the
northern
part
of
the
wider
Soviet
1942–1943
winter
counter-offensive
.


The
operation
was
conducted
by
the
Red
Army
's
Leningrad
Front
,
Volkhov
Front
,
and
the
Baltic
Fleet
from
12
to
30
January
1943
with
the
aim
of
creating
a
land
connection
to
Leningrad
.

the
front
line
had
stabilised
.


The
operation
successfully
opened
a
land
corridor
wide
to
the
city
.


A
railroad
was
swiftly
built
through
the
corridor
which
allowed
more
supplies
to
reach
the
city
than
the
Road
of
Life
across
the
frozen
surface
of
Lake
Ladoga
,
significantly
reducing
the
possibility
of
the
capture
of
the
city
and
any
German–Finnish
linkup
.


The
success
led
to
Operation
Polyarnaya
Zvezda
less
than
two
weeks
later
,
which
aimed
to
decisively
defeat
Army
Group
North
,
lifting
the
siege
altogether
.


Polyarnaya
Zvezda
failed
,
achieving
only
minimal
progress
.


Soviet
forces
made
several
other
attempts
in
1943
to
renew
their
offensive
and
to
lift
the
siege
completely
,
but
made
only
modest
gains
in
each
one
.


The
corridor
remained
within
range
of
German
artillery
,
and
the
Red
Army
did
not
finally
lift
the
siege
until
a
year
later

on
27

,
it
voted
to
declare
nepal

Koirala
said
that

that
``
the

earlier
on

may
,
the
major
parties
agreed
on
the
creation
of
the
position
of
president
,
while
the
prime
minister
was
to
hold
executive
powers
;
however
,
they
reached
no
agreement
on
exactly
what
powers
the
president
should
have
or
who
should
become
president
,
and
these
deliberations
led
to
a
delay
in
the
opening
of
the
constituent
assembly
.


On
29
May
,
the
royal
standard
was
removed
from

The
2015
UEFA
Europa
League
Final
was
the
final
match
of
the
2014–15
UEFA
Europa
League
,
the
44th
season
of
Europe
's
secondary
club
football
tournament
organised
by
UEFA
,
and
the
sixth
season
since
it
was
renamed
from
the
UEFA
Cup
to
the
UEFA
Europa
League
.


It
was
played
at
the
National
Stadium
in
Warsaw
,
Poland
,
on
27
May
2015
,
between
Ukrainian
side
Dnipro
Dnipropetrovsk
and
the
title
holders
,
Spanish
side
Sevilla
.


Sevilla
won
the
match
3–2
for
a
record
fourth
title
.


As
winners
,
Sevilla
earned
the
right
to
play
against
the
winners
of
the
2014–15
UEFA
Champions
League
,
Barcelona
,
in
the
2015
UEFA
Super
Cup
.


Moreover
,
for
the
first
time
,
a
place
in
the
UEFA
Champions
League
was
reserved
for
the
UEFA
Europa
League
winners
,
meaning
that
Sevilla
automatically
qualified
for
the
2015–16
UEFA
Champions
League
despite
not
qualifying
through
their
domestic
league
position
.


They
were
guaranteed
to
enter
at
the
group
stage
,
since
the
2015
Champions
League
finalists
(
Juventus
and
Barcelona
)
have
already
qualified
for
the
group
stage
via
their
domestic
leagues
and
therefore
the
berth
in
the
group
stage
reserved
for
the
Champions
League
title
holders
are
not
used
.


The
Hudson
Bay
expedition
of
Jean-François
de
Galaup
,
comte
de
La
Pérouse
was
a
series
of
military
raids
on
the
lucrative
fur
trading
posts
and
fortifications
of
the
Hudson
's
Bay
Company
on
the
shores
of
Hudson
Bay
by
a
squadron
of
the
French
Royal
Navy
.


Setting
sail
from
Cap-Français
in
1782
,
the
expedition
was
part
of
a
global
naval
war
between
France
and
Great
Britain
during
the
American
Revolutionary
War
.


Operating
under
secret
orders
from
the
Marquis
de
Castries
,
France
's
marine
minister
,
La
Pérouse
sailed
from
Cap-Français
in
May
1782
,
and
arrived
at
the
Prince
of
Wales
Fort
in
early
August
.


That
fort
and
York
Factory
trading
post
both
surrendered
without
a
fight
,
although
some
of
the
furs
stored
at
York
were
spirited
away
by
a
company
ship
that
evaded
the
French
fleet
.


Many
of
the
British
prisoners
were
put
on
a
sloop
and
allowed
to
sail
back
to
England
.


Men
on
La
Pérouse
's
fleet
,
which
had
sailed
with
minimal
winter
provisioning
to
maintain
secrecy
,
suffered
hardships
including
scurvy
and
other
diseases
.


Hudson
's
Bay
Company
finances
suffered
because
of
the
raid
,
which
also
contributed
to
reductions
in
the
native
population
that
did
business
with
the
company

operation
unk
(
)
was
a
military
offensive
undertaken
by
the
croatian
army
(
``
hrvatska
vojska
''
UNK
hv
)
against
the
yugoslav
people
's
army
(
``

UNK

)
and
sao
western

territorial
defense
forces
in
the
sava
river
valley
,
in
the
region
of
western
slavonia
during
the
croatian
war
of
independence
.


The
operation
began
on
29
October
1991
and
ended
on
3
January
1992
when
a
nationwide
ceasefire
was
signed
to
implement
the
Vance
plan
.


The
offensive
was
aimed
at
recapturing
the
region
,
in
conjunction
with
two
other
HV
offensives
launched
against
SAO
Western
Slavonia
in
the
north
of
the
region
within
days
.


Even
though
the
offensive
captured
a
portion
of
the
targeted
area
,
including
the
town
of
Lipik
as
the
first
of
the
larger
settlements
captured
by
the
HV
during
the
war
,
the
mission
objectives
were
not
met
before
the
ceasefire
took
effect
.


SAO
Western
Slavonia
retained
control
of
the
town
of
Okučani
and
its
surroundings
,
including
a
short
section
of
the
Zagreb–Slavonski
Brod
motorway
.


The
halting
of
Operation
Hurricane-91
due
to
the
ceasefire
of
3
January
1992
led
to
opposing
assessments
on
the
possible
outcomes
of
the
offensive
had
there
been
no
ceasefire
.


Assessments
range
from
claims
that
the
JNA
was
on
the
brink
of
defeat
in
the
area
,
to
estimates
that
the
HV
was
too
exhausted
and
its
ammunition
stocks
too
low
to
permit
a
successful
conclusion
of
the
offensive
.


The
three
HV
offensives
launched
in
Western
Slavonia
in
late-1991
led
to
the
displacement
of
approximately
20,000
Croatian
Serb
refugees
who
were
later
settled
in
the
JNA-held
Baranja
region
in
eastern
Croatia
.


The
Antinomian
Controversy
,
also
known
as
the
Free
Grace
Controversy
,
was
a
religious
and
political
conflict
in
the
Massachusetts
Bay
Colony
from
1636
to
1638
.


It
pitted
most
of
the
colony
's
ministers
and
magistrates
against
some
adherents
of
the
Free
Grace
theology
of
Puritan
minister
John
Cotton
.


The
most
notable
Free
Grace
advocates
,
often
called
``
Antinomians
''
,
were
charismatic
Anne
Hutchinson
,
her
brother-in-law
Reverend
John
Wheelwright
,
and
Massachusetts
Bay
Governor
Henry
Vane
.


The
controversy
was
a
theological
debate
concerning
the
``
covenant
of
grace
''
and
``
covenant
of
works
''
.


Anne
Hutchinson
has
historically
been
placed
at
the
center
of
the
controversy
,
a
strong-minded
woman
who
had
grown
up
under
the
religious
guidance
of
her
father
Francis
Marbury
,
an
Anglican
clergyman
and
school
teacher
.


In
England
,
she
embraced
the
religious
views
of
dynamic
Puritan
minister
John
Cotton
,
who
became
her
mentor
;
Cotton
was
forced
to
leave
England
and
Hutchinson
followed
him
to
New
England
.


In
Boston
,
Hutchinson
was
influential
among
the
settlement
's
women
and
hosted
them
at
her
house
for
discussions
on
the
weekly
sermons
.


Eventually
,
men
were
included
in
these
gatherings
,
such
as
Governor
Vane
.


During
the
meetings
,
Hutchinson
criticized
the
colony
's
ministers
,
accusing
them
of
preaching
a
covenant
of
works
as
opposed
to
the
covenant
of
grace
espoused
by
Reverend
Cotton
.


The
Colony
's
orthodox
ministers
held
meetings
with
Cotton
,
Wheelwright
,
and
Hutchinson
in
the
fall
of
1636
.


A
consensus
was
not
reached
,
and
religious
tensions
mounted
.


To
ease
the
situation
,
the
leaders
called
for
a
day
of
fasting
and
repentance
on
January
19
,
1637
.


However
,
Cotton
invited
Wheelwright
to
speak
at
the
Boston
church
during
services
that
day
,
and
his
sermon
created
a
furor
which
deepened
the
growing
division
.


In
March
1637
,
the
court
accused
Wheelwright
of
contempt
and
sedition
,
but
he
was
not
sentenced
.


His
supporters
circulated
a
petition
on
his
behalf
,
mostly
people
from
the
Boston
church
.


The
religious
controversy
had
immediate
political
ramifications
.


During
the
election
of
May
1637
,
the
free
grace
advocates
suffered
two
major
setbacks
when
John
Winthrop
defeated
Vane
in
the
gubernatorial
race
,
and
the
Boston
magistrates
were
voted
out
of
office
who
had
supported
Hutchinson
and
Wheelwright
.


Vane
returned
to
England
in
August
1637
.


at
the
november
1637
court
,
wheelwright
was
sentenced
to
banishment
,
and
anne
hutchinson
was
brought
to
trial
.


She
defended
herself
well
against
the
prosecution
,
but
she
claimed
on
the
second
day
of
her
hearing
that
she
possessed
direct
personal
revelation
from
God
,
and
she
prophesied
ruin
upon
the
colony
.


She
was
charged
with
contempt
and
sedition
and
banished
from
the
colony
,
and
her
departure
brought
the
controversy
to
a
close
.


The
events
of
1636
to
1638
are
regarded
as
crucial
to
an
understanding
of
religion
and
society
in
the
early
colonial
history
of
New
England
.


The
idea
that
Hutchinson
played
a
central
and
singular
role
in
the
controversy
went
largely
unchallenged
until
2002
,
when
Michael
Winship
's
account
of
the
controversy
portrayed
Cotton
,
Wheelwright
,
and
Vane
as
equally
complicit
with
her
.


The
Irish
War
of
Independence
(
)
or
Anglo-Irish
War
was
a
guerrilla
war
fought
in
Ireland
from
1919
to
1921
between
the
Irish
Republican
Army
(
IRA
,
the
army
of
the
Irish
Republic
)
and
British
forces
:
the
British

along
with
the
quasi-military
Royal
Irish
Constabulary
(
RIC
)
and
its
paramilitary
forces
the
Auxiliaries
and
Ulster
Special
Constabulary
(
USC
)
.


It
was
an
escalation
of
the
Irish
revolutionary
period
into
warfare
.


in
april
1916
,
irish
republicans
launched
the
easter
rising
against
british
rule
and
proclaimed
an
irish
republic
.


although
it
was
crushed
after
a
week
of
fighting
,
the
easter
rising
and
the
british
response
led
to
greater
popular
support
for
irish
independence
.


In
the
December
1918
election
,
the
republican
party
Sinn
Féin
won
a
landslide
victory
in
Ireland
.


On
21

1919

formed

Éireann
)
and
declared
Irish
independence
.


That
day
,
two
RIC
officers
were
shot
dead
in
the
Soloheadbeg
ambush
by
IRA
volunteers
acting
on
their
own
initiative
.


The
conflict
developed
gradually
.


For
much
of
1919
,
IRA
activity
involved
capturing
weaponry
and
freeing
republican
prisoners
,
while
the
Dáil
set
about
building
a
state
.


In
September
,
the
British
government
outlawed
the
Dáil
and
Sinn
Féin
and
the
conflict
intensified
.


The
IRA
began
ambushing
RIC
and
British
Army
patrols
,
attacking
their
barracks
and
forcing
isolated
barracks
to
be
abandoned
.


The
British
government
bolstered
the
RIC
with
recruits
from
Britain—the
Black
and
Tans
and
Auxiliaries—who
became
notorious
for
ill-discipline
and
reprisal
attacks
on
civilians
,
some
of
which
were
authorised
by
the
British
government
.


Thus
the
conflict
is
sometimes
called
the
Black
and
Tan
War
.


The
conflict
also
involved
civil
disobedience
,
notably
the
refusal
of
Irish
railwaymen
to
transport
British
forces
or
military
supplies
.


In
mid-1920
,
republicans
won
control
of
most
county
councils
,
and
British
authority
collapsed
in
most
of
the
south
and
west
,
forcing
the
British
government
to
introduce
emergency
powers
.


About
300
people
had
been
killed
by
late
1920
,
but
the
conflict
escalated
in
November
.


On
Bloody
Sunday
in
Dublin
,
21
November
1920
,
fourteen
British
intelligence
operatives
were
assassinated
in
the
morning
;
then
in
the
afternoon
the
RIC
opened
fire
on
a
crowd
at
a
Gaelic
football
match
,
killing
fourteen
civilians
and
wounding
65
.


A
week
later
,
seventeen
Auxiliaries
were
killed
by
the
IRA
in
the
Kilmichael
Ambush
in
County
Cork
.


The
British
government
declared
martial
law
in
much
of
southern
Ireland
.


The
centre
of
Cork
city
was
burnt
out
by
British
forces
in
December
1920
.


Violence
continued
to
escalate
over
the
next
seven
months
,
when
1,000
people
were
killed
and
4,500
republicans
were
interned
.


Much
of
the
fighting
took
place
in
Munster
(
particularly
County
Cork
)
,
Dublin
and
Belfast
,
which
together
saw
over
75
percent
of
the
conflict
deaths
.


The
conflict
in
north-east
Ulster
had
a
sectarian
aspect
.


While
the
Catholic
minority
there
mostly
backed
Irish
independence
,
the
Protestant
majority
were
mostly
unionist/loyalist
.


A
Special
Constabulary
was
formed
,
made
up
mostly
of
Protestants
,
and
loyalist
paramilitaries
were
active
.


They
attacked
Catholics
in
reprisal
for
IRA
actions
,
and
in
Belfast
a
sectarian
conflict
raged
in
which
almost
500
were
killed
,
most
of
them
Catholics
.


In
May
1921
,
Ireland
was
partitioned
under
British
law
by
the
Government
of
Ireland
Act
,
which
created
Northern
Ireland
.


Both
sides
agreed
to
a
ceasefire
(
or
'truce
'
)
on
11
July
1921
.


the
unk
talks
led
to
the
signing
of
the
anglo-irish
treaty
on
6
december
1921
.


This
ended
British
rule
in
most
of
Ireland
and
,
after
a
ten-month
transitional
period
overseen
by
a
provisional
government
,
the
Irish
Free
State
was
created
as
a
self-governing
Dominion
on
6
December
1922
.


Northern
Ireland
remained
within
the
United
Kingdom
.


After
the
ceasefire
,
violence
in
Belfast
and
fighting
in
border
areas
of
Northern
Ireland
continued
,
and
the
IRA
launched
a
failed
Northern
offensive
in
May
1922
.


in
june
1922
,
disagreement
among
republicans
over
the
anglo-irish
treaty
led
to
the
ten-month
irish
civil
war
.


The
Irish
Free
State
awarded
62,868
medals
for
service
during
the
War
of
Independence
,
of
which
15,224
were
issued
to
IRA
fighters
of
the
flying
columns
.


The
Second
Anglo-Sikh
War
was
a
military
conflict
between
the
Sikh
Empire
and
the
British
East
India
Company
that
took
place
in
1848
and
1849
.


It
resulted
in
the
fall
of
the
Sikh
Empire
,
and
the
annexation
of
the
Punjab
and
what
subsequently
became
the
North-West
Frontier
Province
,
by
the
East
India
Company
.


On
19
April
1848
Patrick
Vans
Agnew
of
the
civil
service
and
Lieutenant
William
Anderson
of
the
Bombay
European
regiment
,
having
been
sent
to
take
charge
of
Multan
from
Diwan
Mulraj
,
were
murdered
there
,
and
within
a
short
time
the
Sikh
troops
joined
in
open
rebellion
.


Governor-General
of
India
Lord
Dalhousie
agreed
with
Sir
Hugh
Gough
,
the
commander-in-chief
,
that
the
British
East
India
Company
's
military
forces
were
neither
adequately
equipped
with
transport
and
supplies
,
nor
otherwise
prepared
to
take
the
field
immediately
.


He
also
foresaw
the
spread
of
the
rebellion
,
and
the
necessity
that
must
arise
,
not
merely
for
the
capture
of
Multan
,
but
also
for
the
entire
subjugation
of
the
Punjab
.


He
therefore
resolutely
delayed
to
strike
,
organized
a
strong
army
for
operations
in
November
,
and
himself
proceeded
to
the
Punjab
.


Despite
the
brilliant
successes
gained
by
Herbert
Edwardes
in
the
Second
Anglo-Sikh
War
with
Mulraj
,
and
Gough
's
indecisive
victories
at
Ramnagar
in
November
,
at
Sadulapur
in
December
,
and
at
the
Battle
of
Chillianwala
on
13
January
1849
,
the
stubborn
resistance
at
Multan
showed
that
the
task
required
the
utmost
resources
of
the
government
.


at
length
,
on
22
january
,
the
multan
fortress
was
taken
by
general
whish
,
who
was
thus
set
at
liberty
to
join
gough
at
gujarat
.


Here
a
complete
victory
was
won
on
21
February
at
the
Battle
of
Gujrat
,
the
Sikh
army
reveller
stop
fighting
at
Rawalpindi
,
and
their
Afghan
allies
were
chased
out
of
India
.


After
the
victory
at
Gujarat
,
Lord
Dalhousie
annexed
the
Punjab
for
the
East
India
Company
in
1849
.


For
his
services
the
Earl
of
Dalhousie
received
the
thanks
of
the
British
parliament
and
a
step
in
the
peerage
,
as
marquess
.


The
Battle
of
Marton
or
Meretum
took
place
on
approximately
22
March
871
at
a
place
recorded
as
Marton
,
perhaps
in
Wiltshire
or
Dorset
.


according
to
the
anglo-saxon
chronicle
,
the
battle
took
place
``
about
two
months
''
after
a
prior
loss
to
the
danes
at
the
battle
of
basing
,
in
which
both
sides
suffered
heavy
losses
.


King
Æthelred
of
Wessex
and
Prince
Alfred
fought
against
the
Danes
,
who
were
possibly
under
the
leadership
of
King
Halfdan
Ragnarsson
,
who
had
commanded
many
of
the
earlier
battles
that
year
.


the
chronicle
tells
us
that
the
forces
were
split
in
two
and
that
the
danes
were
initially
put
to
flight
,
but
at
the
end
of
the
day
and
after
``
much
slaughter
''
the
danes
remained
masters
of
the
field
.


Among
the
fallen
was
Bishop
Heahmund
.


It
was
the
last
of
the
battles
known
to
be
fought
by
Æthelred
against
the
Danes
that
year
,
and
the
defeated
King
is
reported
to
have
died
on
15
April
871
.


Whether
he
died
in
battle
,
or
as
a
result
of
wounds
suffered
in
battle
is
unclear
.


The
site
of
the
battle
is
unknown
.


Suggestions
include
the
borders
of
the
London
Borough
of
Merton
,
Merton
in
Oxfordshire
,
Merdon
Castle
(
Hursley
parish
near
Winchester
)
in
Hampshire
,
Marden
in
Wiltshire
,
Marten
in
Wiltshire
or
Martin
in
Dorset
.


The
more
westerly
locations
tend
to
be
favoured
because
King
Æthelred
was
buried
in
Wimborne
Minster
,
Dorset
,
shortly
afterwards
.


Another
possible
location
for
the
battle
is
at
Merritown
,
on
the
River
Stour
,
a
few
miles
downstream
of
Wimborne
,
thus
providing
a
short
journey
with
the
body
of
King
Æthelred
.


The
medieval
manor
of
Merritown
was
situated
on
what
is
now
the
southern
perimeter
of
Bournemouth
(
Hurn
)
Airport
.


Big
Spring
Jam
was
an
annual
music
festival
taking
place
in
Huntsville
,
Alabama
.


The
Jam
,
which
began
in
1993
,
typically
took
place
the
fourth
weekend
in
September
.


From
1993
to
2009
,
this
was
a
three-day
beginning
Friday
and
ending
Sunday
.


The
2011
revival
was
a
two-day
event
on
Friday
and
Saturday
only
.


It
featured
acts
from
all
genres
of
music
including
local
bands
,
emerging
talent
,
old
favorites
,
and
the
top
artists
of
the
day
.


Along
with
the
music
,
the
Big
Spring
Jam
also
held
an
annual
5k
race
.


The
title
of
the
festival
is
a
matter
of
confusion
for
many
,
especially
those
outside
Huntsville
,
as
the
Big
``
Spring
''
Jam
was
held
early
each
autumn
.


The
title
,
however
,
came
from
the
location
,
Big
Spring
International
Park
in
downtown
Huntsville
.


Big
Spring
Jam
usually
featured
four
or
more
temporary
stages
set
up
throughout
the
park
.


Each
stage
typically
featured
the
same
genres
of
music
throughout
the
weekend
.


One
stage
featured
country
music
exclusively
,
another
featured
Christian
contemporary
,
and
the
remainder
of
the
stages
were
rock-based
.


To
alleviate
the
impact
of
inclement
weather
,
in
2011
the
country
music
stage
was
moved
indoors
to
the
Propst
Arena
in
the
Von
Braun
Center
.


Unlike
most
other
large-scale
music
festivals
,
Big
Spring
Jam
was
a
not-for-profit
event
,
organized
each
year
by
the
Huntsville
Heritage
Foundation
in
conjunction
with
the
Von
Braun
Center
.


Proceeds
from
the
event
benefited
local
charities
,
health
and
human
services
agencies
,
and
arts
and
entertainment
organizations
throughout
North
Alabama
.


In
recent
years
,
the
Big
Spring
Jam
suffered
a
tarnished
reputation
due
to
weather
events
.


In
both
2005
,
and
2006
,
some
of
the
main
acts
were
canceled
due
to
inclement
weather
.


Despite
existing
as
a
non-profit
event
,
Big
Spring
Jam
officials
refused
to
refund
ticket
prices
after
canceling
events
.


For
example
,
tickets
were
sold
after
the
event
was
rained
out
in
2006
-
and
officials
refused
to
refund
the
ticket
prices
.


Tickets
were
sold
up
until
the
point
the
event
was
canceled
.


However
,
the
2007
and
2008
events
,
where
the
weather
was
favorable
,
were
deemed
highly
successful
.


The
2010
event
was
cancelled
due
to
financial
and
logistical
issues
but
the
event
returned
,
as
promised
,
in
2011
.


The
2011
Big
Spring
Jam
was
a
smaller
,
two-day
event
with
some
acts
moved
into
the
Propst
Arena
at
the
Von
Braun
Center
.


The
2011
event
drew
only
30,000
attendees
,
down
sharply
from
the
240,000
who
attended
in
2003
,
with
blame
placed
on
the
smaller
scope
of
the
event
,
competition
from
high
school
and
college
football
,
the
economic
downturn
,
and
weather
on
the
Jam
's
first
day
.


Organizers
announced
in
November
2011
that
they
would
``
shelve
''
the
event
for
the
immediate
future
with
plans
to
``
retool
''
or
``
recreate
''
it
at
some
point
when
the
economy
improves
and
local
interest
increases
.


The
1898
VFL
Grand
Final
was
an
Australian
rules
football
game
contested
between
the
Essendon
Football
Club
and
Fitzroy
Football
Club
,
held
in
Melbourne
on
24
September
1898
.


The
match
was
played
to
determine
the
premiers
for
the
1898
VFL
season
.


Fitzroy
won
the
match
by
15
points
.


The
game
was
played
under
atrocious
ground
conditions
,
in
front
of
16,538
people
,
at
the
St
Kilda
Cricket
Ground
.


The
match
is
recognised
as
the
first
VFL
Grand
Final
,
although
the
term
``
Grand
Final
''
was
not
in
wide
use
until
1931
.


It
was
the
first
time
that
Victorian
Football
League
premiership
was
decided
in
a
final
match
,
after
the
1897
premiership
was
won
under
a
different
finals
system
by
Essendon
,
when
they
finished
above
three
other
clubs
in
the
finals
series
ladder
.


Both
the
Fitzroy
back-pocket
Stan
Reid
and
the
Essendon
full-forward
Charlie
Moore
would
later
die
in
South
Africa
in
active
service
during
the
Anglo-Boer
War
;
Moore
on
5
May
1901
,
and
Reid
on
23
June
1901
.


The
attacks
at
Fort
Blue
Mounds
were
two
separate
incidents
which
occurred
on
June
6
and
20
,
1832
,
as
part
of
the
Black
Hawk
War
.


In
the
first
incident
,
area
residents
attributed
the
killing
of
a
miner
to
a
band
of
Ho-Chunk
warriors
,
and
concluded
that
more
Ho-Chunk
planned
to
join
Black
Hawk
in
his
war
against
white
settlers
.


The
second
incident
occurred
east
of
the
fort
as
a
Sauk
raiding
party
,
estimated
by
eyewitnesses
to
be
as
large
as
100
warriors
,
attacked
two
militiamen
who
were
investigating
noises
heard
the
night
before
.


Two
members
of
the
militia
stationed
at
Blue
Mounds
were
killed
in
the
attack
,
and
both
their
bodies
were
badly
mutilated
.


The
attacks
followed
an
increase
in
tension
after
the
Hall
sisters
were
released
at
Fort
Blue
Mounds
on
June
1
.


The
sisters
had
been
kidnapped
during
the
Indian
Creek
massacre
in
May
and
were
brought
to
Blue
Mounds
by
a
party
of
Ho-Chunk
.


Militia
leader
Henry
Dodge
became
suspicious
of
the
Ho-Chunk
and
took
them
prisoner
,
though
they
were
later
released
as
tension
between
the
Ho-Chunk
and
white
settlers
increased
.


The
attacks
also
lent
credence
to
the
belief
that
more
Ho-Chunk
were
set
to
join
Black
Hawk
's
war
against
white
settlers
in
Illinois
and
Michigan
Territory
.


though
other
attacks
on
the
fort
were
expected
,
they
never
happened
and
fort
blue
mounds
served
as
a
supply
center
for
the
remaining
days
of
the
war
.


The
Solidarity
Day
marches
were
a
pair
of
large
political
rallies
in
support
of
organized
labor
that
took
place
in
Washington
,
D.C.
on
September
19
,
1981
and
August
31
,
1991
.


Approximately
250,000-500,000
people
took
part
in
each
march
.


Events
leading
up
to
the
first
march
.


on
3
august
1981
,
12,500
air
traffic
controllers
,
members
of
the
professional
air
traffic
controllers
organization
(
patco
)
,
walked
off
their
jobs
with
the
federal
aviation
administration
.


President
Ronald
Reagan
vowed
to
fire
the
controllers
if
they
did
not
return
to
work
within
48
hours
.


On
the
first
day
of
the
strike
85
percent
of
union
controllers
were
out
.


Two
days
later
,
Reagan
fired
the
striking
controllers
--
12,000
air
traffic
controllers
were
fired
on
August
5
.


PATCO
was
demanding
wage
increases
,
safer
working
conditions
,
a
32-hour
week
,
and
an
end
to
long
shift
patterns
.


As
federal
employees
they
were
,
however
,
barred
from
striking
.


The
FAA
replaced
the
strikers
with
non-union
workers
.


According
to
the
union
,
481
near
misses
among
airplanes
in
US
airspace
were
reported
in
the
first
year
of
the
strike
,
compared
to
10
reported
in
the
10
years
before
the
walkout
.


Militants
were
arrested
,
jailed
and
fined
.


Some
PATCO
members
with
federal
mortgages
lost
their
homes
.


The
union
was
fined
millions
of
dollars
,
and
its
$
3.5
million
strike
fund
was
frozen
.


Eventually
,
the
government
succeeded
in
decertifying
PATCO
.


The
president
of
the
US
union
federation
,
the
AFL-CIO
,
denounced
Reagan
's
attack
on
PATCO
.


A
letter
was
also
sent
to
AFL-CIO
affiliates
,
discouraging
them
from
taking
any
type
of
strike
action
in
solidarity
.


Following
the
firing
of
the
PATCO
workers
,
officials
from
that
union
visited
various
other
unions
in
an
attempt
to
garner
support
for
the
strike
.


these
efforts
were
not
particularly
well
received
because
in
the
1980
presidential
election
,
patco
refused
to
back
president
jimmy
carter
,
instead
endorsing
republican
party
candidate
ronald
reagan
.


PATCO
's
refusal
to
endorse
the
Democratic
candidate
stemmed
in
large
part
from
poor
labor
relations
with
the
FAA
(
the
employer
of
PATCO
members
)
under
the
Carter
administration
and
Ronald
Reagan
's
endorsement
of
the
union
and
its
struggle
for
better
conditions
during
the
1980
election
campaign
.


Mark
Duggan
,
a
29-year-old
British
man
,
was
shot
and
killed
by
police
in
Tottenham
,
North
London
on
4
August
2011
.


The
Metropolitan
Police
stated
that
officers
were
attempting
to
arrest
Duggan
on
suspicion
of
planning
an
attack
,
and
that
he
was
in
possession
of
a
handgun
.


Duggan
died
from
a
gunshot
wound
to
the
chest
.


The
circumstances
of
Duggan
's
death
resulted
in
public
protests
in
Tottenham
,
which
led
to
conflict
with
police
and
escalated
into
riots
across
London
and
other
English
cities
.


Duggan
was
under
investigation
by
Operation
Trident
,
a
subdivision
of
the
Metropolitan
Police
.


He
was
known
to
be
in
possession
of
a
BBM
Bruni
Model
92
handgun
(
a
blank-firing
replica
of
a
Beretta
92
converted
to
fire
live
rounds
)
,
given
to
him
by
Kevin
Hutchinson-Foster
,
15
minutes
before
he
was
shot
.


At
a
trial
of
Hutchinson-Foster
in
September–October
2012
the
jury
failed
to
reach
a
verdict
.


at
his
re-trial
,
on
31
january
2013
,
unk
was
convicted
of
supplying
duggan
with
the
gun
and
jailed
.


the
independent
police
complaints
commission
(
ipcc
)
has
been
investigating
the
case
but
has
delayed
release
of
its
report
for
more
than
a
year
.


A
public
inquest
on
the
Duggan
death
began
on
16
September
2013
,
and
ended
on
8
January
2014
with
an
8–2
majority
concluding
that
Duggan
's
death
was
a
lawful
killing
.


The
official
account
of
Duggan
's
death
has
undergone
numerous
changes
,
attracting
criticism
and
suspicion
from
interested
parties
and
other
supporters
.


These
critics
accuse
police
of
misconduct
and
of
failing
to
cooperate
with
those
investigating
Duggan
's
death
.

.


These
individuals
have
been
characterized
as
having

they
were
accused
of

The
Laotian
Civil
War
(
1959–75
)
was
a
civil
war
in
Laos
fought
between
the
Communist
Pathet
Lao
(
including
many
North
Vietnamese
of
Lao
ancestry
)
and
the
Royal
Lao
Government
from
23
May
1959
to
2
December
1975
.


It
is
associated
with
the
Cambodian
Civil
War
and
the
Vietnam
War
,
with
both
sides
receiving
heavy
external
support
in
a
proxy
war
between
the
global
Cold
War
superpowers
.


It
is
called
the
Secret
War
among
the
CIA
Special
Activities
Division
and
Hmong
veterans
of
the
conflict
.


The
Kingdom
of
Laos
was
a
covert
theater
for
other
belligerents
during
the
Vietnam
War
.


the
unk
treaty
of
amity
and
association
(
signed
22
october
1953
)
transferred
remaining
french
powers
to
the
royal
lao
government
(
except
control
of
military
affairs
)
,
establishing
laos
as
an
independent
member
of
the
french
union
.


However
,
this
government
did
not
include
representatives
from
the
Lao
Issara
anti-colonial
armed
nationalist
movement
.


The
following
years
were
marked
by
a
rivalry
between
the
neutralists
under
Prince
Souvanna
Phouma
,
the
right
wing
under
Prince
Boun
Oum
of
Champassak
,
and
the
left-wing
Lao
Patriotic
Front
under
Prince
Souphanouvong
and
half-Vietnamese
future
Prime
Minister
Kaysone
Phomvihane
.


Several
attempts
were
made
to
establish
coalition
governments
,
and
a
``
tri-coalition
''
government
was
finally
seated
in
Vientiane
.


The
actual
fighting
in
Laos
involved
the
North
Vietnamese
Army
,
U.S.
troops
and
Thai
forces
and
South
Vietnamese
army
forces
directly
and
through
irregular
proxies
in
a
struggle
for
control
over
the
Laotian
Panhandle
.


The
North
Vietnamese
Army
occupied
the
area
to
use
for
its
Ho
Chi
Minh
Trail
supply
corridor
and
as
staging
area
for
offensives
into
South
Vietnam
.


There
was
a
second
major
theater
of
action
on
and
near
the
northern
Plain
of
Jars
.


The
North
Vietnamese
and
Pathet
Lao
eventually
emerged
victorious
in
1975
,
as
part
of
the
general
communist
victory
in
all
of
former
French
Indochina
that
year
.


A
total
of
up
to
300,000
people
from
Laos
fled
to
neighboring
Thailand
following
the
Pathet
Lao
takeover
.


After
the
communists
took
power
in
Laos
,
Hmong
rebels
fought
the
new
government
.


The
Hmong
were
persecuted
as
traitors
and
``
lackeys
''
of
the
Americans
,
with
the
government
and
its
Vietnamese
allies
carrying
out
human
rights
abuses
against
Hmong
civilians
.


The
incipient
conflict
between
Vietnam
and
China
also
played
a
role
with
Hmong
rebels
being
accused
of
receiving
support
from
China
.


over
40,000
people
died
in
the
conflict
.


The
Lao
royal
family
were
arrested
by
the
Pathet
Lao
after
the
war
and
sent
to
labor
camps
,
where
most
of
them
died
in
the
late
1970s
and
1980s
,
including
King
Savang
Vatthana
,
Queen
Khamphoui
,
and
Crown
Prince
Vong
Savang
.


the
october
revolution
,
officially
known
in
soviet
historiography
as
the
great
october
socialist
revolution
and
commonly
referred
to
as
the
october
uprising
,
the
october
coup
,
the
bolshevik
revolution
,
the
bolshevik
coup
or
the
red
october
,
was
a
revolution
in
russia
led
by
the
bolshevik
party
of
vladimir
lenin
that
was
instrumental
in
the
larger
russian
revolution
of
unk
.


It
took
place
through
an
armed
insurrection
in
Petrograd
on
7
November
(
25
October
,
O.S
.
)


1917
.


it
followed
and
capitalized
on
the
february
revolution
of
the
same
year
,
which
overthrew
the
tsarist
autocracy
and
resulted
in
a
provisional
government
after
a
transfer
of
power
proclaimed
by
grand
duke
michael
,
the
younger
brother
of
tsar
nicholas
ii
,
who
declined
to
take
power
after
the
tsar
stepped
down
.


During
this
time
,
urban
workers
began
to
organize
into
councils
(
soviets
)
wherein
revolutionaries
criticized
the
provisional
government
and
its
actions
.


After
the
Congress
of
Soviets
,
the
newly
governing
body
,
had
its
second
session
it
elected
members
of
the
Bolsheviks
and
other
left-wing
groups
such
as
the
Left
Socialist
Revolutionaries
to
important
positions
within
the
new
state
of
affairs
.


This
immediately
initiated
the
establishment
of
the
Russian
Soviet
Republic
.


on
17
july
1918
,
the
tsar
and
his
family
were
executed
.


The
revolution
was
led
by
the
Bolsheviks
,
who
used
their
influence
in
the
Petrograd
Soviet
to
organize
the
armed
forces
.


Bolshevik
Red
Guards
forces
under
the
Military
Revolutionary
Committee
began
the
occupation
of
government
buildings
on
7
November
1917
(
New
Style
)
.


The
following
day
,
the
Winter
Palace
(
the
seat
of
the
Provisional
government
located
in
Petrograd
,
then
capital
of
Russia
)
was
captured
.


The
slogan
of
the
October
revolution
was
All
Power
to
the
Soviets
,
meaning
all
power
to
grassroots
democratically
elected
councils
.


For
a
time
,
this
was
observed
,
with
the
interim
Bolshevik-only
Sovnarkom
or
Soviet
government
replaced
by
a
Bolshevik-Left
SR
coalition
government
with
an
All-Russian
Central
Executive
Committee
of
Soviets
composed
of
all
representatives
of
all
factions
who
supported
Soviet
power
and
legally
entrenching
the
peasant
land
seizures
.


throughout
1918
,
from
the
treaty
of
brest-litovsk
which
resulted
in
a
left
sr
walkout
,
and
other
policies
disputed
by
both
the
other
pro-soviet
parties
and
minority
factions
of
the
bolsheviks
,
this
progressively
dissipated
until
by
1920
there
were
no
free
elections
but
delegates
appointed
by
a
party
state
.


the
long-awaited
constituent
assembly
elections
were
held
on
12
november
1917
.


in
contrast
to
their
majority
in
the
soviets
,
the
bolsheviks
only
won
175
seats
in
the
unk
legislative
body
,
coming
in
second
behind
the
socialist
revolutionary
party
,
which
won
370
seats
,
although
the
sr
party
no
longer
existed
as
a
whole
party
by
that
time
,
as
the
left
srs
had
gone
into
coalition
with
the
bolsheviks
from
october
1917
to
march
1918
(
a
cause
of
dispute
of
the
legitimacy
of
the
returned
seating
of
the
constituent
assembly
,
as
the
old
lists
were
drawn
up
by
the
old
sr
party
leadership
,
and
thus
represented
mostly
right
srs
,
whereas
the
peasant
soviet
deputies
had
returned
majorities
for
the
unk
left
srs
)
.


the
constituent
assembly
was
to
first
meet
on
28
november
1917
,
but
its
convocation
was
delayed
until
5
january
1918
by
the
bolsheviks
.


on
its
first
and
only
day
in
session
,
the
constituent
assembly
came
into
conflict
with
the
soviets
,
and
it
rejected
soviet
decrees
on
peace
and
land
,
resulting
in
the
constituent
assembly
being
dissolved
the
next
day
by
order
of
the
congress
of
soviets
.


As
the
revolution
was
not
universally
recognized
,
there
followed
the
struggles
of
the
Russian
Civil
War
(
1917–22
)
and
the
creation
of
the
Soviet
Union
in
1922
.


The
1994
Commonwealth
Games
were
held
in
Victoria
,
in
the
province
of
British
Columbia
in
Canada
,
from
18
to
28
August
1994
.


The
XV
Commonwealth
Games
(
French
:
``
XV
Jeux
du
Commonwealth
''
)
marked
South
Africa
's
return
to
the
Commonwealth
Games
following
the
apartheid
era
,
and
over
30
years
since
the
country
last
competed
in
the
Games
in
1958
.


Namibia
participated
in
its
first
Games
after
gaining
independence
from
South
Africa
in
1990
,
and
the
Caribbean
island
of
Montserrat
also
made
their
Games
debut
.


This
was
Hong
Kong
's
last
appearance
at
the
Games
before
the
transfer
of
sovereignty
from
Britain
to
China
.


The
official
mascot
of
the
Games
was
an
anthropomorphic
killer
whale
named
``
Klee
Wyck
''
.


``
Klee
Wyck
''
,
meaning
``
the
laughing
one
''
,
was
a
nickname
given
to
Canadian
painter
and
sculptor
Emily
Carr
by
the
Ucluelet
First
Nation
.


Ten
types
of

The
1932
Cuba
hurricane
,
known
also
as
the
Hurricane
of
Santa
Cruz
del
Sur
or
the
1932
Camagüey
hurricane
,
was
the
deadliest
and
one
of
the
most
intense
tropical
cyclones
in
Cuban
history
.


It
is
the
only
Category
5
Atlantic
hurricane
ever
recorded
in
November
,
as
well
as
the
strongest
November
hurricane
on
record
in
the
Atlantic
Basin
.


The
cyclone
had
a
path
through
the
Caribbean
Sea
atypical
to
most
hurricanes
developing
late
in
the
Atlantic
hurricane
season
.


The
storm
's
strong
winds
,
storm
surge
,
and
rain
devastated
an
extensive
portion
of
central
and
eastern
Cuba
,
where
the
storm
was
considered
the
worst
natural
disaster
of
the
20th
century
.


though
the
effects
from
the
hurricane
were
concentrated
primarily
on
cuba
,
significant
effects
were
also
felt
in
the
cayman
islands
and
the
bahamas
,
with
lesser
effects
felt
elsewhere
.


The
tropical
depression
that
would
later
develop
into
the
destructive
hurricane
was
first
located
east
of
the
Lesser
Antilles
on
October
30
,
and
tracked
westward
into
the
Caribbean
Sea
,
reaching
tropical
storm
strength
the
next
day
.


Moving
southwestward
towards
the
southern
portion
of
the
Caribbean
,
the
storm
reached
hurricane
strength
on
November
2
before
a
period
of
rapid
intensification
ensued
.


On
November
6
,
the
tropical
cyclone
reached
its
peak
intensity
as
a
Category
5
hurricane
with
maximum
sustained
winds
of
175
mph
(
280
km/h
)
.


The
storm
weakened
to
Category
4
intensity
while
recurving
northeast
,
moving
ashore
Cuba
's
Camagüey
Province
on
November
9
with
winds
of
150
mph
(
240
km/h
)
.


After
traversing
the
island
,
the
storm
gradually
weakened
as
it
crossed
the
central
Bahamas
Islands
and
near
Bermuda
.


On
November
13
,
the
system
transitioned
into
an
extratropical
cyclone
and
dissipated
the
next
day
.


As
an
intensifying
hurricane
in
the
southern
Caribbean
Sea
,
the
storm
moved
near
the
Netherlands
Antilles
and
Colombia
,
causing
widespread
effects
.


A
prolonged
passage
of
Curacao
resulted
in
the
damaging
of
the
harbor
fortification
.


The
storm
lashed
the
coast
of
Colombia
with
strong
winds
and
torrential
rainfall
,
severely
hampering
the
banana
crop
in
the
region
and
disrupting
telecommunications
.


Several
towns
,
particularly
those
near
the
coast
,
sustained
significant
infrastructural
damage
.


Marked
,
albeit
localized
,
damage
to
banana
crops
was
also
reported
in
Jamaica
,
where
strong
winds
toppled
numerous
trees
.


In
open
waters
,
the
storm
's
track
brought
it
across
numerous
shipping
lanes
,
largely
disrupting
shipping
primarily
in
the
central
Caribbean
and
damaging
several
ships
.

Operation
Goodwood
was
a
series
of
British
carrier
air
raids
conducted
against
the
German
battleship
``
Tirpitz
''
at
her
anchorage
in
Kaafjord
in
occupied
Norway
during
late
August
1944
.


It
was
the
last
of
several
attacks
made
by
the
Home
Fleet
during
1944
which
sought
to
damage
or
sink
``
Tirpitz
''
and
thereby
eliminate
the
threat
it
posed
to
Allied
shipping
.


previous
raids
on
unk
conducted
by
fleet
air
arm
aircraft
had
involved
only
one
air
attack
;
in
operation
goodwood
several
attacks
were
made
in
a
single
week
.


The
Royal
Navy
hoped
that
these
raids
would
wear
down
the
formidable
German
defences
.


The
British
fleet
departed
its
base
on
18
August
and
launched
the
first
raid
against
Kaafjord
on
the
morning
of
22
August
.


The
attack
failed
,
and
a
small
raid
that
evening
inflicted
little
damage
.


Attacks
were
conducted
on
24
and
29
August
and
were
also
failures
.


``
Tirpitz
''
had
been
hit
by
two
bombs
during
the
raid
on
24
August
,
but
neither
caused
significant
damage
.


British
losses
during
Operation
Goodwood
were
17
aircraft
to
all
causes
,
a
frigate
sunk
by
a
submarine
,
and
an
escort
carrier
badly
damaged
.


German
forces
suffered
the
loss
of
12
aircraft
and
damage
to
7
ships
.


in
late
august
1944
,
responsibility
for
attacking
``
tirpitz
''
was
transferred
to
the
royal
air
force
.


In
three
heavy
bomber
raids
conducted
during
September
and
October
1944
,
the
battleship
was
first
crippled
and
then
sunk
.


historians
regard
operation
goodwood
as
a
significant
failure
for
the
fleet
air
arm
and
attribute
its
results
to
the
shortcomings
of
the
force
's
aircraft
and
their
armament
.


Operation
Mascot
was
an
unsuccessful
British
carrier
air
raid
conducted
against
the
German
battleship
``
Tirpitz
''
at
her
anchorage
in
Kaafjord
,
Norway
,
on
17
July
1944
.


The
attack
was
one
of
a
series
of
strikes
against
the
battleship
launched
from
aircraft
carriers
between
April
and
August
1944
,
and
was
initiated
after
Allied
intelligence
determined
that
the
damage
inflicted
during
the
Operation
Tungsten
raid
on
3
April
had
been
repaired
.


A
force
of
44
British
dive
bombers
and
40
fighters
took
off
from
three
aircraft
carriers
in
the
early
hours
of
17
July
.


German
radar
stations
detected
these
aircraft
while
they
were
en
route
to
Kaafjord
,
and
``
Tirpitz
''
was
protected
by
a
smoke
screen
by
the
time
the
strike
force
arrived
.


Few
of
the
British
airmen
were
able
to
spot
the
battleship
,
and
their
attacks
did
not
inflict
any
significant
damage
.


German
losses
were
limited
to
a
patrol
craft
,
and
three
British
aircraft
were
destroyed
or
damaged
beyond
repair
by
Kaafjord
's
defenders
.


A
group
of
German
submarines
attempted
to
intercept
the
carrier
force
as
it
returned
to
base
,
without
success
.


Two
U-boats
were
sunk
near
the
carriers
by
British
patrol
aircraft
and
several
others
were
damaged
.


in
august
1944
,
the
royal
navy
conducted
operation
goodwood
,
four
more
carrier
raids
against
``
tirpitz
''
which
also
failed
and
the
task
of
sinking
the
battleship
was
transferred
to
the
royal
air
force
.


on
21
january
1968
,
an
aircraft
accident
(
sometimes
known
as
the
thule
affair
or
thule
accident
(
)
;
)
involving
a
united
states
air
force
(
usaf
)
b-52
bomber
occurred
near
thule
air
base
in
the
danish
territory
of
greenland
.


the
aircraft
was
carrying
four
unk
thermonuclear
bombs
on
a
cold
war
``
chrome
dome
''
alert
mission
over
baffin
bay
when
a
cabin
fire
forced
the
crew
to
abandon
the
aircraft
before
they
could
carry
out
an
emergency
landing
at
thule
air
base
.


Six
crew
members
ejected
safely
,
but
one
who
did
not
have
an
ejection
seat
was
killed
while
trying
to
bail
out
.


The
bomber
crashed
onto
sea
ice
in
North
Star
Bay
,
Greenland
,
causing
the
conventional
explosives
aboard
to
detonate
and
the
nuclear
payload
to
rupture
and
disperse
,
which
resulted
in
radioactive
contamination
.


The
United
States
and
Denmark
launched
an
intensive
clean-up
and
recovery
operation
,
but
the
secondary
stage
of
one
of
the
nuclear
weapons
could
not
be
accounted
for
after
the
operation
was
completed
.


usaf
strategic
air
command
``
chrome
dome
''
operations
were
discontinued
immediately
after
the
accident
,
which
highlighted
the
safety
and
political
risks
of
the
missions
.


Safety
procedures
were
reviewed
and
more
stable
explosives
were
developed
for
use
in
nuclear
weapons
.


In
1995
,
a
political
scandal
resulted
in
Denmark
after
a
report
revealed
the
government
had
given
tacit
permission
for
nuclear
weapons
to
be
located
in
Greenland
,
in
contravention
of
Denmark
's
1957
nuclear-free
zone
policy
.


Workers
involved
in
the
clean-up
program
have
been
campaigning
for
compensation
for
radiation-related
illnesses
they
experienced
in
the
years
after
the
accident
.


India

played
consistently
well
throughout

,
most
notably
his
contribution
in

is
well
remembered
.


This

During
World
War

,
Operation
Zipper
was
a
British
plan
to
capture
either
Port
Swettenham
or
Port
Dickson
,
Malaya
as
staging
areas
for
the
recapture
of
Singapore
in
Operation
Mailfist
.


However
,
due
to
the
end
of
the
war
in
the
Pacific
,
it
was
never
fully
executed
.


Some
of
the
proposed
landings
on
Penang
went
ahead
as
planned
to
probe
Japanese
intentions
,
encountering
no
resistance
.


The
planned
deception
for
this
attack
was
called
Operation
Slippery
,
whilst
a
small
Special
Operations
Executive
team
led
by
Tun
Ibrahim
Ismail
which
landed
in
October
1944
managed
to
convince
the
Japanese
that
the
landings
were
to
be
on
the
Isthmus
of
Kra
,
to
the
north
.


Operations
Jurist
and
Tiderace
were
put
into
action
following
the
surrender
of

,
with
the
objectives
of
directly
liberating
Penang

,
followed
by
smaller
amphibious
landings
on

The

of
Penang
was
intended
to
test
Japanese
intentions
as
a
prelude
to
the
eventual
recapture
of
Singapore
and
the

of

.


The
Japanese
garrison
in
Penang
surrendered
on
2
September
and
the
Royal
Marines
recaptured
Penang
Island
the
following
day
.


Meanwhile

Allied
fleet
arrived
off
Singapore
on
4
September
and
accepted
the
surrender
of
the
Japanese
forces
stationed
on

A
formal

Qantas
Flight
32
,
an
Airbus
A380
on
a
scheduled
passenger
service
from
London
to
Sydney
via
Singapore
,
suffered
an
uncontained
failure
in
one
of
its
four
Trent
900
engines
.


The
failure
occurred
over
Batam
Island
,
Indonesia
,
four
minutes
after
takeoff
from
Singapore
Changi
Airport
.


After
holding
for
almost
two
hours
to
assess
the
situation
,
the
aircraft
made
a
successful
emergency
landing
at
Changi
.


There
were
no
injuries
to
the
passengers

people
on
the
ground
,
despite

,
and
a

The
subsequent
investigation
concluded
that
the
failure
had
been
caused
by
the
breaking
of
a
stub

pipe
which
had
been
manufactured

.


The
failure
was
the
first
of
its

At

were
operating
with
five
airlines
:
Qantas

The
accident
led
to
the
temporary
grounding
of
the
rest

It

.


England
were
captained
by
Len
Hutton
,
the
first
professional
cricketer
to
lead
an
MCC
tour
of
Australia
.


the
australian
team
under
ian
johnson
were
confident
of
victory
but
,
despite
losing
the
first
test
by
an
innings
,
england
won
the
series
unk
and
retained
the
ashes
.


England
were
the
first
touring
team
to
win
a
series
in
Australia
since
1932–33
and
the
last
until
1970–71
.


They
were
the
second
of
only
three
touring
teams
to
win
a
series
in
Australia
from
behind
,
the
other
two
being
England
in
1911–12
and
the
West
Indies
in
1992–93
.


The
tour
is
best
remembered
for
the
bowling
of
Frank
Tyson
,
who
was
at
the
time
regarded
as
arguably
the
fastest
and
most
frightening
bowler
ever

The
Unification
of
Hawai
'
i
(
1782–1810
)
was
a
series
of
wars
in
the
Hawai'ian
Islands
fought
over
control
of
the
entire
island
chain
.


At
the
time
of
European
contact
,
the
islands
were
divided
amongst
competing
Ali
'
i
,
or
high
chiefs
.


The
Island
of
Hawai
'
i
was
divided
into
several
districts
,
Moloka
'
i
,
Lana
'
i
,
and
Kaho'olawe
were
united
under
Maui
,
O'ahu
was
independent
,
and
Kauai
ruled
Ni'ihau
.


The
feudal
Ali
'
i
often
fought
wars
to
gain
land
and
mana
;
however
the
introduction
of
European
weapons
gave
some
Ali
'
i
an
advantage
over
others
,
and
they
began
aggressively
taking
over
their
neighbors
.


First
the
big
island
was
consolidated
by
Kamehameha
I
after
overthrowing
his
uncle
for
control
of
the
Kona
Hawaii
.


Meanwhile
,
the
Kingdom
of
Maui
invaded
and
conquered
O'ahu
.


With
Hawai
'
i
united
under
his
rule
,
Kamehameha
eventually
invaded
Maui
and
Oahu
,
culminating
in
the
climatic
battle
that
was
the
Battle
of
Nu'uanu
.


Before
he
could
successfully
invade
the
last
two
remaining
islands
,
the
paramount
Chief
of
Kaua
'
i
,
Kaumuali
'
i
,
negotiated
a
peace
that
submitted
the
islands
to
Hawai'ian
rule
.


The
Gunfight
at
the
O.K
.


Corral
was
a
30-second
shootout
between
lawmen
and
members
of
a
loosely
organized
group
of
outlaws
called
the
Cowboys
that
took
place
at
about
3:00
p.m.
on
Wednesday
,
October
26
,
1881
,
in
Tombstone
,
Arizona
Territory
.


It
is
generally
regarded
as
the
most
famous
shootout
in
the
history
of
the
American
Wild
West
.


The
gunfight
was
the
result
of
a
long-simmering
feud
,
with
Cowboys
Billy
Claiborne
,
Ike
and
Billy
Clanton
,
and
Tom
and
Frank
McLaury
on
one
side
and
town
Marshal
Virgil
Earp
,
Special
Policeman
Morgan
Earp
,
Special
Policeman
Wyatt
Earp
,
and
temporary
policeman
Doc
Holliday
on
the
other
side
.


Billy
Clanton
and
both
McLaury
brothers
were
killed
.


Ike
Clanton
,
Billy
Claiborne
,
and
Wes
Fuller
ran
from
the
fight
.


Virgil
,
Morgan
,
and
Doc
Holliday
were
wounded
,
but
Wyatt
Earp
was
unharmed
.


Wyatt
is
often
erroneously
regarded
as
the
central
figure
in
the
shootout
,
although
his
brother
Virgil
was
Tombstone
city
marshal
and
deputy
U.S.
marshal
that
day
and
had
far
more
experience
as
a
sheriff
,
constable
,
marshal
,
and
soldier
in
combat
.


The
shootout
has
come
to
represent
a
period
of
the
American
Old
West
when
the
frontier
was
virtually
an
open
range
for
outlaws
,
largely
unopposed
by
law
enforcement
officers
who
were
spread
thin
over
vast
territories
.


It
was
not
well
known
to
the
American
public
until
1931
,
when
Stuart
Lake
published
the
initially
well-received
biography
``
''
two
years
after
Earp
's
death
.


The
book
was
the
basis

Ford

and
the
1957
film
``
Gunfight
at
the
O.K
.


Corral
''
,
after
which
the
shootout
became
known
by
that
name
.


since
then
,
the
conflict
has
been
portrayed
with
varying
degrees
of
accuracy
in
numerous
western
films
and
books
,
and
has
become
an
archetype
for
much
of
the
popular
imagery
associated
with
the
old
west
.


Despite
its
name
,
the
gunfight
did
not
take
place
within
or
next
to
the
O.K
.


Corral
,
which
fronted
Allen
Street
and
had
a
rear
entrance
lined
with
horse
stalls
on
Fremont
Street
.


The
shootout
actually
took
place
in
a
narrow
lot
on
the
side
of
C.
S.
Fly
's
Photographic
Studio
on
Fremont
Street
,
six
doors
west
of
the
O.K
.


Corral
's
rear
entrance
.


Some
members
of
the
two
opposing
parties
were
initially
only
about
apart
.


About
30
shots
were
fired
in
30
seconds
.


Ike
Clanton
subsequently
filed
murder
charges
against
the
Earps
and
Doc
Holliday
.


After
a
30-day
preliminary
hearing
and
a
brief
stint
in
jail
,
the
lawmen
were
shown
to
have
acted
within
the
law
.


The
gunfight
was
not
the
end
of
the
conflict
.


On
December
28
,
1881
,
Virgil
Earp
was
ambushed
and
maimed
in
a
murder
attempt
by
the
Cowboys
.


On
March
18
,
1882
,
a
Cowboy
fired
from
a
dark
alley
through
the
glass
door
of
a
Campbell
&
Hatch
's
saloon
and
billiard
parlor
,
killing
Morgan
Earp
.


The
suspects
in
both
incidents
furnished
alibis
supplied
by
other
Cowboys
and
were
not
indicted
.


Wyatt
Earp
,
newly
appointed
as
Deputy
U.S
.


Marshal
in
Cochise
County
,
then
took
matters
into
his
own
hands
in
a
personal
vendetta
.


He
was
pursued
by
county
sheriff
Johnny
Behan
,
who
had
received
a
warrant
from
Tucson
for
Wyatt
's
shooting
of
Frank
Stilwell
.


On
Friday
,
28
February
1986
,
at
23:21
CET
(
22:21
UTC
)
,
Olof
Palme
,
Prime
Minister
of
Sweden
,
was
fatally
wounded
by
a
single
gunshot
while
walking
home
from
a
cinema
with
his
wife
Lisbet
Palme
on
the
central
Stockholm
street
Sveavägen
.


Lisbet
Palme
was
slightly
wounded
by
a
second
shot
.


The
couple
did
not
have
bodyguards
at
the
time
.


Christer
Pettersson
,
who
had
previously
been
convicted
of
manslaughter
,
was
convicted
of
the
murder
in
1988
after
having
been
identified
as
the
killer
by
Palme
's
wife
.


However
,
on
appeal
to
Svea
Court
of
Appeal
,
he
was
acquitted
.


A
petition
for
a
new
trial
,
filed
by
the
prosecutor
,
was
denied
by
the
Supreme
Court
of
Sweden
.


Pettersson
died
in
late
September
2004
,
legally
declared
not
guilty
of
the
Palme
assassination
.


The
case
remains
unsolved
and
has
given
rise
to
conspiracy
theories
.


the
white
house
farm
murders
took
place
near
the
village
of
tolleshunt
d'arcy
,
essex
,
england
,
during
the
night
of
unk
august
1985
.


Nevill
and
June
Bamber
were
shot
and
killed
inside
their
farmhouse
,
along
with
their
adoptive
daughter
,
Sheila
Caffell
,
and
Sheila
's
six-year-old
twin
sons
,
Daniel
and
Nicholas
Caffell
.


The
only
surviving
member
of
June
and
Nevill
's
immediate
family
was
their
adoptive
son
,
Jeremy
Bamber
,
then
24
years
old
,
who
said
he
had
been
at
home
a
few
miles
away
when
the
shooting
took
place
.


The
police
at
first
believed
that
Sheila
,
diagnosed
with
schizophrenia
,
had
fired
the
shots
then
turned
the
gun
on
herself
.


But
weeks
after
the
murders
Jeremy
Bamber
's
ex-girlfriend
told
police
that
he
had
implicated
himself
.


The
prosecution
argued
that
,
motivated
by
a
large
inheritance
,
Bamber
had
shot
the
family
with
his
father
's
semi-automatic
rifle
,
then
placed
the
gun
in
his
unstable
sister
's
hands
to
make
it
look
like
a
murder–suicide
.


A
silencer
the
prosecution
said
was
on
the
rifle
would
have
made
it
too
long
,
they
argued
,
for
Sheila
's
fingers
to
reach
the
trigger
to
shoot
herself
.


Bamber
was
convicted
of
five
counts
of
murder
in
October
1986
by
a
10–2
majority
,
sentenced
to
a
minimum
of
25
years
,
and
informed
in
1994
that
he
would
never
be
released
.


The
Court
of
Appeal
upheld
the
verdict
in
2002
.


Bamber
protested
his
innocence
throughout
,
although
his
extended
family
remained
convinced
of
his
guilt
.


between
2004
and
2012
,
his
lawyers
submitted
several
unsuccessful
applications
to
the
criminal
cases
review
commission
.


They
argued
that
the
silencer
might
not
have
been
used
during
the
killings
,
that
the
crime
scene
may
have
been
damaged
then
reconstructed
,
that
crime-scene
photographs
were
taken
weeks
after
the
murders
,
and
that
the
time
of
Sheila
's
death
had
been
miscalculated
.


A
key
issue
was
whether
Bamber
received
a
call
from
his
father
that
night
to
say
Sheila
had
``
gone
berserk
''
with
a
gun
.


Bamber
said
that
he
did
,
that
he
alerted
police
,
and
that
Sheila
fired
the
final
shot
while
he
and
the
officers
were
standing
outside
the
house
.


It
became
a
central
plank
of
the
prosecution
's
case
that
the
father
had
made
no
such
call
,
and
that
the
only
reason
Bamber
would
have
lied
about
it—indeed
,
the
only
way
he
could
have
known
about
the
shootings
when
he
alerted
the
police—was
that
he
was
the
killer
himself
.


The
2010
Copiapó
mining
accident
,
also
known
then
as
the
``
Chilean
mining
accident
''
,
began
on
Thursday
,
5
August
2010
with
a
cave-in
at
the
San
José
copper–gold
mine
,
located
in
the
Atacama
Desert
north
of
the
regional
capital
of
Copiapó
,
in
northern
Chile
.


Thirty-three
men
,
trapped
underground
and
from
the
mine
's
entrance
via
spiraling
underground
ramps
,
were
rescued
after
69
days
.


After
the
state-owned
mining
company
,
Codelco
,
took
over
rescue
efforts
from
the
mine
's
owners
,
exploratory
boreholes
were
drilled
,
and
seventeen
days
after
the
accident
a
note
was
found
taped
to
a
drill
bit
pulled
back
to
the
surface
:
(
``
We
are
well
in
the
shelter
,
the
33
of
us
''
)
.


Three
separate
drilling
rig
teams
,
nearly
every
Chilean
government
ministry
,
the
United
States
'
NASA
space
agency
,
and
a
dozen
corporations
from
around
the
world
cooperated
completing
the
rescue
.


On
13
October
2010
the
men
were
winched
to
the
surface
one
at
a
time
,
in
a
specially
built
capsule
,
as
an
estimated
1
billion
people
worldwide
watched
.


With
few
exceptions
all
were
in
good
medical
condition
with
no
long-term
physical
effects
anticipated
.


Private
donations
covered
one-third
of
the
US
$
20
million
cost
of
the
rescue
,
with
the
rest
coming
from
the
mine
owners
and
the
government
.


Previous
geological
instability
at
the
old
mine
and
a
long
record
of
safety
violations
for
the
mine
's
owners
,
San
Esteban
Mining
Company
,
had
resulted
in
a
series
of
fines
and
accidents
,
including
eight
deaths
,
during
the
dozen
years
leading
up
to
this
accident
.


Following
three
years
of
work
,
lawsuits
and
investigations
into
the
collapse
concluded
in
August
2013
with
no
charges
filed
.


The
Han–Xiongnu
War
,
also
known
as
the
Sino-Xiongnu
War
,
was
a
series
of
military
battles
fought
between
the
Chinese
Han
Empire
and
the
Xiongnu
confederation
from
133
BC
to
89
AD
.


Starting
from
Emperor
Wu
's
reign
(
r.
141–87
BC
)
,
the
Han
empire
changed
from
a
relatively
passive
foreign
policy
to
an
offensive
strategy
to
deal
with
the
increasing
Xiongnu
incursions
on
the
northern
frontier
and
also
according
to
general
imperial
policy
to
expand
the
domain
.


In
133
BC
,
the
conflict
escalated
to
a
full-scale
war
when
the
Xiongnu
realized
that
the
Han
were
about
to
ambush
their
raiders
at
Mayi
.


The
Han
court
decided
to
deploy
several
military
expeditions
towards
the
regions
situated
in
the
Ordos
Loop
,
Hexi
Corridor
and
Gobi
Desert
in
a
successful
attempt
to
conquer
it
and
expel
the
Xiongnu
.


Hereafter
,
the
war
progressed
further
towards
the
many
smaller
states
of
the
Western
Regions
.


The
nature
of
the
battles
varied
through
time
,
with
many
casualties
during
the
changes
of
territorial
possession
and
political
control
over
the
western
states
.


Regional
alliances
also
tended
to
shift
,
sometimes
forcibly
,
when
one
party
gained
the
upper
hand
in
a
certain
territory
over
the
other
.


Han
Empire
eventually
prevailed
over
the
northern
nomads
,
and
the
war
allowed
the
Han
Empire
's
political
influence
expanded
deeply
into
Central
Asia
.


As
the
situation
deteriorated
for
the
Xiongnu
,
civil
conflicts
befell
and
further
weakened
the
confederation
,
which
eventually
splitted
into
two
groups
.


The
Southern
Xiongnu
submitted
to
the
Han
Empire
,
but
the
Northern
Xiongnu
continued
to
resist
and
was
eventually
evicted
westwards
by
the
further
expeditions
from
Han
Empire
and
its
vassals
,
and
the
rise
of
Donghu
states
like
Xianbei
.


Marked
by
significant
events
involving
the
conquests
over
various
smaller
states
for
control
and
many
large-scale
battles
,
the
war
resulted
in
the
total
victory
of
the
Han
empire
over
the
Xiongnu
state
in
89
AD
.


The
Battle
of
Rügen
was
a
naval
battle
near
the
island
of
Rügen
(
in
modern
Germany
)
,
that
took
place
on
21
May
1565
between
an
allied
fleet
of
6
Danish
and
3
Lübeck
ships
,
and
a
Swedish
fleet
of
48
ships
with
a
total
of
1,638
guns
and
8,000
men
under
Klas
Horn
.


The
Swedish
fleet
was
victorious
,
and
4
of
the
allied
ships
were
burned
,
while
the
remaining
5
were
captured
.


On
21
May
,
eight
Danish
ship
were
found
north
of
Pomerania
.


They
were
there
to
prevent
Swedish
ships
getting
to
or
from
Greifswald
.


Four
of
the
ships
fled
into
Greifswald
to
escape
the
Swedes
but
they
chose
to
burn
the
other
four
ships
to
prevent
them
falling
into
enemy
hands
.


Klas
Horn
planned
to
attack
them
inside
the
harbor
,
but
after
negotiations
with
the
Duke
of
Pomerania
,
it
was
decided
that
the
ships
would
be
taken
care
of
by
the
Duke
on
behalf
of
Sweden
,
pending
a
peace
agreement
,
and
their
flags
submitted
to
the
Swedish
admiral
.


Hurricane
Klaus
was
a
North
Atlantic
hurricane
that
hit
the
Leeward
Islands
from
the
west
in
November
of
the
1984
Atlantic
hurricane
season
.


Forming
from
a
broad
area
of
low
pressure
on
November
5
,
Klaus
maintained
a
northeast
movement
throughout
much
of
its
path
.


After
making
landfall
on
extreme
eastern
Puerto
Rico
,
it
passed
to
the
north
of
the
Leeward
Islands
,
resulting
in
strong
southwesterly
winds
and
rough
seas
.


Klaus
attained
hurricane
status
and
reached
peak
winds
of
90
mph
(
145
km/h
)
before
becoming
extratropical
over
cooler
waters
on
November
13
.


The
storm
dropped
heavy
rainfall
in
Puerto
Rico
,
causing
minor
flooding
and
light
damage
.


Klaus
caused
heavy
marine
damage
in
the
Leeward
Islands
,
including
wrecking
at
least
three
ships
.


The
Virgin
Islands
experienced
heavy
damage
as
well
.

The
2015
Sampson
Flat
Fire
was
a
bushfire
in
Australia
in
the
state
of
South
Australia
,
the
area
affected
was
predominantly
the
Northern
Adelaide
Hills
and
the
outer
Adelaide
metropolitan
area
.


The
fire
began
on
2
January
2015
during
a
day
of
extreme
heat
and
lasted
until
9
January
2015
.


The
fire
began
in
a
semi
rural
area
to
the
north
east
of
the
city
,
in
the
locality
of
Sampson
Flat
.


it
later
travelled
southeast
towards
the
unk
township
and
across
the
mount
lofty
ranges
.


,
at
least
26
houses
were
destroyed
with
37
families
in
temporary
accommodation
.


This
count
had
increased
to
38
houses
,
125
outbuildings
and
134
injuries
by
the
evening
of
6
January
.


The
area
around
Kersbrook
was
worst
hit
,
with
twelve
houses
destroyed
.


On
7
January
,
the
number
of
houses
destroyed
throughout
the
affected
area
was
revised
down
from
38
to
32
and
again
down
to
27
a
few
days
later
.


There
were
no
fatalities
as
a
result
of
the
bushfires
;
and
the
total
cost
was
estimated
to
be
more
than
13
million
.


at
the
same
time
,
a
smaller
fire
threat
was
posed
near
and
in

The
Battle
of
Orthez
(
27
February
1814
)
saw
the
Anglo-Portuguese
Army
under
Field
Marshal
Arthur
Wellesley
,
Marquess
of
Wellington
attack
an
Imperial
French
army
led
by
Marshal
Nicolas
Soult
in
southern
France
.


The
outnumbered
French
repelled
several
Allied
assaults
on
their
right
flank
,
but
their
center
and
left
flank
were
overcome
and
Soult
was
compelled
to
retreat
.


at
first
the
withdrawal
was
conducted
in
good
order
,
but
it
eventually
ended
in
a
scramble
for
safety
and
many
french
soldiers
became
prisoners
.


The
engagement
occurred
near
the
end
of
the
Peninsular
War
.


In
mid-February
,
Wellington
's
army
broke
out
of
its
small
area
of
conquered
territory
near
Bayonne
.


Moving
east
,
the
Allies
drove
the
French
back
from
several
river
lines
.


After
a
pause
in
the
campaign
,
the
western-most
Allied
corps
surrounded
and
isolated
Bayonne
.


Resuming
their
eastward
drive
,
the
remaining
two
Allied
corps
pushed
Soult
's
army
back
to
Orthez
where
the
French
marshal
offered
battle
.


In
subsequent
operations
,
Soult
decided
to
abandon
the
large
western
port

Grand
Final
despite
being
in
the
competition
since
1925
,
came
into
the
game
as
minor
premiers
and
favourites
.


Footscray

they
kicked
six
goals
to
just
one
by

did
not
appear

The
2004
Haitian
coup
d'état
occurred
after
conflicts
lasting
for
several
weeks
in
Haiti
during
February
2004
.


It
resulted
in
the
removal
from
office
of
President
Jean-Bertrand
Aristide
preventing
him
from
finishing
his
second
term
,
and
he
left
Haiti
on
a
United
States
(
U.S.
)
plane
accompanied
by
U.S.
military/security
personnel
.


Aristide
claims
that
his
departure
was
a
kidnapping
,
accusing
the
U.S.
of
orchestrating
a
coup
d'état
against
him
.


Aristide
was
forced
into
exile
,
being
flown
directly
out
of
Haiti
to
the
Central
African
Republic
,
eventually
settling
in

The
Sinjar
massacre
was
the
genocidal
killing
and
abduction
of
thousands
of
Yazidi
men
in
Sinjar
(
``
Şingal
''
)
city
and
Sinjar
District
in
Iraq
's
Nineveh
Governorate
by
the
Islamic
terror
group
Islamic
State
of
Iraq
and
the
Levant
(
ISIS
)
in
August
2014
.


This
event
started
with
ISIL
attacking
and
capturing
Sinjar
and
neighboring
towns
on
3
August
,
during
ISIL
's
offensive
in
early
August
2014
.


Dr
Noori
Abdulrahman
,
head
of
the
Department
of
Coordination
and
Follow-up
of
the
Iraqi
Kurdistan
Regional
Government
,
stated
that
ISIL
's
3
August
campaign
against
Sinjar
was
more
about
demography
and
strategy
than
about
religion
.


According
to
Abdulrahman
,
ISIL
wanted
to
push
most
of
the
Kurds
out
of
strategic
Yazidi
areas
and
bring
in
Arabs
,
obedient
to
ISIL
.


On
8
August
2014
,
the
United
States
reacted
with
airstrikes
on
ISIL
units
and
convoys
in
northern
Iraq
,
which
led
to
a
war
of
several
countries
against
ISIL
.


The
assistance
of
PKK
and
YPG
enabled
the
majority
of
the
50,000
Yazidis
who
fled
into
the
Sinjar
Mountains
to
be
evacuated
.


On
17
December
2014
,
the
Kurdish
Peshmerga
,
PKK
and
YPG
forces
started
the
December
2014
Sinjar
offensive
with
the
support
of
US
airstrikes
.


This
offensive
broke
ISIL
's
troop
transport
routes
and
supply
lines
between
Mosul
and
Raqqa
,
the
largest
ISIL-controlled
cities
in
Iraq
and
Syria
at
the
time
.


The
Ariel
Castro
kidnappings
took
place
between
2002
and
2004
when
Ariel
Castro
kidnapped
Michelle
Knight
,
Amanda
Berry
,
and
Georgina
``
Gina
''
DeJesus
and
held
them
captive
in
his
home
in
the
Tremont
neighborhood
of
Cleveland
,
Ohio
.


They
were
imprisoned
until
May
6
,
2013
,
when
Berry
escaped
with
her
six-year-old
daughter
,
to
whom
she
had
given
birth
while
imprisoned
,
and
contacted
the
police
.


Police
rescued
Knight
and
DeJesus
and
arrested
Castro
within
hours
.


On
May
8
,
2013
,
Castro
was
charged
with
four
counts
of
kidnapping
and
three
counts
of
rape
.


He
pleaded
guilty
to
937
criminal
counts
of
rape
,
kidnapping
,
and
aggravated
murder
,
as
part
of
a
plea
bargain
.


He
was
sentenced
to
life
plus
1,000
years
in
prison
without
the
possibility
of
parole
.


One
month
into
his
sentence
,
he
committed
suicide
by
hanging
himself
with
bed
sheets
in
his
prison
cell
.


On

August
1976
,
SAETA
Flight
232
en
route
from
Quito
,
Ecuador
,
to
Cuenca
was
reported
missing
while
in
flight
.


The
SAETA-operated
Vickers
Viscount
785D
carried
55
passengers
and
4
crew
members
.


Searches
of
the
possible
crash
area
produced
no
results
.


A
mid-route
crash
on
the
stratovolcano
Chimborazo
was
considered
to
be
most
probable
,
though
some
speculated
a
guerrilla
hijacking
.


The
plane
was
eventually
found
at
5,310m
in
October
2002
by
two
members
of
the
Nuevos
Horizontes
mountaineering
club
,
Pablo
Chiquiza
and
Flavio
Armas
,
while
exploring
a
new
route
to
the
summit
of
Chimborazo
via
the
Garcia
Moreno
Glacier
.


However
,
they
did
not
report
it
immediately
.


The
discovery
was
n't
confirmed
until
February
2003
,
when
a
team
hired
by
the
television
station
Teleamazonas
went
up
to
film
a
video
of
the
wreckage
,
and
found
human
remains
,
newspapers
from
the
day
the
plane
disappeared
and
identification
cards
of
known
passengers
.


The
Mapenduma
hostage
crisis
began
on
8
January
1996
after
the
Free
Papua
Movement
(
(
OPM
)
)
took
26
members
of
a
World
Wildlife
Fund
research
mission
captive
at
Mapenduma
,
Jayawijaya
in
Irian
Jaya
(
now
Papua
Province
)
,
Indonesia
.


The
hostages
were
subsequently
moved
to
Geselama
.


The
International
Committee
of
the
Red
Cross
acted
as
an
intermediary
between
the
OPM
and
the
Indonesian
authorities
.


Fifteen
hostages
,
all
of
Indonesian
nationality
,
were
released
relatively
quickly
,
but
eleven
(
comprising
four
Britons
,
two
Dutch
,
and
five
Indonesians
)
remained
in
OPM
hands
.


After
lengthy
negotiations
the
ICRC
secured
an
agreement
for
the
release
of
the
remaining
hostages
on
8
May
.


However
,
the
OPM
leader
,
Kelly
Kwalik
,
backed
out
of
the
agreement
on
the
day
of
the
intended
release
.


The
ICRC
removed
itself
from
the
negotiations
and
stated
that
the
Indonesian
Army
was
no
longer
bound
by
an
agreement
not
to
engage
in
combat
with
the
hostage
takers
.


On
9
May
Indonesian
Army
Special
Forces
(
Kopassus
)
moved
into
the
village
but
found
it
unoccupied
.


Five
personnel
were
killed
in
a
helicopter
crash
.


A
small
observation
force
was
left
behind
and
,
after
this
confirmed
the
OPM
and
their
hostages
had
returned
to
the
site
on
15
May
,
a
second
assault
was
made
.


This
was
successful
and
effected
the
release
of
nine
of
the
hostages
,
two
being
killed
by
their
captors
.


Eight
OPM
fighters
were
killed
and
two
captured
versus
no
loss
on
the
Indonesian
side
,
save
for
the
helicopter
crash
.


There
was
some
international
controversy
over
the
use
of
an
unmarked
civilian
helicopter
by
the
Indonesian
forces
,
which
may
have
misled
the
OPM
.


The
German
invasion
of
Belgium
was
a
military
campaign
which
began
on
4
August
1914
.


Earlier
,
on
24
July
,
the
Belgian
government
had
announced
that
if
war
came
it
would
uphold
its
historic
neutrality
.


The
Belgian
government
mobilised
its
armed
forces
on
31
July
and
a
state
of
heightened
alert
(
)
was
proclaimed
in
Germany
.


On
2
August
,
the
German
government
sent
an
ultimatum
to
Belgium
,
demanding
passage
through
the
country
,
and
German
forces
invaded
Luxembourg
.


Two
days
later
,
the
Belgian
government
refused
the
demands
and
the
British
government
guaranteed
military
support
to
Belgium
.


The
German
government
declared
war
on
Belgium
on
4
August
,
troops
crossed
the
border
and
began
the
Battle
of
Liège
.


German
military
operations
in
Belgium
were
intended
to
bring
the
1st
,
2nd
and
3rd
armies
into
positions
in
Belgium
from
which
they
could
invade
France
,
which
,
after
the
fall
of
Liège
on
7
August
,
led
to
sieges
of
Belgian
fortresses
along
the
Meuse
river
at
Namur
and
the
surrender
of
the
last
forts
(
16–17
August
)
.


The
government
abandoned
the
capital
,
Brussels
,
on
17
August
and
after
fighting
on
the
Gete
river
,
the
Belgian
field
army
withdrew
westwards
to
the
National
Redoubt
at
Antwerp
on
19
August
.


Brussels
was
occupied
the
following
day
and
the
Siege
of
Namur
began
on
21
August
.


After
the
Battle
of
Mons
and
the
Battle
of
Charleroi
,
the
bulk
of
the
German
armies
marched
south
into
France
,
leaving
small
forces
to
garrison
Brussels
and
the
Belgian
railways
.


The
III
Reserve
Corps
advanced
to
the
fortified
zone
around
Antwerp
and
a
division
of
the
IV
Reserve
Corps
took
over
in
Brussels
.


the
belgian
field
army
made
several
sorties
from
antwerp
in
late
august
and
september
to
harass
german
communications
and
to
assist
the
french
and
the
british
expeditionary
force
(
bef
)
,
by
keeping
german
troops
in
belgium
.


German
troop
withdrawals
to
reinforce
the
main
armies
in
France
were
postponed
to
repulse
a
Belgian
sortie
from
9
to
13
September
and
a
German
corps
in
transit
was
retained
in
Belgium
for
several
days
.


Belgian
resistance
and
German
fear
of
francs-tireurs
,
led
the
Germans
to
implement
a
policy
of
terror
(
)
against
Belgian
civilians
soon
after
the
invasion
,
in
which
massacres
,
executions
,
hostage
taking
and
the
burning
of
towns
and
villages
took
place
and
became
known
as
the
Rape
of
Belgium
.


After
the
Battle
of
the
Frontiers
ended
,
the
French
armies
and
the
BEF
began
the
Great
Retreat
into
France
,
the
Belgian
army
and
small
detachments
of
French
and
British
troops
fought
in
Belgium
against
German
cavalry
and
.


on
27
august
,
a
squadron
of
the
royal
naval
air
service
(
rnas
)
flew
to
ostend
,
to
conduct
air
reconnaissance
between
bruges
,
ghent
and
ypres
.


Royal
Marines
landed
in
France
on
and
began
scouting
unoccupied
Belgium
in
motor
cars
;
an
RNAS
Armoured
Car
Section
was
created
by
fitting
vehicles
with
bulletproof
steel
.


On
2
October
,
the
Marine
Brigade
of
the
Royal
Naval
Division
was
moved
to
Antwerp
,
followed
by
the
rest
of
the
division
on
6
October
.


From
6
to
7
October
,
the
7th
Division
and
the
3rd
Cavalry
Division
landed
at
Zeebrugge
and
naval
forces
collected
at
Dover
were
formed
into
the
Dover
Patrol
,
to
operate
in
the
Channel
and
off
the
French–Belgian
coast
.


Despite
minor
British
reinforcement
,
the
Siege
of
Antwerp
ended
when
its
defensive
ring
of
forts
was
destroyed
by
German
super-heavy
artillery
.


The
city
was
abandoned
on
9
October
and
Allied
forces
withdrew
to
West
Flanders
.


at
the
end
of
the
great
retreat
,
the
race
to
the
sea
began
,
a
period
of
reciprocal
attempts
by
the
germans
and
franco-british
to
outflank
their
opponents
,
extending
the
front
line
northwards
from
the
aisne
,
into
picardy
,
artois
and
flanders
.


Military
operations
in
Belgium
also
moved
westwards
as
the
Belgian
army
withdrew
from
Antwerp
to
the
area
close
to
the
border
with
France
.


The
Belgian
army
fought
the

against

armies
.


By
November
1914
,
most
of
Belgium
was
under
German
occupation
and
Allied
naval
blockade
.


A
German
military
administration
was
established
on
26
August
1914
,
to
rule
through
the
pre-war
Belgian
administrative
system
,
overseen
by
a
small
group
of
German
officers
and
officials
.


Belgium
was
divided
into
administrative
zones
,
the
General
Government
of
Brussels
and
its
hinterland
;
a
second
zone
,
under
the
4th
Army
,
including
Ghent
and
Antwerp
and
a
third
zone
under
the
German
Navy
along
the
coastline
.


The
German
occupation
lasted
until
late
1918
.


the
nato
bombing
of
yugoslavia
was
the
north

treaty
organisation
's
(
nato
)
military
operation
against
the
federal
republic
of
yugoslavia
(
fry
)
during
the
kosovo
war
.


The
air
strikes
lasted
from
March
24
,
1999
to
June
10
,
1999
.


The
official
NATO
operation
code
name
was
``
Operation
Allied
Force
''
;
the
United
States
called
it
``
Operation
Noble
Anvil
''
,
while
in
Yugoslavia
,
the
operation
was
incorrectly
called
``
Merciful
Angel
''
(
/
``
Milosrdni
anđeo
''
)
,
as
a
result
of
a
misunderstanding
or
mistranslation
.


The
bombings
continued
until
an
agreement
was
reached
that
led
to
the
withdrawal
of
Yugoslav
armed
forces
from
Kosovo
,
and
the
establishment
of
United

Interim
Administration
Mission
in
Kosovo
(
UNMIK
)
,
a
UN
peacekeeping
mission
in
Kosovo
.


The
bloodshed
,
ethnic
cleansing
of
thousands
of
Albanians
driving
them
into
neighbouring
countries
,
and
the
potential
of
it
to
destabilize
the
region
provoked
intervention
by
international
organizations
and
agencies
,
such
as
the
United
Nations
,
NATO
,
and
INGOs
.


NATO
countries
attempted
to
gain
authorisation
from
the
United
Nations
Security
Council
for
military
action
,
but
were
opposed
by
China
and
Russia
that
indicated
they
would
veto
such
a
proposal
.


NATO
launched
a
campaign
without
UN
authorisation
,
which
it
described
as
a
humanitarian
intervention
.


The
FRY
described
the
NATO
campaign
as
an
illegal
war
of
aggression
against
a
sovereign
country
that
was
in
violation
of
international
law
because
it
did
not
have
UN
Security
Council
support
.


The
bombing
killed
between
489
and
528
civilians
,
and
destroyed
bridges
,
industrial
plants
,
public
buildings
,
private
businesses
,
as
well
as
barracks
and
military
installations
.


In
the
days
after
the
Yugoslav
army
withdrew
,
over
164,000
Serbs
and
24,000
Roma
left
Kosovo
and
many
of
the
remaining
non-Albanian
civilians
(
as
well
as
Albanians
perceived
as
collaborators
)
were
victims
of
abuse
which
included
beatings
,
abductions
and
murders
.


After
Kosovo
and
other
Yugoslav
Wars
,
Serbia
became
home
to
the
highest
number
of
refugees
and
IDPs
(
including
Kosovo
Serbs
)
in
Europe
.


The
NATO
bombing
marked
the
second
major
combat
operation
in
its
history
,
following
the
1995
NATO
bombing
campaign
in
Bosnia
and
Herzegovina
.


It
was
the
first
time
that
NATO
had
used
military
force
without
the
approval
of
the
UN
Security
Council
.


The
Geeta
and
Sanjay
Chopra
kidnapping
case
(
also
known
as
the
Ranga-Billa
case
)
was
a
kidnapping
and
murder
crime
in
New
Delhi
in
1978
.


It
involved
the
kidnapping
and
the
subsequent
murder
of
siblings
Geeta
and
Sanjay
by
Kuljeet
Singh
(
alias
Ranga
Khus
)
and
Jasbir
Singh
(
alias

)
.


The
children
were
kidnapped
for
ransom
but
,
on
learning
their
father
was
a
naval
officer
,
both
were
killed
.


Geeta
was
allegedly
raped
before
being
murdered
,
but
forensic
evidence
could
not
confirm
it
.


The
kidnappers
had
initially
admitted
to
raping
her
but
later
retracted
the
statement
.


The
two
kidnappers
were
convicted
and
sentenced
to
death
.


The
execution
was
carried
out
in
1982

The
Revolt
of
the
Altishahr
Khojas
was
an
uprising
against
the
Qing
dynasty
of
China
,
which
broke
out
in
1757
during
the
reign
of
the
Qianlong
Emperor
.


The
rebels
were
led
by
the
Younger
Khoja
(
also
known
as
Khwāja-i
Jahān
)
,
leader
of
the
.


Qing
era
documents
refer
to
the
event
as
the
``
Pacification
of
the
Muslim
regions
''
(
)
.


Hojijan
and
his
brother
,
the
Elder
Khoja
(
also
known
as
Burhān
al-Dīn
)
,
were
members
of
the
Central
Asian
Muslim
Zhuo
(
卓
)
Clan
.


After
the
Qing
at
the
end
of
the
Dzungar–Qing
Wars
in
1755
,
the
Khoja
Brothers
were
released
from
Dzungar
captivity
whereupon
they
began
to
recruit
followers
in
the
Western
Regions
around
Altishahr
.


Not
long
afterwards
,
the
Khoit-Oirat
prince
Amursana
rose
up
against
the
Qing
and
the
Khoja
Brothers
used
the
opportunity
to
seize
control
of
the
south
west
part
of
Xinjiang
.


In
1757
,
Hojijan
killed
the
Qing
Amindao
(
)
.


Qianlong
retaliated
the
following
year
by
sending
troops
to
locations
including
Kuqa
County
,
(
modern
day
Yarkant
County
)
and
Hotan
(
)
to
attack
the
Zhuo
brothers
.


In
1759
,
the
rebel
army
fled
west
through
the
Pamir
Mountains
to
Badakhshan
(
now
part
of
north
east
Afghanistan
)
where
it
was
captured
and
destroyed
by
the
ruling
Sultan
Shah
,
causing
the
revolt
to
subside
.


With
the
revolt
pacified
,
the
Qing
completed
the
reintegration
of
their
territory
in
one
of
Qianlong
's
Ten
Great
Campaigns
.


The
end
of
the
conflict
saw
the
restoration
of
the
territory
south
of
the
Tian
Shan
to
Qing
control
meaning
that
the
Qing
now
controlled
the
whole
of
Xinjiang
.


After
the
appointment
of
an
the
Xinjiang
area
remained
peaceful
for
the
next
60
years
.


The
1984
Mannar
massacre
was
the
killing
of
200+
minority
Sri
Lankan
Tamils
civilians
by
Sri
Lankan
Army
soldiers
in
the
town
of
Mannar
,
north-western
Sri
Lanka
,
on
December
4
,
1984
.


The
attack
was
triggered
when
three
Army
jeeps
hit
a
land
mine
,
killing
one
soldier
.


In
retaliation
,
landmarks
such
as
the
Central
hospital
,
the
post
office
,
a
Roman
Catholic
convent
as
well
as
villagers
working
in
rice
paddy
fields
and
bus
passengers
were
attacked
.


Villages
around
Mannar
town
such
as
Murunkan
and
Parappankadal
were
also
attacked
.


Immediately
after
the
incident
,
the
then
Sri
Lankan
President
J.
R.
Jayawardene
appointed
a
Presidential
commission
of
inquiry
.


A
local
Roman
Catholic
priest
,
Mary
Bastian
who
was
a
member
Presidential
commission
was
later
killed
on
January
1985
.


A
Methodist
minister
George
Jeyarajasingham
,
who
was
a
witness
to
the
incident
,
was
also
killed
in
December
1984
.


the
bombing
of
banski
dvori
(
)
was
a
yugoslav
air
force
strike
on
the
banski
dvori
in
unk
official
residence
of
the
president
of
croatia
at
the
time
of
the
croatian
war
of
independence
.


the
airstrike
occurred
on
7
october
1991
,
as
a
part
of
a
yugoslav
air
force
attack
on
a
number
of
targets
in
the
croatian
capital
city
.


One
civilian
was
reported
killed
by
strafing
of
the
Tuškanac
city
district
and
four
were
injured
.


At
the
time
of
the
attack
,
Croatian
President
Franjo
Tuđman
was
in
the
building
,
meeting
Stjepan
Mesić
,
then
President
of
the
Presidency
of
Yugoslavia
,
and
Ante
Marković
,
then
Prime
Minister
of
Yugoslavia
,
but
none
of
them
were
injured
in
the
attack
.


In
immediate
aftermath
,
Tuđman
remarked
that
the
attack
was
apparently
meant
to
destroy
the
Banski
dvori
as
the
seat
of
the
statehood
of
Croatia
.


Marković
blamed
Yugoslav
Defence
Secretary
General
Veljko
Kadijević
,
who
denied
the
accusation
and
suggested
the
event
was
staged
by
Croatia
.


The
attack
prompted
international
condemnation
and
consideration
of
economic
sanctions
against
Yugoslavia
.


The
presidential
residence
was
immediately
moved
to
the
Presidential
palace
,
which
was
formerly
known
as
``
Villa
Zagorje
''
.


The
Banski
dvori
sustained
significant
damage
,
but
repairs
started
only
in
1995
.


The
building
later
became
the
seat
of
the
Croatian
Government
.


the
battle
of
the
alamo
(
february
23
UNK
march
6
,
1836
)
was
a
pivotal
event
in
the
texas
revolution
.


Following
a
13-day
siege
,
Mexican
troops
under
President
General
Antonio
López
de
Santa
Anna
reclaimed
the
Alamo
Mission
near
San
Antonio
de
Béxar
(
modern-day
San
Antonio
,
Texas
,
United
States
)
,
killing
the
Texian
and
immigrant
occupiers
.


Santa
Anna
's
cruelty
during
the
battle
inspired
many
Texians
,
both
legal
Texas
settlers
and
illegal
immigrants
from
the
United
States
,
to
join
the
Texian
Army
.


Buoyed
by
a
desire
for
revenge
,
the
Texians
defeated
the
Mexican
Army
at
the
Battle
of
San
Jacinto
,
on
April
21
,
1836
,
ending
the
rebellion
.


Several
months
previously
,
Texians
had
driven
all
Mexican
troops
out
of
Mexican
Texas
.


About
100
Texians
were
then
garrisoned
at
the
Alamo
.


The
Texian
force
grew
slightly
with
the
arrival
of
reinforcements
led
by
eventual
Alamo
co-commanders
James
Bowie
and
William
B.
Travis
.


On
February
23
,
approximately
1,500
Mexicans
marched
into
San
Antonio
de
Béxar
as
the
first
step
in
a
campaign
to
retake
Texas
.


For
the
next
10
days
,
the
two
armies
engaged
in
several
skirmishes
with
minimal
casualties
.


Aware
that
his
garrison
could
not
withstand
an
attack
by
such
a
large
force
,
Travis
wrote
multiple
letters
pleading
for
more
men
and
supplies
from
Texas
and
from
the
United
States
,
but
the
Texians
were
reinforced
by
fewer
than
100
men
because
the
United
States
had
a
treaty
with
Mexico
,
and
supplying
men
and
weapons
would
have
been
an
overt
act
of
war
.


In
the
early
morning
hours
of
March
6
,
the
Mexican
Army
advanced
on
the
Alamo
.


After
repelling
two
attacks
,
the
Texians
were
unable
to
fend
off
a
third
attack
.


As
Mexican
soldiers
scaled
the
walls
,
most
of
the
Texian
fighters
withdrew
into
interior
buildings
.


Occupiers
unable
to
reach
these
points
were
slain
by
the
Mexican
cavalry
as
they
attempted
to
escape
.


Between
five
and
seven
Texians
may
have
surrendered
;
if
so
,
they
were
quickly
executed
.


Most
eyewitness
accounts
reported
between
182
and
257
Texians
died
,
while
most
historians
of
the
Alamo
agree
that
around
600
Mexicans
were
killed
or
wounded
.


Several
noncombatants
were
sent
to
Gonzales
to
spread
word
of
the
Texian
defeat
.


The
news
sparked
both
a
strong
rush
to
join
the
Texian
army
and
a
panic
,
known
as
``
The
Runaway
Scrape
''
,
in
which
the
Texian
army
,
most
settlers
,
and
the
new
,
self-proclaimed
but
officially
unrecognized
,
Republic
of
Texas
government
fled
eastward
toward
the
United
States
ahead
of
the
advancing
Mexican
Army
.


Within
Mexico
,
the
battle
has
often
been
overshadowed
by
events
from
the
Mexican–American
War
of
1846–48
.


In
19th-century
Texas
,
the
Alamo
complex
gradually
became
known
as
a
battle
site
rather
than
a
former
mission
.


The
Texas
Legislature
purchased
the
land
and
buildings
in
the
early
part
of
the
20th
century
and
designated
the
Alamo
chapel
as
an
official
Texas
State
Shrine
.


The
Alamo
has
been
the
subject
of
numerous
non-fiction
works
beginning
in
1843
.


Most
Americans
,
however
,
are
more
familiar
with
the
myths
and
legends
spread
by
many
of
the
movie
and
television
adaptations
,
including
the
1950s
Disney
mini-series
``
Davy
Crockett
''
and
John
Wayne
's
1960
film
``
The
Alamo
''
.


The
Battle
of
Chaeronea
was
fought
in
338
BC
,
near
the
city
of
Chaeronea
in
Boeotia
,
between
the
Macedonians
led
by
Philip
II
of
Macedon
and
an
alliance
of
some
of
the
Greek
city-states
led
by
Athens
and
Thebes
.


The
battle
was
the
culmination
of
Philip
's
final
campaigns
in
339-338
BC
and
resulted
in
a
decisive
victory
for
the
Macedonians
.


Philip
had
brought
peace
to
a
war-torn
Greece
in
346
BC
,
by
ending
the
Third
Sacred
War
,
and
concluding
his
ten-year
conflict
with
Athens
for
supremacy
in
the
north
Aegean
,
by
making
a
separate
peace
.


Philip
's
much
expanded
kingdom
,
powerful
army
and
plentiful
resources
now
made
him
the
``
de
facto
''
leader
of
Greece
.


To
many
of
the
fiercely
independent
city-states
,
Philip
's
power
after
346
BC
was
perceived
as
a
threat
,
especially
in
Athens
,
where
the
politician
Demosthenes
led
efforts
to
break
away
from
Philip
's
influence
.


In
340
BC
Demosthenes
convinced
the
Athenian
assembly
to
sanction
action
against
Philip
's
territories
and
to
ally
with
the
Achaemenids
in
Byzantium
,
which
Philip
was
besieging
.


These
actions
were
against
the
terms
of
their
treaty
oaths
and
amounted
to
a
declaration
of
war
.


In
summer
339
BC
,
Philip
therefore
led
his
army
towards
South
Greece
,
prompting
the
formation
of
an
alliance
of
a
few
southern
Greek
states
opposed
to
him
,
led
by
Athens
and
Thebes
.


After
several
months
of
stalemate
,
Philip
finally
advanced
into
Boeotia
in
an
attempt
to
march
on
Thebes
and
Athens
.


Opposing
him
,
and
blocking
the
road
near
Chaeronea
,
was
the
allied
army
,
similar
in
size
and
occupying
a
strong
position
.


Details
of
the
ensuing
battle
are
scarce
,
but
after
a
long
fight
the
Macedonians
crushed
both
flanks
of
the
allied
line
,
which
then
dissolved
into
a
rout
.


The
battle
has
been
described
as
one
of
the
most
decisive
of
the
ancient
world
.


The
forces
of
Athens
and
Thebes
were
destroyed
,
and
continued
resistance
was
impossible
;
the
war
therefore
came
to
an
abrupt
end
.


Philip
was
able
to
impose
a
settlement
upon
southern
Greece
,
which
all
states
accepted
,
with
the
exception
of
Sparta
.


The
League
of
Corinth
,
formed
as
a
result
,
made
all
participants
allies
of
Macedon
and
each
other
,
with
Philip
as
the
guarantor
of
the
peace
.


In
turn
,
Philip
was
voted
as
``
strategos
''
(
general
)
for
a
pan-Hellenic
war
against
the
Achaemenid
Empire
,
which
he
had
long
planned
.


However
,
before
he
was
able
to
take
charge
of
the
campaign
,
Philip
was
assassinated
,
and
the
Kingdom
of
Macedon
and
responsibility
for
the
war
with
Persia
passed
instead
to
his
son
Alexander
.

operating
from
Kukum
Field
on
Guadalcanal
.


The
mission
of
the
U.S.
aircraft
was
specifically
to
kill
Yamamoto
and
was
based
on
United
States
Navy
intelligence
on
Yamamoto
's
itinerary
in
the
Solomon
Islands
area
.


The
death
of
Yamamoto
reportedly
damaged
the
morale
of
Japanese
naval
personnel
,
raised
the
morale
of
the
Allied
forces
,
and
was
intended
as
revenge
by
U.S.
leaders
who
blamed
Yamamoto
for
the
attack
on
Pearl
Harbor
that
initiated
the
formal
state
of
war
between
Imperial
Japan
and
the
United
States
.


The
U.S.
pilots
claimed
to
have
shot
down
three
twin-engined
bombers
and
two
fighters
during
the
mission
,
but
Japanese
sources
show
only
two
bombers
were
shot
down
.


There
is
a
controversy
over
which
pilot
shot
down
Yamamoto
's
plane
.


Siege
of
Riga
by
the
Russian
Army
under
Tsar
Alexei
Mikhailovich
was
the
main
event
of
the
Russo-Swedish
War
.


The
fortifications
of
Riga
consisted
of
a
wall
with
ditch
and
5
bastions
around
the
old
town
.


In
1652
Swedes
had
started
construction
of
a
new
wall
with
12
bastions
around
suburbs
,
but
by
1656
the
work
had
not
been
completed
.


The
Russian
vanguard
consisting
of
the
Vladimir
v.
Vizin
reiters
,
Daniel
Krafert
infantry
and
Iunkmann
dragoons
approached
Riga
on
August
20
and
threw
back
the
Swedes
under
count
of
Pärnu
,
Heinrich
von
Thurn
into
the
city
.


Von
Thurn
was
either
killed
,
or
captured
in
the
action
.


The
Swedes
evacuated
the
suburbs
and
withdrew
to
the
old
town
.


A
few
days
later
,
the
main
army
under
Tsar
Alexei
Mikhailovich
arrived
on
the
ships
on
the
Duna
River
,
and
laid
siege
to
Riga
.


The
Russian
army
occupied
three
camps
,
two
on
the
east
bank
of
the
Duna
in
Riga
's
suburbs
,
and
a
Corps
under
Ordyn-Nashokin
on
the
west
bank
of
the
Duna
,
opposite
the
Kobrun
entrenchment
.


As
Russia
had
no
full-fledged
navy
to
intercept
reinforcements
coming
to
the
Swedish
garrison
across
the
Baltic
,
Riga
managed
to
hold
out
until
October
,
when
foreign
officers
commanding
a
small
Russian
flotilla
defected
to
the
other
side
and
the
Russians
had
to
lift
the
siege
.


In
the
aftermath
of
this
reverse
,
the
Swedes
recaptured
much
of
Ingria
,
took
the
Pskov
Monastery
of
the
Caves
and
inflicted
a
heavy
defeat
on
the
Russian
general
Matvey
Sheremetev
at
Valga
in
1657
.


The
events
of
the
siege
were
recorded
in
an
engraving
by
Adam
Perelli
that
was
first
published
in
1697
in
Samuel
Puffendorf
's
work
,
``

The
Cult
of
the
Lord
Holy
Christ
of
the
Miracles
(
)
,
popularly
known
as
``
Senhor
Santo
Cristo
''
or
``
Santo
Cristo
dos
Milagres
''
is
a
religious
veneration
associated
with
an
image
of
Jesus
Christ
,
depicted
in
the
events
of
the
New
Testament
(
presented
in
Luke
23:1-25
)
.


The
wooden
image
of
Christ
,
by
unknown
artist
,
in
a
Renaissance-style
representation
of
the
``
Ecce
Homo
''
,
represents
the
episode
of
Jesus
of
Nazareth
's
life
when
the
martyred
religious
figure
was
presented
to
the
crowd
following
his
whipping
,
and
includes
a
crown
of
thorns
,
uncovered
torso
and
bruised/beaten
body
.


Narrated
in
the
New
Testament
,
the
artist
represented
in
grande
artistic
style
the
contrast
between
violence
on
the
body
and
the
serenity
of
the
expression
,
emphasized
by
the
gaze
from
the
image
.


Normally
,
this
statue
and
piece
of
art
is
on
display
in
the
Sanctuary
of
the
Lord
Holy
Christ
,
in
the
Convent
of
Our
Lady
of
Hope
(
in
Ponta
Delgada
,
on
the
island
of
São
Miguel
in
the
Azores
)
,
but
annually
leads
a
procession
through
the
streets
of
the
city
.


The
festivals
in
honour
of
the
Lord
Holy
Christ
of
the
Miracles
occur
on
the
fifth
Sunday
after
Easter
,
the
day
on
which
a
great
procession
winds
the
streets
of
the
provincial
capital
,
and
terminating
on
the
Thursday
of
Ascension
.


These
events
are
the
most
and
oldest
religious
devotions
still
carried
out
in
Portugal
,
with
the
popular
feasts
at
the
Sanctuary
of
the
Sovereign
Mother
,
in
Loulé
,
and
the
20th
century
celebrations
in
honour
of
Our
Lady
of
Fátima
having
comparable
interest
.


Annually
,
the
celebrations
in
Ponta
Delgada
attract
thousands
of
Azoreans
,
Luso-descendants
and
peoples
from
the
various
islands
of
the
archipelago
to
São
Miguel
.


the
serbian
revolution
(
/
``
srpska
unk
''
)
was
a
national
uprising
and
constitutional
change
in
serbia
that
took
place
between
1804
and
1835
,
during
which
this
territory
evolved
from
an
ottoman
province
into
a
rebel
territory
,
a
constitutional
monarchy
and
modern
serbia
.


The
first
part
of
the
period
,
from
1804
to
1817
,
was
marked
by
a
violent
struggle
for
independence
from
the
Ottoman
Empire
with
two
armed
uprisings
taking
place
,
ending
with
a
ceasefire
.


The
later
period
(
1817–1835
)
witnessed
a
peaceful
consolidation
of
political
power
of
the
increasingly
autonomous
Serbia
,
culminating
in
the
recognition
of
the
right
to
hereditary
rule
by
Serbian
princes
in
1830
and
1833
and
the
territorial
expansion
of
the
young
monarchy
.


The
adoption
of
the
first
written
Constitution
in
1835
abolished
feudalism
and
serfdom
,
and
made
the
country
suzerain
.


the
term
``
serbian
revolution
''
was
coined
by
a
german
academic
historiographer
,
leopold
von
ranke
,
in
his
book
``
die
unk
revolution
''
,
published
in
1829
.


These
events
marked
the
foundation
of
modern
Serbia
.


The
period
is
further
divided
as
follows
:
``
The
Proclamation
''
(
1809
)
by
Karađorđe
in
the
capital
Belgrade
probably
represented
the
apex
of
the
first
phase
.


It
called
for
national
unity
,
drawing
on
Serbian
history
to
demand
the
freedom
of
religion
and
formal
,
written
rule
of
law
,
both
of
which
the
Ottoman
Empire
had
failed
to
provide
.


It
also
called
on
Serbs
to
stop
paying
taxes
to
the
Porte
,
deemed
unfair
as
based
on
religious
affiliation
.


Apart
from
dispensing
with
poll
tax
on
non-Muslims
(
jizya
)
,
the
revolutionaries
also
abolished
all
feudal
obligations
in
1806
,
only
15
years
after
the
French
revolution
,
peasant
and
serf
emancipation
thus
representing
a
major
social
break
with
the
past
.


The
rule
of
Miloš
Obrenović
consolidated
the
achievements
of
the
Uprisings
,
leading
to
the
proclamation
of
the
first
constitution
in
the
Balkans
and
the
establishment
of
the
first
Serbian
institution
of
higher
learning
still
in
existence
,
the
Great
Academy
of
Belgrade
(
1808
)
.


In
1830
and
again
in
1833
,
Serbia
was
recognized
as
an
autonomous
principality
,
with
hereditary
princes
paying
annual
tribute
to
the
Porte
.


Finally
,
``
de
facto
''
independence
came
in
1867
,
with
the
withdrawal
of
Ottoman
garrisons
from
the
principality
;
``
de
jure
''
independence
was
formally
recognized
at
the
Congress
of
Berlin
in
1878
.

The
Castro
Street
Fair
is
a
San
Francisco
LGBT
street
festival
and
fair
usually
held
on
the
first
Sunday
in
October
in
the
Castro
neighborhood
,
the
main
gay
neighborhood
and
social
center
in
the
city
.


The
fair
features
multiples
stages
with
live
entertainment
,
DJs
,
food
vendors
,
community-group
stalls
as
well
as
a
curated
artisan
alley
with
dozens
of
Northern
California
artists
.


Due
to
community
pressure
the
fair
restructured
the
organization
and
partnered
with
local
charities
to
collect
gate
donations
and
partner
with
groups
at
the
beverage
and
beer
booths
to
raise
money
for
those
charities
.


The
Castro
Street
Fair
was
founded
by
Harvey
Milk
,
and
the
group
he
led
,
the
Castro
Valley
Association
,
in
1974
.


It
attracted
over
5,000
people
.


The
event
's
popularity
grew
quickly
and
by
1977
,
the
attendance
reached
70,000
.


The
influx
of
visitors
helped
promote
the
Castro
district
's
growing
tourist
industry
.


Castro

Fair
is
one
of
San

's
many
street
fairs
,

These

The
Castro

takes
place
on

afternoon
of

The
Fall
of
Philadelphia
marked
the
fall
of
Philadelphia
,
the
last
independent
Christian
Greek
settlement
in
western
Asia
Minor
,
to
the
Muslim
Turks
of
the
Ottoman
Sultanate
.


Ironically
,
the
besieging
army
included
a
contingent
from
the
Byzantine
Empire
,
which
by
then
was
a
vassal
of
the
Ottomans
.


Prior
to
its
fall
,
the
city
had
evaded
the
fate
of
her
neighbours
by
paying
tribute
to
the
numerous
fanatical
ghazis
,
whose
bands
robbed
and
pillaged
any
who
did
not
pay
protection
money
(
``
jizya
''
)
,
although
the
city
was
not
officially
under
Islamic
law
.


In
theory
,
the
city
was
under
the
Byzantine
Empire
,
but
cut
off
by
a
sea
of
hostile
land
ensured
that
in
reality
the
city
remained
independent
.


In
1378
Manuel
II
Palaiologos
promised
to
hand
over
the
city
of
Philadelphia
to
the
Turks
in
return
for
the
Ottoman
sultan
's
aid
in
a
disastrous
Byzantine
civil
war
.


However
,
Manuel
seems
to
have
retracted
his
promise
,
since
it
was
not
until
1390
that
Bayezid
summoned
the
two
leaders
of
the
civil
war
,
John
VII
and
Manuel
II
,
and
ordered
them
to
accompany
the
besieging
force
.


The
city
was
taken
by
the
Turks
that
year
.


The
2010

was
a
catastrophic
magnitude
7.0

earthquake
,
with
an
epicenter
near
the
town
of
Léogâne
(
Ouest
)
and
approximately
west
of
Port-au-Prince
,
Haiti
's
capital
.


The
earthquake
occurred
at

.


By
24

52
aftershocks
measuring
4.5
or
greater
had
been
recorded
.


An
estimated
three
million
people
were
affected
by
the
quake
.


Death
toll
estimates
range
from
100,000
to
about
160,000
to
Haitian
government
figures
from
220,000
to
316,000
,
although
these
latter
figures
are
a
matter
of
some
dispute
.


The
government
of
Haiti
estimated
that
250,000
residences
and
30,000
commercial
buildings
had
collapsed
or
were
severely
damaged
.


The
nation
's
history
of
national
debt
,
prejudicial
trade
policies
by
other
countries
,
and
foreign
intervention
into
national
affairs
,
contributed
to
the
existing
poverty
and
poor
housing
conditions
that
increased
the
death
toll
from
the
disaster
.


The
earthquake
caused
major
damage
in
Port-au-Prince
,
Jacmel
and
other
cities
in

palace
,
the

.


Among
those

confusion
over
who
was
in

congestion
,
and

relief
work
.


Port-au-Prince
's
morgues
were
overwhelmed
with
tens
of
thousands
of
bodies
.


These
had
to
be
buried
in
mass
graves
.


As
rescues
tailed
off
,
supplies
,
medical
care
and
sanitation
became
priorities
.


Delays
in
aid
distribution
led
to
angry
appeals
from
aid
workers
and
survivors
,
and
looting
and
sporadic
violence
were
observed
.


On
22
January
,
the
United
Nations
noted
that
the
emergency
phase
of
the
relief
operation
was
drawing
to
a
close

on
the
following
day
,
the
Haitian
government
officially
called
off
the
search
for

,
when
an
Ottoman
fleet
under
Piri
Reis
attacked
Old
Muscat
,
in
modern
Oman
,
and
plundered
the
town
from
the
Portuguese
.


These
events
followed
the
important
Ottoman
defeat
in
the
Second
Siege
of
Diu
in
1546
,
which
put
a
stop
to
their
attempts
in
India
,
but
also
the
successful
Capture
of
Aden
(
1548
)
,
which
allowed
the
Ottomans
to
resist
the
Portuguese
in
the
northwestern
part
of
the
Indian
Ocean
.


The
city
,
before
then
a
possession
of
the
King
of
Hormuz
,
had
been
in
Portuguese
hands
since
1507
,
when
a
Portuguese
fleet
under
Afonso
de
Albuquerque
attacked
the
city
,
destroyed
it
,
and
then
came
back
soon
after
to
occupy
it
.


The
Ottomans
attempted
to
intervene
against
the
Portuguese
presence
,
and
four
Ottoman
ships
bombarded
the
city
in
1546
.


The
city
was
again
attacked
by
the
Ottomans
in
1552
with
a
larger
fleet
under
Piri
Reis
and
Seydi
Ali
Reis
.


The
ultimate
objective
was
to
seize
the
islands
of
Hormuz
and
Bahrain
,
in
order
to
block
Portuguese
access
to
the
Persian
Gulf
and
thus
reestablish
Ottoman
control
of
the
Indian
Ocean
Trade
.


The
Ottoman
force
consisted
in
4
galleons
,
25
galleys
,
and
850
troops
(
according
to
Diogo
do
Couto
,
the
Ottomans
had
15
galleys
and
1200
troops
)
.


The
recently
built
Fort
Al-Mirani
was
besieged
for
18
days
with
one
piece
of
Ottoman
artillery
brought
on
top
of
a
ridge
.


Lacking
food
and
water
,
the
60
Portuguese
garrison
and
its
commander
,
João
de
Lisboa
,
agreed
to
surrender
,
only
to
be
taken
as
captives
.


The
fort
was
captured
and
its
fortifications
destroyed
.


Soon
however
the
Ottomans
departed
.


Ultimately
,
they
managed
to
occupy
and
control
the
coasts
of
Yemen
,
Aden
and
Arabia
,
as
far
north
as
Basra
,
so
as
to
facilitate
their
trade
with
India
and
block
the
Portuguese
from
attacking
the
Hijaz
.


The
Ottomans
again
attacked
the
Portuguese
possessions
of
the
coast
of
India
in
1553
,
with
a
raid
on
the
Pearl
Fishery
Coast
of
South
India
around
Tuticorin
.


They
were
assisted
by
the
Marakkar
Muslims
of
Malabar
,
and
had
the
tacit
agreement
of
Vittula
Nayak
of
Madurai
.


52
Portuguese
were
captured
at
Punnaikayal
,
and
churches
were
burnt
down
.


The
Ottomans
failed
however
in
1553
against
a
Portuguese
fleet
at
sea
near
al-Fahl
.


Seydi
Ali
Reis
and
his
galleys
would
be
attacked
in
an
ambush
by
Portuguese
forces
while
he
was
trying
to
bring
back
his
float
from
Basra
to
Suez
in
August
1554
.


Three
Ottoman
galleys
would
again
occupy
Muscat
in
1581
,
letting
the
population
escape
,
before
the
city
again
fell
to
the
Portuguese
in
1588
.


The
Dacian
Wars
(
101–102
,
105–106
)
were
two
military
campaigns
fought
between
the
Roman
Empire
and
Dacia
during
Emperor
Trajan
's
rule
.


The
conflicts
were
triggered
by
the
constant
Dacian
threat
on
the
Danubian
province
of
Moesia
and
also
by
the
increasing
need
for
resources
of
the
economy
of
the
Empire
.


Trajan
turned
his
attention
to
Dacia
,
an
area
north
of
Macedon
and
Greece
and
east
of
the
Danube
that
had
been
on
the
Roman
agenda
since
before
the
days
of
Caesar
when
the
Dacians
defeated
a
Roman
army
at
the
Battle
of
Histria
.


In
AD
85
,
the
Dacians
swarmed
over
the
Danube
and
pillaged
Moesia
and
initially
defeated
the
army
that
Emperor
Domitian
sent
against
them
.


The
Romans
were
defeated
in
the
Battle
of
Tapae
in
88
and
a
truce
was
established
.


Emperor
Trajan
recommenced
hostilities
against
Dacia
and
,
following
an
uncertain
number
of
battles
,
defeated
the
Dacian
king
Decebalus
in
the
Second
Battle
of
Tapae
in
101
.


With
Trajan
's
troops
pressing
towards
the
Dacian
capital
Sarmizegetusa
Regia
,
Decebalus
once
more
sought
terms
.


Decebalus
rebuilt
his
power
over
the
following
years
and
attacked
Roman
garrisons
again
in
105
.


In
response
Trajan
again
marched
into
Dacia
,
besieging
the
Dacian
capital
in
the
Siege
of
Sarmizegetusa
,
and
razing
it
.


With
Dacia
quelled
,
Trajan
subsequently
invaded
the
Parthian
empire
to
the
east
,
his
conquests
expanding
the
Roman
Empire
to
its
greatest
extent
.


Rome
's
borders
in
the
east
were
indirectly
governed
through
a
system
of
client
states
for
some
time
,
leading
to
less
direct
campaigning
than
in
the
west
in
this
period
.


the
hebron
massacre
refers
to
the
killing
of
sixty-seven
or
sixty-nine
jews
on
24
august
1929
in
hebron
,
then
part
of
mandatory
palestine
,
by
arabs
incited
to
violence
by
rumors
that
jews
were
planning
to
seize
control
of
the
temple
mount
in
jerusalem
.


The
event
also
left
scores
seriously
wounded
or
maimed
.


Jewish
homes
were
pillaged
and
synagogues
were
ransacked
.


Some
of
the
435
Jews
who
survived
were
hidden
by
local
Arab
families
,
although
the
extent
of
this
phenomenon
is
debated
.


Soon
after
,
all
Hebron
's
Jews
were
evacuated
by
the
British
authorities
.


Many
returned
in
1931
,
but
almost
all
were
evacuated
at
the
outbreak
of
the
1936–39
Arab
revolt
in
Palestine
.


The
massacre
formed
part
of
the
1929
Palestine
riots
,
in
which
a
total
of
133
Jews
and
110
Arabs
were
killed
,
and
brought
the
centuries-old
Jewish
presence
in
Hebron
to
an
end
.


The
massacre
,
together
with
that
of
Jews
in
Safed
,
sent
shock
waves
through
Jewish
communities
in
Palestine
and
around
the
world
.


it
led
to
the
re-organization
and
development
of
the
jewish
paramilitary
organization
,
the
haganah
,
which
later
became
the
nucleus
of
the
israel
defense
forces
.


Intense
Tropical
Cyclone
Kalunde
was
the
strongest
storm
of
the
2002–03
South-West
Indian
Ocean
cyclone
season
.


The
eleventh
named
storm
and
sixth
cyclone
of
the
season
,
Kalunde
formed
on
March
4
from
an
area
of
disturbed
weather
east-southeast
of
Diego
Garcia
.


The
storm
steadily
strengthened
and
attained
severe
tropical
storm
intensity
on
March
6
.


After
starting
a
phase
of
rapid
deepening
,
Kalunde
attained
cyclone
intensity
the
next
day
.


Kalunde
attained
its
peak
intensity
on
March
8
,
as
an
intense
tropical
cyclone
.


It
maintained
its
peak
strength
for
a
day
;
shortly
thereafter
,
the
system
began
to
weaken
.


After
undergoing
an
eyewall
replacement
cycle
,
the
storm
brushed
Rodrigues
.


Shortly
after
doing
so
,
Kalunde
weakened
into
a
tropical
cyclone
and
later
a
severe
tropical
storm
.


Two
days
later
,
on
March
16
,
the
cyclone
transitioned
into
an
extratropical
cyclone
and
dissipated
the
next
day
.


Cyclone
Kalunde
brought
US
$
3.15
million
in
damage
to
Rodrigues
Island
.


A
total
of
1,600
homes
and
40
boats
were
damaged
.


Severe
coastal
damage
took
place
across
the
island
;
many
roads
were
washed
out
.


Power
outages
also
occurred
across
the
island
,
delaying
residents
access
to
information
pertaining
to
Kalunde
.


About
80
percent
of
the
drinking
water
was
contaminated
and
the
entire
food
crop
was
destroyed
.


However
,
no
deaths
were
reported
.


Operation
Aurora
was
a
series
of
cyber
attacks
conducted
by
advanced
persistent
threats
such
as
the
Elderwood
Group
based
in
Beijing
,
China
,
with
ties
to
the
People
's
Liberation
Army
.


First
publicly
disclosed
by
Google
on
January
12
,
2010
,
in
a
blog
post
,
the
attacks
began
in
mid-2009
and
continued
through
December
2009
.


The
attack
was
aimed
at
dozens
of
other
organizations
,
of
which
Adobe
Systems
,
Juniper
Networks
and
Rackspace
have
publicly
confirmed
that
they
were
targeted
.


According
to
media
reports
,
Yahoo
,
Symantec
,
Northrop
Grumman
,
Morgan
Stanley
and
Dow
Chemical
were
also
among
the
targets
.


As
a
result
of
the
attack
,
Google
stated
in
its
blog
that
it
plans
to
operate
a
completely
uncensored
version
of
its
search
engine
in
China
``
within
the
law
,
if
at
all
''
,
and
acknowledged
that
if
this
is
not
possible
it
may
leave
China
and
close
its
Chinese
offices
.


Official
Chinese
sources
claimed
this
was
part
of
a
strategy
developed
by
the
U.S.
government
.


the
attack
was
named
``
operation
aurora
''
by
dmitri
unk
,
vice
president
of
threat
research
at
cyber
security
company
mcafee
.


Research
by
McAfee
Labs
discovered
that
``
Aurora
''
was
part
of
the
file
path
on
the
attacker
's
machine
that
was
included
in
two
of
the
malware
binaries
McAfee
said
were
associated
with
the
attack
.


``
We
believe
the
name
was
the
internal
name
the
attacker
(
s
)
gave
to
this
operation
,
''
McAfee
Chief
Technology
Officer
George
Kurtz
said
in
a
blog
post
.


According
to
McAfee
,
the
primary
goal
of
the
attack
was
to
gain
access
to
and
potentially
modify
source
code
repositories
at
these
high
tech
,
security
and
defense
contractor
companies
.


``
[
The

''
says
Alperovitch
.


``
No
one
ever
thought
about
securing
them
,
yet
these
were
the
crown
jewels
of
most
of
these
companies
in
many
ways—much
more
valuable
than
any
financial
or
personally

data
that
they
may
have
and
spend
so
much
time
and
effort
protecting

Hurricane
Debbie
was
an
intense
and
long-lived
hurricane
that
formed
during
August
1969
.


The
fifth
tropical
cyclone
,
fourth
named
storm
,
third
hurricane
and
second
major
hurricane
of
the
1969
Atlantic
hurricane
season
,
Debbie
formed
on
August
14
in
the
southern
Atlantic
Ocean
and
took
a
general
northwesterly
path
until
turning
northward
into
the
central
Atlantic
.


The
storm
was
characterized
by
numerous
fluctuations
in
intensity
,
and
it
reached
winds
corresponding
to
Category
3
status
on
the
Saffir–Simpson
Hurricane
Scale
on
four
separate
occasions
.


The
hurricane
bypassed
the
island
of
Bermuda
to
the
southeast
on
August
22
,
before
ultimately
brushing
southeastern
Newfoundland
with
strong
winds
.


It
dissipated
over
the
cold
waters
east
of
Greenland
.


although
debbie
had
little
effect
on

,
it
was
extensively
researched

The
1995
Fox
River
Grove
bus–train
collision
was
a
grade
crossing
collision
that
killed
seven
students
riding
aboard
a
school
bus
in
Fox
River
Grove
,
Illinois
,
on
the
morning
of
October
25
,
1995
.


The
school
bus
,
driven
by
a
substitute
driver
,
was
stopped
at
a
traffic
light
with
the
rearmost
portion
extending
onto
a
portion
of
the
railroad
tracks
when
it
was
struck
by
a
Metra
Union
Pacific
/
Northwest
Line
train
en
route
to
Chicago
.


The
crash
involved
a
signalled
rail
crossing
located
very
near
a
highway
intersection
which
was
regulated
by
traffic
signals
.


The
devices
were
connected
and
operations
were
supposed
to
be
carefully
timed
and
coordinated
.


Such
locations
are
known
as
``
interconnected
crossings
''
within
the
industries
.


Highway
and
railroad
officials
had
each
received
numerous
complaints
from
the
public
about
the
insufficient
timing
of
the
warnings
provided
by
the
signals
in
the
year
prior
to
the
crash
,
and
citizens
later
told
of
situations
with
vehicles
unable
to
clear
the
tracks
in
a
timely
manner
.


The
National
Transportation
Safety
Board
(
NTSB
)
investigation
found
that
,
while
the
bus
driver
was
not
aware
that
a
portion
of
the
bus
was
on
the
tracks
as
she
should
have
been
,
the
timing
of
signals
was
so
insufficient
that
,
even
if
she
had
identified
the
hazard
as
the
train
approached
,
she
would
have
had
to
proceed
against
a
red
traffic
signal
into
the
highway
intersection
to
have
moved
out
of
the
train
's
path
.


Legislation
and
re-engineering
of
interconnected
crossings
across
the
state
of
Illinois
combined
with
greater
awareness
elsewhere
resulted
in
efforts
to
help
to
prevent
similar
crashes
from
recurring
.


Informational
decals
were
also
added
to
Illinois
school
buses
advising
drivers
of
the
length
of
each
bus
,
since
the
substitute
school
bus
driver
was
apparently
unaware
of
the
exact
length
of
the
bus
she
was
driving
.


Other
states
have
also
embraced
that
and
related
aspects
and
incorporated
them
into
their
school
bus
driver
training
curriculum
.


The
Fox
River
Grove
crash
stands
as
the
worst
crash
involving
a
Metra
train
in
its
history
,
and
one
of
the
worst
grade
crossing
crashes
in
U.S.
history
.


At
the
crash
site
,
the
improved
signaling
system
installed
after
the
crash
now
protects
the
passing
trains
and
motor
vehicle
traffic
.


Nearby
is
a
small
memorial
to
the
seven
high
school
students
killed
in
the
crash
.

Another
Starrcade
event
would
not
be
produced
for
another
seventeen
years
,
when
WWE
used
the
name
for
a
special
live
event
in
2017
.


The
main
event
was
between
Scott
Steiner
and
Sid
Vicious
for
the
WCW
World
Heavyweight
Championship
.


Shortly
after
Steiner
won
the
title
at
Mayhem
,
the
previous
pay-per-view
event
,
Vicious
was
scheduled
to
face
Steiner
for
the
title
at
Starrcade
.


Their
feud
continued
after
the
event
until
Sin
,
the
following
event
,
when
a
severe
injury
forced
Vicious
to
leave
professional
wrestling
.


The
event
also
included
a
tag
team
match
between
The
Perfect
Event
and
The
Insiders
for
the
WCW
World
Tag
Team
Championship
and
a
match
between
Lex
Luger
and

were
made
available
on
the

The
Lagos
Countdown
,
now
One
Lagos
Fiesta
,
is
an
annual
New
Year
's
Eve
event
at
the
Bar
Beach
in
Lagos
.


The
event
lasts
for
21–23
days
and
traditionally
begins
on
the
7th
or
8
December
and
lasts
through
January
1
of
the
new
year
.


The
first
Lagos
Countdown
was
held
in
2012
as
an
attempt
to
drive
up
tourism
and
make
an
event
similar
to
New
Year
's
events
in
New
York
,
Sydney
,
and
other
major
cities
,
and
in
2013
an
estimated
200,000
people
celebrated
the
event
during
a
ten-day
period
and
earned
the
city
about
one
billion
naira
.


Festivities
for
the
countdown
typically
include
fireworks
,
live
music
concerts
,
and
karaoke
.


Performers
at
various
countdowns
have
included
Tuface
Idibia
,
Olamide
,
and
Funke
Akindele
,
and
previous
countdown
sponsors
have
included
Airtel
Nigeria
.


The
2013
Lagos
Countdown
was
met
with
criticism
from
some
participants
as
ticket
distribution
was
held
differently
from
the
2012
event
,
as
tickets
were
not
free
and
required
that
many
participants
purchase
their
own
tickets
via
scalpers
or
to
acquire
tickets
via
Countdown
sponsors
.


When
asked
about
this
,
the
corporate
affairs
manager
of
LASAA
responded
that
while
tickets
were
not
intended
to
have
been
sold
,
the
different
distribution
tactics
were
enacted
as
a
form
of
crowd
control
and
to
avoid
potential
issues
due
to
overcrowded
space
.


Lagos
Countdown
was
renamed
One
Lagos
Fiesta
in
2015
.

people
,
including
many

The

The
city
of
Danzig
(
Gdańsk
)
was
captured
by
the
State
of
the
Teutonic
Order
on
13
November
1308
,
resulting
in
a
massacre
of
its
inhabitants
and
marking
the
beginning
of
tensions
between
Poland
and
the
Teutonic
Order
.


Originally
the
knights
moved
into
the
fortress
as
an
ally
of
Poland
against
the
Margraviate
of
Brandenburg
.


However
,
after
disputes
over
the
control
of
the
city
between
the
Order
and
the
King
of
Poland
arose
,
the
knights
murdered
a
number
of
citizens
within
the
city
and
took
it
as
their
own
.


Thus
the
event
is
also
known
as
Gdańsk
massacre
or
Gdańsk
slaughter
(
``
rzeź
Gdańska
''
)
.


though
in
the
past
,
a
matter
of
debate
among
historians
,
a
consensus
has
been
established
that
many
people
were
murdered
and
a
considerable
part
of
the
town
was
destroyed
in
the
context
of
the
take-over
.


in
the
aftermath
of
the
take-over
,
the
order
seized
all
of
pomerelia
(
UNK
pomerania
)
and
bought
up
the
supposed
brandenburgian
claims
to
the
region
in
the
treaty
of
soldin
(
1309
)
.


the
conflict
with
poland
was
temporarily
settled
in
the
treaty
of

The
town
was
returned
to
Poland
in

had
unknowingly
disengaged

.


The
autopilot
then
disengaged
completely
causing
the
aircraft
to
roll
into
a
steep

a
near-vertical

;
the

managed
to
level
the

off
once
more

by
then
the

lost
too
much
altitude
to
recover

,
operating
under
the
control
of
a

,
misidentified
two

black
hawk
helicopters
as

helicopters
.


The
F-15

fired
on
and
destroyed
both

civilians
aboard
,
including
personnel
from
the
United
States
,
United
Kingdom
,
France
,
Turkey
,
and
the
Kurdish
community
.


A
subsequent
USAF
investigation
blamed
the
accident
on
several
factors
.


The
F-15
pilots
were
faulted
for
misidentifying
the
helicopters
as
hostile
.


Also
,
the
crew
members
of
the
AWACS
aircraft
were
blamed
for
their
inaction
in
failing
to
exercise
appropriate
control
and
for
not
intervening
in
the
situation
.


In
addition
,
the
identification
friend
or
foe
(
IFF
)
systems
had
not
functioned
to
identify
the
helicopters
to
the
F-15
pilots
.


Furthermore
,
USAF
leaders
had
failed
to
adequately
integrate
U.S.
Army
helicopter
operations
into
overall
OPC
air
operations
.


As
a
result
of
the
investigation
several
USAF
officers
received
administrative
discipline
but
only
one
,
Jim
Wang
,
an
AWACS
crew
member
,
was
tried
by
court-martial
,
in
which
he
was
acquitted
.


as
a
result
of
complaints
by
family
members
of
the
victims
and
others
that
the
military
was
failing
to
hold
its
personnel
accountable
,
the
u.s.
senate
and
u.s.
house
conducted
their
own
investigations
into
the
shootdown

taken
by

usaf
against
the
officers
involved
in
the
incident
.


Fogleman
's
investigation
led
to
several
of
the
officers
involved
in
the
incident
receiving
further
administrative
discipline
.


the
u.s.
department
of

(

subpoenas
for
four

to
be
interviewed
for

released
.


the
u.s.
house
investigation
,
conducted
in
part
by
the

accountability
office
(

)
,
found
that
the
military
investigative
and
judicial
systems
had
operated
mostly
as
designed
,
but
also
noted
that
the
dod
had
refused

Germany
on
3
September
1939
,
and
ended
with
the
German
invasion
of
France
and
the
Low
Countries
on
10
May
1940
.


although
there
was
no
large-scale
military
action
by
britain
and
france
,
they
did
begin
economic
warfare
,
especially
with
the
naval
blockade
,
and
shut
down
german
surface
raiders
.


They
created
elaborate
plans
for
numerous
large-scale
operations
designed
to
swiftly
and
decisively
cripple
the
German
war
effort
.


These
included
opening
an
Anglo-French
front
in
the
Balkans
,
invading
Norway
to
seize
control
of
Germany
's
main
source
of
iron
ore
and
a
strike
against
the
Soviet
Union
,
to
cut
off
its
supply
of
oil
to
Germany
.


Only
the
Norway
plan
came
to
fruition
,
and
it
was
too
little
too
late
in
April
1940
.


The
quiet
of
the
Phoney
War
was
punctuated
by
a
few
Allied
actions
.


In
the
Saar
Offensive
in
September
,
the
French
attacked
Germany
with
the
intention
of
assisting
Poland
,
but
it
fizzled
out
within
days
and
they
withdrew
.


In
November
,
the
Soviets
attacked
Finland
in
the
Winter
War
,
resulting
in
much
debate
in
France
and
Britain
about
an
offensive
to
help
Finland
,
but
the
forces
finally
assembled
for
this
campaign
were
delayed
until
it
ended
in
March
.


The
Allied
discussions
about
a
Scandinavian
campaign
caused
concern
in
Germany
and
resulted
in
the
German
invasion
of
Denmark
and
Norway
in
April
,
and
the
Allied
troops
previously
assembled
for
Finland
were
redirected
to
Norway
instead
.


Fighting
there
continued
until
June
when
the
Allies
evacuated
,
ceding
Norway
to
Germany
in
response
to
the
German
invasion
of
France
.


On
the
Axis
side
,
the
Germans
launched
attacks
at
sea
in
the
autumn
and
winter
against
British
aircraft
carriers
and
destroyers
,
sinking
several
including
the
carrier
with
the
loss
of
519
lives
.


Action
in
the
air
began
on
16
October
1939
when
the
Luftwaffe
launched
air
raids
on
British
warships
.


There
were
various
minor
bombing
raids
and
reconnaissance
flights
on
both
sides
.


California

The
California
Jam
attracted
300,000–400,000
paying
music
fans
.


The
festival
set
what
were
then
records
for
the
loudest
amplification
system
ever
installed
,
the
highest
paid
attendance
,
and
highest
gross
in
history
.


It
was
the
last
of
the
original
wave
of
rock
festivals
,
as
well
as
one
of
the
most
well-executed
and
financially
successful
,
and
presaged
the
era
of
media
consolidation
and
the
corporatization
of
the
rock
music
industry
.


The
Gorlice–Tarnów
Offensive
during
World
War
I
was
initially
conceived
as
a
minor
German
offensive
to
relieve
Russian
pressure
on
the
Austro-Hungarians
to
their
south
on
the
Eastern
Front
,
but
resulted
in
the
Central
Powers
'
chief
offensive
effort
of
1915
,
causing
the
total
collapse
of
the
Russian
lines
and
their
retreat
far
into
Russia
.


The
continued
series
of
actions
lasted
the
majority
of
the
campaigning
season
for
1915
,
starting
in
early
May
and
only
ending
due
to
bad
weather
in
October
.


The
primary
cause
of
the
Central
Powers
victory
was
their
superior
artillery
firepower
.


German
heavy
field
guns
and
howitzers
with
their
high
angle
of
fire
suppressed
the
Russian
artillery
and
devastated
their
infantry
counterattacks
.


The
Germans
improved
the
accuracy
of
their
artillery
fire
through
aerial
observation
.


German
siege
mortars
reduced
Russian
fortresses
within
days
.


German
light
artillery
supported
the
infantry
through
direct
fire
,
devastating
Russian
strongpoints
.

It
was
conceived
as
a
follow-up
tour
for
Zombie

World

.


At
the
time
,
Marilyn
Manson
was
engaged
in
their
worldwide
Hey
Cruel
World
...
Tour
,
hence
,
Twins
of
Evil
became
a
'tour

a
tour
'
for
the
band
.


It
consisted
of
two
legs
covering
concert
dates
the
United
States
and
Europe
.


The
tour
made
headlines
within
the
rock
community
due
to
a
highly
publicized
altercation
between
the
bands
'
respective
lead
vocalists
.


Despite
this
,
both
frontmen
privately
made
amends
and
Twins

became
a
critically
and

successful
double

that
spawned

The
24th
G8
Summit
was
held
in
Birmingham
,
England
,
United
Kingdom
on
May
15–17
,
1998
.


The
venue
for
this
summit
meeting
was
the
International
Convention
Centre
,
Birmingham
.


The
Group
of
Seven
(
G7
)
was
an
unofficial
forum
which
brought
together
the
heads
of
the
richest
industrialized
countries
:
France
,
Germany
,
Italy
,
Japan
,
the
United
Kingdom
,
the
United
States
and
Canada
starting
in
1976
.


The
G8
,
meeting
for
the
first
time
in
1997
,
was
formed
with
the
addition
of
Russia
.


in
addition
,
the
president
of
the
european
commission
has
been
formally
included
in
summits
since
1981
.


The
summits
were
not
meant
to
be
linked
formally
with
wider
international
institutions
;
and
in
fact
,
a
mild
rebellion
against
the
stiff
formality
of
other
international
meetings
was
a
part
of
the
genesis
of
cooperation
between
France
's
President
Giscard
d'Estaing
and
Germany
's
Chancellor
Helmut
Schmidt
as
they
conceived
the
initial
summit
of
the
Group
of
Six
(
G6
)
in
1975
.


The
1872
North
Cascades
earthquake
occurred
at
in
central
Washington
state
.


A
maximum
Mercalli
intensity
of
VIII
(
``
Severe
''
)
was
assessed
for
several
locations
,
though
less
intense
shaking
was
observed
at
many
other
locations
in
Washington
,
Oregon
,
and
British
Columbia
.


Some
of
these
intermediate
outlying
areas
reported
V
(
``
Moderate
''
)
to
VII
(
``
Very
strong
''
)
shaking
,
but
intensities
as
high
as
IV
(
``
Light
''
)
were
reported
as
far
distant
as
Idaho
and
Montana
.


Due
to
the
remote
location
of
the
mainshock
and
a
series
of
strong
aftershocks
,
damage
to
man
made
structures
was
limited
to
a
few
cabins
close
to
the
areas
of
the
highest
intensity
.


Because
the
earthquake
occurred
before
seismometers
were
operating
in
the
region
,
the
magnitude
of
the
shock
and
its
location
were
never
precisely
determined
,
but
the
intensity
reports
that
are
available
for
the
event
were
studied
,
and
various
epicenters
for
the
event
were
proposed
based
on
these
limited
data
.


One
study
presented
an
estimated
of
6.5–7.0
,
with
a
proposed
location
on
the
east
side
of
the
Cascade
Range
near
Lake
Chelan
.


The
results
of
a
separate
study
indicated
that
it
may
have
been
a
larger
event
,
placing
the
shock
in
the
North
Cascades
,
just
south
of
the
Canada–United
States
border
at
Ross
Lake
.


Zaire
74
was
a
three-day
live
music
festival
that
took
place
on
September
22
to
24
,
1974
at
the
20th
of
May
Stadium
in
Kinshasa
,
Zaire
(
now
Democratic
Republic
of
the
Congo
)
.


The
concert
,
conceived
by
South
African
trumpeter
Hugh
Masekela
and
record
producer
Stewart
Levine
,
was
meant
to
be
a
major
promotional
event
for
the
heavyweight
boxing
championship
match
between
Muhammad
Ali
and
George
Foreman
,
known
as
The
Rumble
in
the
Jungle
.


When
an
injury
forced
Foreman
to
postpone
the
fight
by
six
weeks
,
the
festival
's
intended
audience
of
international
tourists
was
all
but
eliminated
and
Levine
had
to
decide
whether
or
not
to
cancel
the
event
.


The
decision
was
made
to
move
forward
,
and
80,000
people
attended
.


In
addition
to
promoting
the
Ali-Foreman
fight
,
the
Zaire
74
event
was
intended
to
present
and
promote
racial
and
cultural
solidarity
between
African
American
and
African
people
.


Thirty
one
performing
groups
,
17
from
Zaire
and
14
from
overseas
,
performed
.


Featured
performers
included
top
R

B
and
soul
artists
from
the
United
States
such
as
James
Brown
,
Bill
Withers
,
B.B
.


King

and
The
Spinners
as
well
as
prominent
African
performers
such
as
Miriam

The
Polish
coup
d'état
attempt
in
Lithuania
refers
to
a
failed
attempt
by
Polish
statesman
Józef
Piłsudski
to
overthrow
the
existing
Lithuanian
government
of
Prime
Minister
Mykolas
Sleževičius
,
and
install
a
pro-Polish
cabinet
that
would
agree
to
a
union
with
Poland
.


The
Polish
intelligence
agency
,
the
Polish
Military
Organization
(
PMO
)
was
to
carry
out
the
coup
d'etat
,
planned
to
be
implemented
in
August
1919
.


The
coup
was
designed
to
seem
to
be
an
initiative
by
local
Lithuanians
aiming
to
free
their
government
of
German
influence
.


The
PMO
hoped
to
rely
on
the
assistance
of
sympathetic
Lithuanian
activists
.


They
were
thwarted
by
the
lack
of
cooperation
and
the
unwillingness
of
sufficient
number
of
Lithuanians
to
support
the
Polish
cause
.


After
the
Sejny
Uprising
,
a
Polish
revolt
against
the
Lithuanian
authorities
in
one
of
the
disputed
border
regions
,
Lithuanian
intelligence
intensified
its
investigation
of
the
Polish
minority
and
sympathizers
in
Lithuania
,
and
uncovered
the
planned
coup
.


The
Lithuanians
,
not
knowing
the
membership
of
the
PMO
,
arrested
numerous
Polish
activists
and
destabilized
the
PMO
network
enough
to
prevent
the
coup
attempt
.


Later
the
full
membership
list
was
obtained
and
the
PMO
in
Lithuania
was
dissolved
.


The
coup
further
strained
Polish–Lithuanian
relations
.


iHeartRadio
Wango
Tango
or
commonly
referred
to
as
simply
Wango
Tango
is
an
annual
day-long
concert
produced
by
local
Los
Angeles
radio
station
KIIS-FM
.


The
concert
series
has
been
staged
at
various
venues
around
southern
California
including
Dodger

performers
in
a
day
long
series
of
sets
.


Often
,
noted
celebrities
are
on
hand
to
introduce

act
.


The
concert
concept
was
conceived
by
then
marketing

and
the
General
Manager
of
KIIS

at
the
time
,
Roy
Laughlin

The
naval
Incident
of
Pacocha
took
place
on
29
May
1877
when
Nicolás
de
Piérola
was
leading
a
revolution
to
overthrow
then
Peruvian
President
Mariano
Ignacio
Prado
.


Piérola
's
supporters
used
the
Peruvian
monitor
``
Huáscar
''
as
a
raiding
ship
.


She
harassed
the
shipping
especially
off
El
Callao
,
the
main
commercial
port
of
Peru
.


However
,
after
she
boarded
some
British
merchant
ships
,
British
authorities
sent
Rear
Admiral
de
Horsey
to
capture
the
vessel
.


The
Peruvian
warship
managed
to
outrun
the
British
squadron
after
a
fierce
exchange
of
fire
.


``
Huáscar
''
s
guns
were
undermanned
,
and
she
fired
just
40
rounds
.


``
Shah
''
s
mast
was
damaged
by
splinters
.


On
the
British
side
,
``
Shah
''
fired
237
shots
and
``
Amethyst
''
190
,
but
none
of
them
carried
armour-piercing
ammunition
.


``
Huáscar
''
was
hit
60
times
,
but
her
armour
shield
defeated
all
the
rounds
.


There
was
a
last-ditch
effort
to
stop
or
sink
the
rebels
when
two
small
torpedo
rams
from
``
Shah
''
attempted
to
find
the
``
Huáscar
''
,
but
the
Peruvian
ship
managed
to
escape
under
the
cover
of
darkness
.


The
rebel
crew
was
forced
to
surrender
their
ship
to
the
Peruvian
government
just
two
days
later
.


This
battle
saw
the
first
use
of
the
newly
invented
self-propelled
torpedo
which
,
at
the
time
,
had
just
entered
limited
service
with
the
Royal
Navy
.


The
torpedo
was
dodged
by
the
rebel
monitor
.


The
Columbine
High
School
massacre
was
a
school
shooting
and
attempted
bombing
that
occurred
on
April
20
,
1999
,
at
Columbine
High
School
in
Columbine
,
Colorado
,
United
States
.


The
perpetrators
,
twelfth
grade
(
senior
)
students
Eric
Harris
and
Dylan
Klebold
,
murdered
12
students
and
one
teacher
,
before
committing
suicide
.


Ten
students
were
killed
in
the
school
library
,
where
Harris
and
Klebold
would
commit
suicide
.


21
additional
people
were
injured
with
gunshots
and
gunfire
was
also
exchanged
with
the
police
.


Another
three
people
were
injured
trying
to
escape
the
school
.


At
the
time
,
it
was
the
deadliest
school
shooting
in
United
States
history
.


The
crime
has
inspired
several
copycats
,
had
an
impact
on
pop
culture
(
see
Columbine
effect
)
and
``
Columbine
''
has
become
a
byword
for
mass
shootings
.


In
addition
to
the
shootings
,
the
attack
involved
several
homemade
bombs
.


Two
of
these
were
placed
in
the
cafeteria
,
powerful
enough
to
kill
or
seriously
injure
all
people
within
the
area
,
although
they
failed
to
detonate
.


Their
cars
in
the
parking
lots
were
made
into
bombs
which
also
failed
to
detonate
,
and
at
another
location
away
from
the
school
,
two
bombs
were
set
up
as
diversions
,
only
one
of
which
partially
detonated
.


The
motive
remains
unclear
,
but
the
pair
planned
the
massacre
for
around
a
year
.


Harris
and
Klebold
also
wished
to
become
infamous
and
“
kickstart
a
revolution
,
”
as
Harris
said
in
a
home
video
.


They
hoped
the
massacre
would
exceed
the
carnage
at
the
Oklahoma
City
bombing
four
years
prior
;
furthermore
causing
the
most
deaths
in
United
States
history
.


``
USA
Today
''
referred
to
the
attack
as
``
planned
as
a
grand
,
if
badly
implemented
,
terrorist
bombing
''
.


The
police
were
slow
to
enter
the
school
and
were
heavily
criticized
for
not
intervening
during
the
shooting
.


The
incident
resulted
in
the
introduction
of
the
Immediate
Action
Rapid
Deployment
tactic
,
which
is
used
in
active
shooter
situations
.


Columbine
also
resulted
in
an
increased
emphasis
on
school
security
with
zero
tolerance
policies
.


Debates
were
sparked
over
gun
control
laws
and
gun
culture
,
high
school
cliques
,
subcultures
,
and
bullying
.


Also
discussed
were
the
moral
panic
over
goths
,
social
outcasts
,
the
use
of
pharmaceutical
antidepressants
by
teenagers
,
teenage
Internet
use
and
violence
in
video
games
and
movies
.


Many
impromptu
memorials
were
created
after
the
massacre
,
including
victims
Rachel
Scott
's
car
and
John
Tomlin
's
truck
.

for
the
victims
and
shooters
were
also
erected
on
top
of
a
hill
in
Clement
Park
.


The
crosses
for
Harris
and
Klebold
were
later
removed
as
it
caused
controversy
.


A
permanent
memorial
began
planning
in
June
1999
.


Designing
took
three
and
a
half
years
and
included
feedback
from
victims
'
families
,
survivors
,
the
high
school
's
students
and
staff
,
and
the
community
.


A
groundbreaking
of
the
permanent
memorial
occurred
in
June
2006
.


The
Columbine
Memorial
opened
up
to
the
public
on
September
21
,

.


The
Yugoslav
coup
d'état
of
27
March
1941
in
Belgrade
,
Kingdom
of
Yugoslavia
,
replaced
the
regency
led
by
Prince
Paul
and
installed
King
Peter
II
.


it
was
planned
and
conducted
by
a
group
of
pro-western
unk
royal
yugoslav
army
air
force
officers
formally
led
by
its
commander
,
general
UNK
UNK
,
who
had
been
associated
with
several
putsch
plots
from
1938
onwards
.


Brigadier
General
of
Military
Aviation
Borivoje
Mirković
,
Major
Živan
Knežević
of
the
Yugoslav
Royal
Guards
,
and
his
brother
Radoje
Knežević
were
key
organisers
in
the
overthrow
of
the
government
.


In
addition
to
Radoje
Knežević
,
some
other
civilian
leaders
were
probably
aware
of
the
takeover
before
it
was
launched
and
moved
to
support
it
once
it
occurred
,
but
they
were
not
among
the
organisers
.


the
communist
party
of
yugoslavia
played
no
part
in
the
coup
,
although
it
made
a
significant
contribution
to
the
mass
street
protests
in
many
cities
that
signalled
popular
support
for
it
once
it
had
occurred
.


The
putsch
was
successful
and
deposed
the
three-member
regency
:
Prince
Paul
,
Radenko
Stanković
and
Ivo
Perović
,
as
well
as
the
government
of
Prime
Minister
Dragiša
Cvetković
.


Two
days
prior
to
its
ousting
,
the
Cvetković
government
had
signed
the
Vienna
Protocol
on
the
Accession
of
Yugoslavia
to
the
Tripartite
Pact
(
Axis
)
.


The
coup
had
been
planned
for
several
months
,
but
the
signing
of
the
Tripartite
Pact
spurred
the
organisers
to
carry
it
out
,
encouraged
by
the
British
Special
Operations
Executive
.


The
military
conspirators
brought
to
power
the
17-year-old
King
Peter
II
,
whom
they
declared
to
be
of
age
to
assume
the
throne
,
and
a
weak
and
divided
government
of
national
unity
was
formed
with
Simović
as
prime
minister
and
Vladko
Maček
and
Slobodan
Jovanović
as
his
vice-premiers
.


The
coup
led
directly
to
the
German-led
Axis
invasion
of
Yugoslavia
.


The
importance
of
the
putsch
and
subsequent
invasion
in
delaying
Operation
Barbarossa
,
the
Axis
invasion
of
the
Soviet
Union
,
is
disputed
but
most
scholars
now
consider
that
it
had
no
significant
impact
on
the
eventual
outcome
of
that
campaign
.


Operation
Market
Garden
was
a
failed
World
War
II
military
operation
fought
in
the
Netherlands
from
17
to
25
September
1944
.


It
was
the
brainchild
of
Field
Marshal
Sir
Bernard
Law
Montgomery
,
planned
primarily
by
Generals
Brereton
and
Williams
of
the
USAAF
.


The
airborne
part
of
the
operation
was
undertaken
by
the
First
Allied
Airborne
Army
with
the
land
operation
by
XXX
Corps
of
the
British
Second
Army
.


The
objective
was
to
create
a
salient
into
German
territory
with
a
bridgehead
over
the
River
Rhine
,
creating
an
Allied
invasion
route
into
northern
Germany
.


This
was
to
be
achieved
by
seizing
a
series
of
nine
bridges
by
Airborne
forces
with
land
forces
swiftly
following
moving
over
the
bridges
.


The
operation
succeeded
in
liberating
the
Dutch
cities
of
Eindhoven
and
Nijmegen
along
with
many
towns
,
creating
a
salient
into
German-held
territory
limiting
V-2
rocket
launching
sites
.


It
failed
,
however
,
to
secure
a
bridgehead
over
the
Rhine
,
halting
at
the
river
.


Market
Garden
consisted
of
two
sub
operations
:
The
attack
was
the
largest
airborne
operation
up
to
that
point
in
World
War
II
.


Supreme
Commander
General
Eisenhower
's
strategic
goal
was
to
encircle
the
heart
of
German
industry
,
the
Ruhr
Area
,
in
a
pincer
movement
.


The
northern
end
of
the
pincer
would
circumvent
the
northern
end
of
the
Siegfried
Line
,
giving
easier
access
into
Germany
across
the
north
German
plains
enabling
mobile
warfare
.


The
prime
aim
of
Operation
Market
Garden
was
to
establish
the
northern
end
of
a
pincer
ready
to
project
deeper
into
Germany
.


Allied
forces
would
project
north
from
Belgium
,
through
the
Netherlands
,
across
the
Rhine
and
consolidate
north
of
Arnhem
on
the
Dutch/German
border
,
ready
to
close
the
pincer
.


The
operation
made
massive
use
of
airborne
forces
,
whose
tactical
objectives
were
to
secure
the
bridges
and
to
allow
a
rapid
advance
by
armored
ground
units
to
consolidate
north
of
Arnhem
.


The
operation
required
the
seizure
of
the
bridges
by
airborne
troops
across
the
Meuse
River
,
two
arms
of
the
Rhine
(
the
Waal
River
and
the
Lower
Rhine
)
,
together
with
crossings
over
several
smaller
canals
and
tributaries
.


However
,
this
large
airborne
force
contrasted
with
the
ground
forces
being
light
with
only
one
corps
moving
north
of
Eindhoven
,
XXX
Corps
.


XXX
Corps
took
along
5,000
vehicles
full
of
bridging
equipment
and
9,000
sappers
.


The
Allies
captured
several
bridges
between
Eindhoven
and
Nijmegen
at
the
beginning
of
the
operation
.


Lieutenant-General
Brian
Horrocks
'
XXX
Corps
ground
force
advance
was
delayed
by
the
initial
failure
of
the
airborne
units
to
secure
bridges
at
Son
en
Breugel
and
Nijmegen
.


German
forces
demolished
the
bridge
over
the
Wilhelmina
Canal
at
Son
before
it
could
be
captured
by
the
US
101st
Airborne
Division
,
although
a
Bailey
bridge
was
then
built
over
the
canal
by
British
sappers
.


This
delayed
XXX
Corps
'
advance
by
12
hours
,
however
they
made
up
the
time
,
reaching
Nijmegen
on
schedule
.


The
US
82nd
Airborne
Division
's
failure
to
capture
the
main
highway
bridge
over
the
Waal
River
at
Nijmegen
before
20
September
delayed
the
advance
by
36
hours
.


XXX
Corps
had
to
seize
the
bridge
themselves
instead
of
speeding
over
a
captured
bridge
onwards
to
Arnhem
,
where
the
British
paratroopers
were
still
holding
the
north
end
of
the
bridge
.


at
the
northern
point
of
the
airborne
operation
,
the
british
1st
airborne
division
initially
encountered
strong
resistance
.


The
delays
in
capturing
the
bridge
at
Nijmegen
and
constructing
a
Bailey
bridge
at
Son
gave
time
for
German
forces
(
the
9th
SS
Panzer
Division
``
Hohenstaufen
''
and
10th
SS
Panzer
Division
``
Frundsberg
''
,
which
were
in
the
Arnhem
area
at
the
start
of
the
jump
)
to
organise
their
counterattack
.


A
small
British
force
managed
to
capture
the
north
end
of
the
Arnhem
road
bridge
,
denying
use
of
the
intact
bridge
to
German
forces
.


After
the
ground
forces
failed
to
relieve
the
paratroopers
on
time
,
they
were
overrun
on
21
September
.


at
the
same
time
that
xxx
corps
'
tanks
moved
over
the
nijmegen
bridge
,
36
hours
late
,
after
seizing
it
from
the
germans
,
the
british
paratroopers
at
the
arnhem
bridge
were
capitulating
,
unable
to
hold
on
any
longer
.


The
remainder
of
the
British
1st
Airborne
Division
was
trapped
in
a
small
pocket
west
of
the
Arnhem
bridge
,
which
was
evacuated
on
25
September
after
sustaining
heavy
casualties
.


The
Allies
had
failed
to
cross
the
Rhine
.


The
river
remained
a
barrier
to
their
advance
into
Germany
until
offensives
at
Remagen
,
Oppenheim
,
Rees
and
Wesel
in
March
1945
.


The
failure
of
Operation
Market
Garden
to
form
a
foothold
over
the
Rhine
ended
Allied
hopes
of
finishing
the
war
by
Christmas
1944
.


The
Battle
of
the
Atlantic
was
the
longest
continuous
military
campaign
in
World
War
II
,
running
from
1939
to
the
defeat
of
Nazi
Germany
in
1945
,
and
was
a
major
part
of
the
Naval
history
of
World
War
II
.


At
its
core
was
the
Allied
naval
blockade
of
Germany
,
announced
the
day
after
the
declaration
of
war
,
and
Germany
's
subsequent
counter-blockade
.


It
was
at
its
height
from
mid-1940
through
to
the
end
of
1943
.


the
battle
of
the
atlantic
pitted
u-boats
and
other
warships
of
the
``
kriegsmarine
''
(
navy
)
and
aircraft
of
the
``
luftwaffe
''
(
air
force
)
against
the
royal
canadian
navy
,
royal
navy
,
united
states
navy
,
and
allied
merchant
shipping
.


Convoys
,
coming
mainly
from
North
America
and
predominantly
going
to
the
United
Kingdom
and
the
Soviet
Union
,
were
protected
for
the
most
part
by
the
British
and
Canadian
navies
and
air
forces
.


These
forces
were
aided
by
ships
and
aircraft
of
the
United
States
beginning
September
13
,
1941
.


The
Germans
were
joined
by
submarines
of
the
Italian
Royal
Navy
(
``
Regia
Marina
''
)
after
their
Axis
ally
Italy
entered
the
war
on
June
10
,
1940
.


As
an
island
nation
,
the
United
Kingdom
was
highly
dependent
on
imported
goods
.


Britain
required
more
than
a
million
tons
of
imported
material
per
week
in
order
to
be
able
to
survive
and
fight
.


In
essence
,
the
Battle
of
the
Atlantic
was
a
tonnage
war
:
the
Allied
struggle
to
supply
Britain
and
the
Axis
attempt
to
stem
the
flow
of
merchant
shipping
that
enabled
Britain
to
keep
fighting
.


From
1942
onward
,
the
Axis
also
sought
to
prevent
the
build-up
of
Allied
supplies
and
equipment
in
the
British
Isles
in
preparation
for
the
invasion
of
occupied
Europe
.


The
defeat
of
the
U-boat
threat
was
a
prerequisite
for
pushing
back
the
Axis
.


The
outcome
of
the
battle
was
a
strategic
victory
for
the
Allies—the
German
blockade
failed—but
at
great
cost
:
3,500
merchant
ships
and
175
warships
were
sunk
in
the
Atlantic
for
the
loss
of
783
U-boats
(
the
majority
being
Type
VII
submarines
)
and
47
German
surface
warships
,
including
4
battleships
(
``
Scharnhorst
''
,
``
Bismarck
''
,
``
Gneisenau
''
,
and
``
Tirpitz
''
)
,
9
cruisers
,
7
raiders
,
and
27
destroyers
.


Of
the
U-boats
,
519
were
sunk
by
British
,
Canadian
,
or
other
allied
forces
,
while
175
were
destroyed
by
American
forces
;
15
were
destroyed
by
Soviets
and
73
were
scuttled
by
their
crews
before
the
end
of
the
war
for
various
causes
.


The
Battle
of
the
Atlantic
has
been
called
the
``
longest
,
largest
,
and
most
complex
''
naval
battle
in
history
.


The
campaign
started
immediately
after
the
European
War
began
,
during
the
so-called
``
Phoney
War
''
,
and
lasted
six
years
,
until
the
German
Surrender
in
May
1945
.


It
involved
thousands
of
ships
in
more
than
100
convoy
battles
and
perhaps
1,000
single-ship
encounters
,
in
a
theatre
covering
millions
of
square
miles
of
ocean
.


The
situation
changed
constantly
,
with
one
side
or
the
other
gaining
advantage
,
as
participating
countries
surrendered
,
joined
and
even
changed
sides
in
the
war
,
and
as
new
weapons
,
tactics
,
counter-measures
and
equipment
were
developed
by
both
sides
.


The
Allies
gradually
gained
the
upper
hand
,
overcoming
German
surface
raiders
by
the
end
of
1942
and
defeating
the
U-boats
by
mid-1943
,
though
losses
due
to
U-boats
continued
until
the
war
's
end
.


The
British
2nd
Parachute
Brigade
was
part
of
the
Operation
Rugby
airborne
landings
in
August
1944
.


the
operation
was
carried
out
by
an
ad
hoc
airborne
formation
called
the
1st
airborne
task
force
.


Operation
Rugby
was
itself
part
of
the
Operation
Dragoon
invasion
of
Southern
France
by
the
American
7th
Army
.


The
airborne
task
force
landed
in
the
River
Argens
valley
with
the
objective
of
preventing
German
reinforcements
from
reaching
the
landing
beaches
.


The
landings
were
mainly
an
American
operation
and
the
brigade
was
the
only
British
Army
formation
involved
.


The
brigade
's
pathfinders
landed
accurately
and
set
up
their
homing
beacons
,
but
the
main
body
of
the
brigade
landed
over
a
large
area
,
some
away
.


The
following
glider
force
also
had
problems
;
weather
conditions
forced
the
brigade
's
anti-tank
unit
to
turn
back
for
Italy
and
return
with
the
second
wave
later
that
day
.


Eventually
the
brigade
captured
their
primary
objectives
,
but
the
lack
of
manpower
meant
that
their
secondary
objective
of
Le
Muy
was
given
to
the
American
airborne
forces
.


The
seaborne
and
airborne
landings
linked
up
within
two
days
,
and
the
brigade
became
the
reserve
formation
for
the
operation
.


As
a
British
withdrawal
from
France
at
the
earliest
opportunity
had
been
the
original
intent
,
the
brigade
boarded
ships
bound
for
Italy
eleven
days
after
landing
.


The
operation
had
cost
the
brigade
362
casualties
,
but
this
did
not
hinder
their
next
mission
in
Greece
two
months
later
.


Only
126
replacements
were
required
to
bring
the
brigade
back
up
to
full
strength
.


The
Invasion
of
Algiers
in
1830
was
a
large-scale
military
operation
by
which
the
Kingdom
of
France
,
ruled
by
Charles
X
,
invaded
and
conquered
the
Ottoman
Regency
of
Algiers
.


Algiers
had
been
a
province
of
the
Ottoman
Empire
since
the
Capture
of
Algiers
in
1529
by
Hayreddin
Barbarossa
.


A
diplomatic
incident
in
1827
,
the
so-called
Fan
Affair
(
Fly
Whisk
Incident
)
served
as
a
pretext
to
initiate
a
blockade
against
the
port
of
Algiers
.


After
three
years
of
standstill
and
a
more
severe
incident
in
which
a
French
ship
carrying
an
ambassador
to
the
dey
with
a
proposal
for
negotiations
was
bombarded
,
the
French
determined
that
more
forceful
action
was
required
.


charles
x
was
also
in
need
of
diverting
attention
from
turbulent
french
domestic
affairs
that
culminated
with
his
deposition
during
the
later
stages
of
the
invasion
in
the
july
revolution
.


The
invasion
of
Algiers
began
on
5
July
1830
with
a
naval
bombardment
by
a
fleet
under
Admiral
Duperré
,
and
a
landing
by
troops
under
Louis
Auguste
Victor
de
Ghaisne
,
comte
de
Bourmont
.


The
French
quickly
defeated
the
troops
of
Hussein
Dey
,
the
Ottoman
ruler
,
but
native
resistance
was
widespread
.


This
resulted
in
a
protracted
military
campaign
,
lasting
more
than
45
years
,
to
root
out
popular
opposition
to
the
colonisation
.


The
so-called
``
pacification
''
was
marked
by
resistance
of
figures
such
as
Ahmed
Bey
,
Abd
El-Kader
and
Lalla
Fatma
N'Soumer
.


The
invasion
marked
the
end
of
several
centuries
of
Ottoman
rule
in
Algeria
and
the
beginning
of
French
Algeria
.


In
1848
,
the
territories
conquered
around
Algiers
were
organised
into
three
départements
,
defining
the
territories
of
modern
Algeria
.


Cyclone
Tracy
was
a
tropical
cyclone
that
devastated
the
city
of
Darwin
,
Northern
Territory
,
Australia
from
24
to
26
December
1974
.


the
storm
was
the
second-smallest
tropical
cyclone
on
record
(
in
terms
of
gale-force
wind
diameter
)
,
behind
only
tropical
storm
marco
in
2008
.


The
small
,
developing
easterly
storm
had
been
observed
passing
clear
of
the
city
initially
,
but
then
turned
towards
it
early
on

December
.


After
10:00

ACST
,
damage
became
severe
,
and

did
not
immediately
acknowledge
the
emergency
,
partly
because
they
had
been
alerted
to
an
earlier
cyclone
(
Selma
)
that
passed
west
of
the
city
.


Additionally
,
news
outlets
had
only
a
skeleton
crew
on
duty
over
the
holiday
.


Tracy
killed
71
people
,
caused
837
million
in
damage
(
1974
dollars
)
,
or
approximately
6.85
billion
(
2018
dollars
)
,
or
$
4.79

USD
.


It
destroyed
more
than
70
percent
of
Darwin
's
buildings
,
including
80
percent
of
houses
.


It
left
more
than
25,000
out
of
the
47,000
inhabitants
of
the
city
homeless
prior
to
landfall
and
required
the
evacuation
of
over
30,000
people
,
of
whom
many
never
returned
.


After
the
storm
passed
,
the
city
was
rebuilt
using
more
stringent
standards
``

''
.


the
first
libyan
civil
war
,
also
referred
to
as
the
libyan
revolution
or
17
february
revolution
,
was
an
armed
conflict
in
2011
in
the
north
african
country
of
libya
fought
between
forces
loyal
to
colonel
muammar
gaddafi
and
those
seeking
to
oust
his
government
.


The
war
was
preceded
by
protests
in
Zawiya
on
8
August
2009
and
finally
ignited
by
protests
in
Benghazi
beginning
on
Tuesday
,
15
February
2011
,
which
led
to
clashes
with
security
forces
that
fired
on
the
crowd
.


The
protests
escalated
into
a
rebellion
that
spread
across
the
country
,
with
the
forces
opposing
Gaddafi
establishing
an
interim
governing
body
,
the
National
Transitional
Council
.


The
United
Nations
Security
Council
passed
an
initial
resolution
on
26
February
,
freezing
the
assets
of
Gaddafi
and
his
inner
circle
and
restricting
their
travel
,
and
referred
the
matter
to
the
International
Criminal
Court
for
investigation
.


In
early
March
,
Gaddafi
's
forces
rallied
,
pushed
eastwards
and
re-took
several
coastal
cities
before
reaching
Benghazi
.


A
further
UN
resolution
authorised
member
states
to
establish
and
enforce
a
no-fly
zone
over
Libya
,
and
to
use
``
all
necessary
measures
''
to
prevent
attacks
on
civilians
,
which
turned
into
a
bombing
campaign
by
the
forces
of
NATO
against
military
installations
and
civilian
infrastructure
of
Libya
.


The
Gaddafi
government
then
announced
a
ceasefire
,
but
fighting
and
bombing
continued
.


Throughout
the
conflict
,
rebels
rejected
government
offers
of
a
ceasefire
and
efforts
by
the
African
Union
to
end
the
fighting
because
the
plans
set
forth
did
not
include
the
removal
of
Gaddafi
.


In
August
,
rebel
forces
launched
an
offensive
on
the
government-held
coast
of
Libya
,
backed
by
a
wide-reaching
NATO
bombing
campaign
,
taking
back
territory
lost
months
before
and
ultimately
capturing
the
capital
city
of
Tripoli
,
while
Gaddafi
evaded
capture
and
loyalists
engaged
in
a
rearguard
campaign
.


On
16
September
2011
,
the
National
Transitional
Council
was
recognised
by
the
United
Nations
as
the
legal
representative
of
Libya
,
replacing
the
Gaddafi
government
.


Muammar
Gaddafi
evaded
capture
until
20
October
2011
,
when
he
was
captured
and
killed
in
Sirte
.


The
National
Transitional
Council
``
declared
the
liberation
of
Libya
''
and
the
official
end
of
the
war
on
23
October
2011
.


In
the
aftermath
of
the
civil
war
,
a
low-level
insurgency
by
former
Gaddafi
loyalists
continued
.


There
have
been
various
disagreements
and
strife
between
local
militia
and
tribes
,
including
fighting
on
23
January
2012
in
the
former
Gaddafi
stronghold
of
Bani
Walid
,
leading
to
an
alternative
town
council
being
established
and
later
recognized
by
the
National
Transitional
Council
(
NTC
)
.


A
much
greater
issue
has
been
the
role
of
militias
which
fought
in
the
civil
war
and
their
role
in
the
new
Libya
.


Some
have
refused
to
disarm
,
and
cooperation
with
the
NTC
has
been
strained
,
leading
to
demonstrations
against
militias
and
government
action
to
disband
such
groups
or
integrate
them
into
the
Libyan
military
.


These
unresolved
issues
led
directly
to
a
second
civil
war
in
Libya
.


The
2010
Shanghai
fire
was
a
fire
on
15
November
2010
that
destroyed
a
28-story
high-rise
apartment
building
in
the
city
of
Shanghai
,
China
,
killing
at
least
58
people
and
injuring
more
than
70
others
(
with
at
least
one
source
reporting
more
than
120
others
injured
)
.


An
investigation
under
the
PRC
State
Council
was
announced
on
16
November
,
the
day
after
the
fire
,
to
determine
the
cause
of
the
blaze
.


A
preliminary
finding
by
investigators
concluded
that
sparks
from
welding
work
being
done
on
the
building
,
undertaken
by
unlicensed
welders
,
ignited
scaffolding
around
the
structure
,
which
led
to
the
apartments
'
destruction
.


The
municipal
government
also
placed
the
blame
on
illegal
multi-layered
subcontracting
,
and
detained
four
managers
from
several
construction
companies
.


In
all
,
sixteen
individuals
have
been
arrested
in
connection
to
the
fire
,
as
well
as
four
others
accused
of
being
unlicensed
welders
.


The
week
after
the
fire
,
city
officials
announced
a
compensation
plan
for
victims
of
the
fire
and
their
families
.


The
fire
also
prompted
the
government
to
pass
stricter
regulations
on
the
construction
industry
,
as
well
as
increased
fire
safety
inspections
.


Some
citizens
have
criticized
the
government
,
accusing
it
of
censoring
the
media
and
providing
an
inadequate
response
to
the
fire
.


The
Japanese
decided
to
withdraw
and
concede
Guadalcanal
to
Allied
forces
for
several
reasons
.


All
attempts
by
the
IJA
to
recapture
Henderson
Field
,
the
airfield
on
Guadalcanal
in
use
by
Allied
aircraft
,
had
been
repulsed
with
heavy
losses
.


Japanese
ground
forces
on
the
island
had
been
reduced
from
36,000
to
11,000
through
starvation
,
disease
,
and
battle
casualties
.


IJN
forces
were
also
suffering
heavy
losses
attempting
to
reinforce
and
resupply
the
ground
forces
on
the
island
.


These
losses
,
plus
the
projected
resources
needed
for
further
attempts
to
recapture
Guadalcanal
,
were
affecting
strategic
security
and
operations
in
other
areas
of
the
Japanese
Empire
.


The
decision
to
withdraw
was
endorsed
by
Emperor
Hirohito
on
31
December
1942
.


The
operation
began
on
14
January
1943
with
the
delivery
of
a
battalion
of
infantry
troops
to
Guadalcanal
to
act
as
rearguard
for
the
evacuation
.


Around
the
same
time
,
IJA
and
IJN
air
forces
began
an
air
superiority
campaign
around
the
Solomon
Islands
and
New
Guinea
.


During
the
air
campaign
,
a
US
cruiser
was
sunk
in
the
Battle
of
Rennell
Island
.


Two
days
later
,
Japanese
aircraft
sank
a
US
destroyer
near
Guadalcanal
.


The
withdrawal
was
carried
out
on
the
nights
of
1
,
4
,
and
7
February
by
destroyers
.


at
a
cost
of
one
destroyer
sunk
and
three
damaged
,
the
japanese
evacuated
unk
men
from
guadalcanal
.


During
the
evacuation
600
died
and
3,000
more
required
extensive
hospital
care
.


On
9
February
,
Allied
forces
realized
that
the
Japanese
were
gone
and
declared
Guadalcanal
secure
,
ending
the
six-month
campaign
for
control
of
the
island
.


The
Staplehurst
rail
crash
was
a
derailment
at
Staplehurst
,
Kent
on
9
June
1865
at
3:13
pm
.


The
South
Eastern
Railway
Folkestone
to
London
boat
train
derailed
while
crossing
a
viaduct
where
a
length
of
track
had
been
removed
during
engineering
works
,
killing
ten
passengers
and
injuring
forty
.


In
the
Board
of
Trade
report
it
was
found
that
a
man
had
been
placed
with
a
red
flag
away
but
the
regulations
required
him
to
be
away
and
the
train
had
insufficient
time
to
stop
.


Charles
Dickens
was
travelling
with
Ellen
Ternan
and
her
mother
on
the
train
;
they
all
survived
the
derailment
.


He
tended
the
victims
,
some
of
whom
died
while
he
was
with
them
.


The
experience
affected
Dickens
greatly
;
he
lost
his
voice
for
two
weeks
and
afterwards
was
nervous
when
travelling
by
train
,
using
alternative
means
when
available
.


Dickens
died
five
years
to
the
day
after
the
accident
;
his
son
said
that
he
had
never
fully
recovered
.


The
Williamite
War
in
Ireland
(
1688–1691
)
(
,
``
war
of
the
two
kings
''
)
,
was
a
conflict
between
Jacobite
supporters
of
King
James
II
and
Williamite
supporters
of
Prince
William
of
Orange
.


It
is
also
called
the
Jacobite
War
in
Ireland
or
the
Williamite–Jacobite
War
in
Ireland
.


the
proximate
cause
of
the
war
was
the
glorious
revolution
of
1688
,
in
which
james
,
a
catholic
,
was
overthrown
as
king
of
the
three
kingdoms
of
england
,
ireland
and
scotland
and
replaced
by
his
protestant
daughter
mary
and
nephew
and
son-in-law
william
,
ruling
as
joint
monarchs
.


James
's
supporters
initially
retained
control
of
Ireland
,
which
he
hoped
to
use
as
a
base
for
a
campaign
to
reclaim
all
three
kingdoms
;
however
,
the
conflict
in
Ireland
also
involved
longstanding
domestic
issues
of
land
ownership
and
religious
and
civic
rights
,
and
many
Irish
Catholics
supported
James
in
the
hope
he
would
address
their
grievances
.


A
small
number
of
English
and
Scottish
Catholics
,
and
Protestants
of
the
established
Church
in
Ireland
,
also
fought
on
the
Jacobite
side
,
while
many
Irish
Protestants
supported
or
actively
fought
for
William
’
s
regime
.


While
the
war
's
Irish
name
emphasises
its
aspect
as
a
domestic
conflict
between
James
and
William
,
some
contemporaries
and
many
modern
commentators
have
viewed
it
as
part
of
a
wider
European
conflict
known
as
the
Nine
Years
'
War
or
War
of
the
Grand
Alliance
in
which
William
,
as
Stadtholder
of
the
Dutch
Republic
,
led
a
multi-national
coalition
against
France
under
Louis
XIV
.


William
’
s
deposition
of
James
was
partly
driven
by
his
need
to
control
and
mobilise
English
military
and
commercial
power
,
while
Louis
provided
limited
material
support
to
the
Jacobites
:
both
sides
were
aware
of
the
Irish
war
's
potential
to
divert
military
resources
from
the
Continent
.


The
war
began
with
a
series
of
skirmishes
between
James
’
s
Irish
Army
,
which
had
stayed
loyal
in
1688
,
and
militia
forces
raised
by
Irish
Protestants
:
they
culminated
in
the
Siege
of
Derry
,
where
the
Jacobites
failed
to
regain
control
of
one
of
the
north
’
s
key
towns
.


William
landed
a
force
including
English
,
Scottish
,
Dutch
,
Danish
and
other
troops
to
put
down
Jacobite
resistance
.


james
left
ireland
after
a
reverse
at
the
battle
of
the
boyne
in
1690
,
as
did
william
after
a
successful
jacobite
defence
of
limerick
;
the
remaining
jacobite
forces
were
decisively
defeated
at
the
battle
of
aughrim
in
1691
,
and
negotiated
terms
in
the
treaty
of
limerick
.


A
contemporary
witness
,
George
Story
,
calculated
that
the
war
had
claimed
100,000
lives
through
sickness
,
famine
,
and
in
battle
.


Subsequent
Jacobite
risings
were
confined
to
Scotland
and
England
,
but
the
war
was
to
have
a
lasting
effect
on
the
political
and
cultural
landscape
of
Ireland
,
confirming
British
and
Protestant
rule
over
the
country
for
over
two
centuries
.


while
the
treaty
of
limerick
had
offered
a
series
of
guarantees
to
catholics
,
subsequent
extension
of
the
penal
laws
,
particularly
during
the
war
of
the
spanish
succession
,
would
further
erode
their
civic
rights
.


The
Williamite
victories
at
Derry
and
the
Boyne
are
still
celebrated
by
some
,
mostly
Ulster
Protestant
,
unionists
in
Ireland
today
.


The
Rif
War
was
an
armed
conflict
fought
from
1920
to
1927
between
the
colonial
power
Spain
(
later
joined
by
France
)
and
the
Berber
tribes
of
the
Rif
mountainous
region
of
Morocco
.


Led
by
Abd
el-Krim
,
the
Riffians
at
first
inflicted
several
defeats
on
the
Spanish
forces
by
using
guerrilla
tactics
and
captured
European
weapons
.


After
France
's
military
intervention
against
Abd
el-Krim
's
forces
and
the
major
landing
of
Spanish
troops
at
Al
Hoceima
,
considered
the
first
amphibious
landing
in
history
to
involve
the
use
of
tanks
and
aircraft
,
Abd
el-Krim
surrendered
to
the
French
and
was
taken
into
exile
.


In
1909
,
Rifian
tribes
aggressively
confronted
Spanish
workers
of
the
iron
mines
of
the
Rif
,
near
Melilla
,
which
led
to
the
intervention
of
the
Spanish
Army
.


The
military
operations
in
Jebala
,
in
the
Moroccan
West
,
began
in
1911
with
the
Larache
Landing
.


Spain
worked
to
pacify
a
large
part
of
the
most
violent
areas
until
1914
,
a
slow
process
of
consolidation
of
frontiers
that
lasted
until
1919
due
to
World
War
I
.


the
following
year
,
after
the
signing
of
the
treaty
of
fez
,
the
northern
moroccan
area
was
adjudicated
to
spain
as
a
protectorate
.


The
Riffian
populations
strongly
resisted
the
Spanish
,
unleashing
a
conflict
that
would
last
for
several
years
.


In
1921
,
the
Spanish
troops
suffered
the
catastrophic
Disaster
of
Annual
in
addition
to
a
rebellion
led
by
Rifian
leader
Abd
el-Krim
.


As
a
result
,
the
Spanish
retreated
to
a
few
fortified
positions
while
Abd
el-Krim
ultimately
created
an
entire
independent
state
:
the
Republic
of
the
Rif
.


The
development
of
the
conflict
and
its
end
coincided
with
the
dictatorship
of
Primo
de
Rivera
,
who
took
on
command
of
the
campaign
from
1924
to
1927
.


In
addition
,
and
after
the
Battle
of
Uarga
in
1925
,
the
French
intervened
in
the
conflict
and
established
a
joint
collaboration
with
Spain
that
culminated
in
the
Alhucemas
landing
which
proved
a
turning
point
.


By
1926
the
area
had
been
pacified
;
Abd-el-Krim
surrendered
in
July
1927
;
and
the
Spanish
regained
the
previously
lost
territory
.


The
Rif
War
is
still
considered
controversial
among
historians
.


Some
see
in
it
a
harbinger
of
the
decolonization
process
in
North
Africa
.


Others
consider
it
one
of
the
last
colonial
wars
,
as
it
was
the
decision
of
the
Spanish
to
conquer
the
Rif
—
nominally
part
of
their
Moroccan
protectorate
but
``
de
facto
''
independent
—
that
catalyzed
the
entry
of
France
in
1924
.


The
Rif
War
left
a
deep
memory
both
in
Spain
and
in
Morocco
.


The
Riffian
insurgency
of
the
1920s
can
be
interpreted
as
a
precursor
to
the
Algerian
war
of
independence
,
which
took
place
three
decades
later
.


The
2012
Malian
coup
d'état
began
on
21
March
that
year
,
when
mutinying
Malian
soldiers
,
displeased
with
the
management
of
the
Tuareg
rebellion
,
attacked
several
locations
in
the
capital
Bamako
,
including
the
presidential
palace
,
state
television
,
and
military
barracks
.


The
soldiers
,
who
said
they
had
formed
the
National
Committee
for
the
Restoration
of
Democracy
and
State
,
declared
the
following
day
that
they
had
overthrown
the
government
of
Amadou
Toumani
Touré
,
forcing
him
into
hiding
.


The
coup
was
followed
by
``
unanimous
''
international
condemnation
,
harsh
sanctions
by
Mali
's
neighbors
,
and
the
swift
loss
of
northern
Mali
to
Tuareg
forces
,
leading
Reuters
to
describe
the
coup
as
``
a
spectacular
own-goal
''
.


On
6
April
,
the
junta
agreed
with
Economic
Community
of
West
African
States
(
ECOWAS
)
negotiators
that
they
would
step
down
from
power
in
return
for
the
end
of
sanctions
,
giving
power
to
a
transitional
government
led

In
the
following
days
,
both
Touré
and
coup
leader
Amadou
Sanogo
formally
resigned
;
however
,
as
of
16
May
,
the
junta
was
still
``
widely
thought
to
have
maintained
overall
control
''
.


On
3
December
2013
,
a
mass
grave
was
discovered
in
Diago
holding
the
remains
of

The
Alexisonfire
Farewell
Tour
was
a
concert
tour
by
Canadian
post-hardcore
band
Alexisonfire
,
taking
place
in
December
2012
.


After
their
tour
in
2010
,
band
member
Dallas
Green
expressed
his
desire
to
leave
the
band
.


The
band
officially
announced
their
break-up
in
August
2011
and
also
announced
plans
of
doing
one
last
farewell
tour
before
officially
disbanding
.


The
farewell
tour
was
officially
announced
on
August
9
,
2012
,
when
the
band
revealed
the
tour
dates
to
take
place
in
December
2012
.


The
band
commented
that
the
tour
was
short
due
to
December
being
the
only
available
time
window
for
all
five
members
when
they
were
free
from
any
other
commitments
,
especially
Dallas
Green
who
was
touring
with
City
and
Colour
and
Wade
MacNeil
who
was
touring
with
Gallows
.


On
August
17
,
2012
,
after
the
tickets
for
the
London
date
were
sold
out
in
just
5
minutes
,
the
band
announced
that
they
added
another
London
date
at
the
same
venue
,
a
day
before
,
on
December
2
,
2012
.


the
1975
album
``
born
to
run
''
was
bruce
springsteen
's
last
,
best
hope
for
fortune
and
fame
.


As
such
it
became
a
torturous
recording
process
,
and
to
make
ends
meet
Springsteen
and
the
E
Street
Band
toured
constantly
during
the
first
set
of
recording
sessions
for
it
,
performing
his
new
songs
as
he
developed
them
.


Before
,
during
,
and
immediately
after
the
album
's
commercially
successful
release
,
he
toured
again
,
sometimes
in
battle
against
his
now
highly
promoted
image
.


Financial
success
was
short-lived
,
however
,
as
he
was
soon
plunged
into
legal
battles
with
his
former
manager
and
enjoined
from
further
recording
.


Again
he
toured
to
make
a
living
,
long
after
the
conventional
period
of
playing
in
connection
with
an
album
's
release
was
over
;
only
when
his
legal
issues
were
finally
resolved
did
he
stop
.


from
1974
through
1977
,
these
outings
are
collectively
the
born
to
run
tours
.


Battle
of
Ciołków
(
the
village
is
now
called
``
Ciółkowo
''
;
north-east
of
Płock
)
of
January
22
,
1863
,
was
the
first
skirmish
of
the
January
Uprising
.


Fought
between
an
unorganised
Polish
troop
of
ca
.


100
men
under
Aleksander
Rogaliński
and
a
company
of
the
Russian
Murom
Regiment
under
Col.
Kozlaninov
,
the
skirmish
resulted
in
Polish
victory
.


As
the
engagement
started
on
the
very
first
day
of
the
uprising
,
the
Russian
force
still
obeyed
the
orders
of
marching
through
the
occupied
country
with
their
rifles
unloaded
.


When
the
Russians
approached
a
local
manor
in
which
the
Poles
had
their
quarters
,
the
Russian
commander
ordered
a
loose
formation
and
tried
to
negotiate
an
agreement
and
take
all
Poles
into
captivity
.


However
,
Rogaliński
refused
to
negotiate
and
ordered
a
charge
of
the
Russians
.


After
a
short
hand-to-hand
fight
(
the
Polish
unit
had
only
two
pieces
of
firearms
and
was
mostly
equipped
with
sabres
,
war
scythes
and
improvised
weapons
)
,
the
Russian
commander
was
killed
and
his
unit
dispersed
.


Polish
losses
were
negligible
,
but
the
Polish
commander
was
wounded
and
lost
his
eye
.


The
Malabar
Riot
(
also
known
as
the
Moplah
Genocide
and
``
Māppila
Lahaḷa
''
)
was
an
armed
uprising
in
1921
against
British
authority
in
the
Malabar
region
of
Southern
India
by
Mappilas
and
the
culmination
of
a
series
of
Mappila
revolts
that
recurred
throughout
the
19th
century
and
early
20th
century
.


The
1921
riot
began
as
a
reaction
against
a
heavy-handed
crackdown
on
the
Khilafat
Movement
,
a
campaign
in
defense
of
the
Ottoman
Caliphate
,
by
the
British
authorities
in
the
Eranad
and
Valluvanad
``
taluks
''
of
Malabar
.


In
the
initial
stages
,
the
movement
had
the
support
of
Mahatma
Gandhi
and
other
congress/
national
movement
leaders
,
a
number
of
minor
clashes
took
place
between
Khilafat
volunteers
and
the
police
,
but
the
violence
soon
spread
across
the
region
.


The
Mappilas
attacked
and
took
control
of
police
stations
,
British
government
offices
,
courts
and
government
treasuries
.


The
British
Government
put
down
the
rebellion
with
an
iron
fist
,
British
and
Gurkha
regiments
were
sent
to
the
area
and
Martial
Law
imposed
.


One
of
the
most
noteworthy
events
during
the
suppression
later
came
to
be
known
as
the
``
Wagon
tragedy
''
,
in
which
67
out
of
a
total
of
90
Mappila
prisoners
destined
for
the
Central
Prison
in
Podanur
suffocated
to
death
in
a
closed
railway
goods
wagon
.


For
six
months
from
August
1921
,
the
rebellion
extended
over
–
some
40
%
of
the
South
Malabar
region
of
the
Madras
Presidency
.


An
estimated
10,000
people
lost
their
lives
,
although
official
figures
put
the
numbers
at
2337
rebels
killed
,
1652
injured
and
45,404
imprisoned
.


Unofficial
estimates
put
the
number
imprisoned
at
almost
50,000
of
whom
20,000
were
deported
,
mainly
to
the
penal
colony
in
the
Andaman
Islands
,
while
around
10,000
went
missing
.


The
most
prominent
leaders
of
the
rebellion
were
Variankunnath
Kunjahammad
Haji
,
Sithi
Koya
Thangal
and
Ali
Musliyar
.


Contemporary
British
administrators
and
modern
historians
differ
markedly
in
their
assessment
of
the
incident
,
debating
whether
the
revolts
were
triggered
off
by
religious
fanaticism
or
agrarian
grievances
.


At
the
time
,
the
Indian
National
Congress
repudiated
the
movement
and
it
remained
isolated
from
the
wider
nationalist
movement
.


However
,
contemporary
Indian
evaluations
now
view
the
rebellion
as
a
national
upheaval
against
British
authority
and
the
most
important
event
concerning
the
political
movement
in
Malabar
during
the
period
.


In
its
magnitude
and
extent
,
it
was
an
unprecedented
popular
upheaval
,
the
likes
of
which
has
not
been
seen
in
Kerala
before
or
since
.


While
the
Mappilas
were
in
the
vanguard
of
the
movement
and
bore
the
brunt
of
the
struggle
,
several
non-Mappila
leaders
actively
sympathised
with
the
rebels
'
cause
,
giving
the
uprising
the
character
of
a
national
upheaval
.


In
1971
,
the
Government
of
Kerala
officially
recognised
the
active
participants
in
the
events
as
``
freedom
fighters
''
.


The
Borrowed
Heaven
Tour
is
the
fourth
concert
tour
by
Irish
band
,
The
Corrs
,
Beginning
summer
2004
,
the
tour
promoted
the
band
's
fourth
studio
album
,
``
Borrowed
Heaven
''
.


With
nearly
70
shows
,
the
tour
visited
Europe
and
North
America
.


It
marks
the
first
headlining
tour
for
the
band
in
North
America
.


It
also
serves
as
the
last
headlining
tour
before
the
band
went
into
hiatus
.


Two
new
members
joined
the
group
during
the
tour
–
Jason
Duffy
on
drums
and
Kieran
Kiely
on
keyboards
.


Jason
Duffy
joined
the
band
after
Caroline
Corr
announced
her
pregnancy
and
was
unable
to
cross
the
Atlantic
Ocean
for
the
North
American
leg
.


Caroline
was
moved
to
percussion
which
would
be
easier
for
her
as
the
months
progressed
.

show
at
the
SEG

Operation
Dragoon
(
initially
Operation
Anvil
)
was
the
code
name
for
the
Allied
invasion
of
Southern
France
on
15August
1944
.


The
operation
was
initially
planned
to
be
executed
in
conjunction
with
Operation
Overlord
,
the
Allied
landing
in
Normandy
,
but
the
lack
of
available
resources
led
to
a
cancellation
of
the
second
landing
.


By
July
1944
the
landing
was
reconsidered
,
as
the
clogged-up
ports
in
Normandy
did
not
have
the
capacity
to
adequately
supply
the
Allied
forces
.


Concurrently
,
the
French
High
Command
pushed
for
a
revival
of
the
operation
that
would
include
large
numbers
of
French
troops
.


As
a
result
,
the
operation
was
finally
approved
in
July
to
be
executed
in
August
.


The
goal
of
the
invasion
was
to
secure
the
vital
ports
on
the
French
Mediterranean
coast
and
increase
pressure
on
the
German
forces
by
opening
another
front
.


After
some
preliminary
commando
operations
,
the
US
VI
Corps
landed
on
the
beaches
of
the
Côte
d'Azur
under
the
shield
of
a
large
naval
task
force
,
followed
by
several
divisions
of
the
French
Army
B
.


They
were
opposed
by
the
scattered
forces
of
the
German
Army
Group
G
,
which
had
been
weakened
by
the
relocation
of
its
divisions
to
other
fronts
and
the
replacement
of
its
soldiers
with
third-rate
``
Ostlegionen
''
outfitted
with
obsolete
equipment
.


hindered
by
total
allied
air
superiority
and
a
large-scale
uprising
by
the
french
resistance
,
the
weak
german
forces
were
swiftly
defeated
.


The
Germans
withdrew
to
the
north
through
the
Rhône
valley
,
to
establish
a
stable
defense
line
at
Dijon
.


Allied
mobile
units
were
able
to
overtake
the
Germans
and
partially
block
their
route
at
the
town
of
Montélimar
.


The
ensuing
battle
led
to
a
stalemate
,
with
neither
side
able
to
achieve
a
decisive
breakthrough
,
until
the
Germans
were
finally
able
to
complete
their
withdrawal
and
retreat
from
the
town
.


While
the
Germans
were
retreating
,
the
French
managed
to
capture
the
important
ports
of
Marseille
and
Toulon
,
putting
them
into
operation
soon
after
.


The
Germans
were
not
able
to
hold
Dijon
and
ordered
a
complete
withdrawal
from
Southern
France
.


Army
GroupG
retreated
further
north
,
pursued
by
Allied
forces
.


The
fighting
ultimately
came
to
a
stop
at
the
Vosges
mountains
,
where
Army
GroupG
was
finally
able
to
establish
a
stable
defense
line
.


After
meeting
with
the
Allied
units
from
Operation
Overlord
,
the
Allied
forces
were
in
need
of
reorganizing
and
,
facing
stiffened
German
resistance
,
the
offensive
was
halted
on
14September
.


Operation
Dragoon
was
considered
a
success
by
the
Allies
.


It
enabled
them
to
liberate
most
of
Southern
France
in
a
time
span
of
only
four
weeks
,
while
inflicting
heavy
casualties
on
the
German
forces
,
although
a
substantial
part
of
the
best
German
units
were
able
to
escape
.


The
captured
French
ports
were
put
into
operation
,
allowing
the
Allies
to
solve
their
supply
problems
soon
after
.


The
anti-austerity
movement
in
Greece
involves
a
series
of
demonstrations
and
general
strikes
that
took
place
across
the
country
.


The
events
,
which
began
on
5
May
2010
,
were
provoked
by
plans
to
cut
public
spending
and
raise
taxes
as
austerity
measures
in
exchange
for
a
bail-out
,
aimed
at
solving
the
Greek
government-debt
crisis
.


Three
people
were
killed
on
5
May
in
one
of
the
largest
demonstrations
in
Greece
since
1973
.


On

movement
,
known
as
the
Indignant
Citizens
Movement
(
,
``
Kínima
Aganaktisménon-Politón
''
)
,
started
demonstrating
in
major
cities
across
Greece
.


This
second
wave
of
demonstrations
proved
different
from
the
years
before
in
that
they
were
not
partisan
and
began
through
peaceful
means
.


Some
of
the
events
later
turned
violent
,
particularly
in
the
capital
city
of
Athens
.


Inspired
by
the
anti-austerity
protests
in
Spain
,
these
demonstrations
were
organised
entirely
using
social
networking
sites
,
which
earned
it
the
nickname
``
May
of
Facebook
''
.


The
demonstrations
and
square
sit-ins
were
officially
ended
when
municipal
police
removed
demonstrators
from
Thessaloniki
's
White
Tower
square
on
7
August
2011
.


On
29
June
2011
,
violent
clashes
occurred
between
the
riot
police
and
activists
as
the
Greek
parliament
voted
to
accept
the
EU
's
austerity
requirements
.


Incidents
of
police
brutality
were
reported
by
international
media
such
as
the
BBC
,
``
The
Guardian
''
,
CNN
iReport
and
``
The
New
York
Times
''
,
as
well
as
by
academic
research
and
organisations
Amnesty
International
.


The
Athens
Prosecutor
agreed
to
an
investigation
into
accusations
of
excessive
use
of
tear
gas
,
as
well
as
the
alleged
use
of
other
expired
and
carcinogenic
chemical
substances
.


the
investigation
is
under
way
.


The
Herrin
massacre
took
place
on
June
21–22
,
1922
in
Herrin
,
Illinois
,
in
a
coal
mining
area
during
a
nationwide
strike
by
the
United
Mineworkers
of
America
(
UMWA
)
.


although
the
owner
of
the
mine
originally
agreed
with
the
union
to
observe
the
strike
,
when
the
price
of
coal
went
up
,
he
hired
non-union
workers
to
produce
and
ship
out
coal
,
as
he
had
high
debt
in
start-up
costs
.


After
an
exchange
of
gunfire
by
armed
guards
and
union
miners
,
three
miners
and
20
non-miners
were
killed
,
including
the
superintendent
and
19
strikebreakers
.


Enraged
that
the
owner
had
disregarded
their
agreement
,
on
June
21
,
union
miners
shot
at
strikebreakers
going
to
work
,
where
the
mine
had
armed
guards
.


When
striking
union
members
armed
themselves
and
laid
siege
to
the
mine
,
the
owner
's
guards
shot
and
killed
three
white
union
miners
in
an
exchange
of
gunfire
.


The
next
day
,
union
miners
killed
superintendent
McDowell
and
18
of
50
strikebreakers
and
mine
guards
,
many
of
them
brutally
.


A
twentieth
victim
from
the
non-union
group
was
later
murdered
,
bringing
the
death
total
to
23
.


The
Winter
War
was
a
military
conflict
between
the
Soviet
Union
(
USSR
)
and
Finland
.


it
began
with
a
soviet
invasion
of
finland
on
30
november
1939
,
three
months
after
the
outbreak
of
world
war
ii
,
and
ended
three
and
a
half
months
later
with
the
moscow
peace
treaty
on
13
march
1940
.


The
League
of
Nations
deemed
the
attack
illegal
and
expelled
the
Soviet
Union
from
the
organisation
.


The
conflict
began
after
the
Soviets
sought
to
obtain
some
Finnish
territory
,
demanding
among
other
concessions
that
Finland
cede
substantial
border
territories
in
exchange
for
land
elsewhere
,
claiming
security
reasons—primarily
the
protection
of
Leningrad
,
from
the
Finnish
border
.


Finland
refused
,
so
the
USSR
invaded
the
country
.


Many
sources
conclude
that
the
Soviet
Union
had
intended
to
conquer
all
of
Finland
,
and
use
the
establishment
of
the
puppet
Finnish
Communist
government
and
the
Molotov–Ribbentrop
Pact
's
secret
protocols
as
evidence
of
this
,
while
other
sources
argue
against
the
idea
of
the
full
Soviet
conquest
.


Finland
repelled
Soviet
attacks
for
more
than
two
months
and
inflicted
substantial
losses
on
the
invaders
while
temperatures
ranged
as
low
as
.


After
the
Soviet
military
reorganised
and
adopted
different
tactics
,
they
renewed
their
offensive
in
February
and
overcame
Finnish
defences
.


hostilities
ceased
in
march
1940
with
the
signing
of
the
moscow
peace
treaty
.


Finland
ceded

percent
of
its
territory
representing
30
percent
of
its
economy
to
the
Soviet
Union
.


Soviet
losses
were
heavy
,
and
the
country
's
international
reputation
suffered
.


Soviet
gains
exceeded
their
pre-war
demands
and
the
USSR
received
substantial
territory
along
Lake
Ladoga
and
in
northern
Finland
.


Finland
retained
its
sovereignty
and
enhanced
its
international
reputation
.


The
poor
performance
of
the
Red
Army
encouraged
Adolf
Hitler
to
think
that
an
attack
on
the
Soviet
Union
would
be
successful
and
confirmed
negative
Western
opinions
of
the
Soviet
military
.


After
15
months
of
Interim
Peace
,
in
June
1941
,
Nazi
Germany
commenced
Operation
Barbarossa
and
the
Continuation
War
between
Finland
and
the
USSR
began
.


The
2006
Hezbollah
cross-border
raid
was
a
cross-border
attack
carried
out
by
Lebanon-based
Hezbollah
militants
on
an
Israeli
military
patrol
on
12
July
2006
on
Israeli
territory
.


Using
rockets
fired
on
several
Israeli
towns
as
a
diversion
,
Hezbollah
militants
crossed
from
Lebanon
into
Israel
and
ambushed
two
Israeli
Army
vehicles
,
killing
three
soldiers
and
capturing
two
other
soldiers
.


Another
five
soldiers
were
killed
inside
Lebanese
territory
in
a
failed
rescue
attempt
.


Hezbollah
demanded
the
release
of
Lebanese
prisoners
held
by
Israel
in
exchange
for
the
release
of
the
captured
soldiers
.


Israel
refused
and
launched
a
large-scale
ground
and
air
campaign
across
Lebanon
in
response
to
the
Hezbollah
raid
.


This
marked
the
start
of
the
2006
Lebanon
War
.


Two
years
later
,
on
16
July
2008
,
the
bodies
of
the
two
captured
soldiers
were
returned
to
Israel
by
Hezbollah
in
exchange
for
Samir
Kuntar
and
four
Hezbollah
prisoners
.


hezbollah
originally
named
the
cross-border
operation
``
freedom

''
,
but
eventually
shortened
it
to
``

The
first
Mongol
invasions
of
Burma
(
present-day
Myanmar
)
(
)
were
a
series
of
military
conflicts
between
Kublai
Khan
's
Yuan
dynasty
,
division
of
the
Mongol
Empire
,
and
the
Pagan
Empire
that
took
place
between
1277
and
1287
.


The
invasions
toppled
the
250-year-old
Pagan
Empire
,
and
the
Mongol
army
seized
Pagan
territories
in
present-day
Dehong
,
Yunnan
and
northern
Burma
to
Tagaung
.


The
invasions
ushered
in
250
years
of
political
fragmentation
in
Burma
and
the
rise
of
ethnic
Tai-Shan
states
throughout
mainland
Southeast
Asia
.


The
Mongols
first
demanded
tribute
from
Pagan
in
1271–72
,
as
part
of
their
drive
to
encircle
the
Song
dynasty
of
China
.


When
King
Narathihapate
refused
,
Emperor
Kublai
Khan
himself
sent
another
mission
in
1273
,
again
demanding
tribute
.


It
too
was
rejected
.


In
1275
,
the
emperor
ordered
the
Yunnan
government
to
secure
the
borderlands
in
order
to
block
an
escape
path
for
the
Song
,
and
permitted
a
limited
border
war
if
Pagan
contested
.


Pagan
did
contest
but
its
army
was
driven
back
at
the
frontier
by
the
Mongol
Army
in
1277–78
.


After
a
brief
lull
,
Kublai
Khan
in
1281
turned
his
attention
to
Southeast
Asia
,
demanding
tribute
from
Pagan
,
the
Khmer
Empire
,
Đại
Việt
and
Champa
.


When
the
Burmese
king
again
refused
,
the
emperor
ordered
an
invasion
of
northern
Burma
.


Two
dry
season
campaigns
(
1283–85
)
later
,
the
Mongols
had
occupied
down
to
Tagaung
and
Hanlin
,
forcing
the
Burmese
king
to
flee
to
Lower
Burma
.


The
Mongols
organized
northern
Burma
as
the
province
of
Zhengmian
.


Ceasefire
negotiations
began
in
1285
,
and
ended
with
Narathihapate
finally
agreeing
to
submit
in
June
1286
.


The
Burmese
embassy
,
received
by
the
emperor
in
Beijing
in
January
1287
,
agreed
to
a
treaty
that
acknowledged
the
suzerainty
of
the
Yuan
dynasty
or
the
Mongol
Empire
over
the
Pagan
Empire
and
annual
payments
in
taxes
to
the
Yunnan
government
in
exchange
for
the
evacuation
of
Mongol
troops
from
northern
Burma
.


But
the
treaty
never
really
took
effect
as
Narathihapate
was
assassinated
in
July
1287
,
and
no
authority
who
could
honor
the
treaty
emerged
.


The
Mongol
command
at
Yunnan
now
deemed
the
imperial
order
to
withdraw
void
,
and
ordered
an
invasion
of
central
Burma
.


They
may
not
have
reached
Pagan
,
and
even
if
they
did
,
after
having
suffered
heavy
casualties
,
they
returned
to
Tagaung
.


The
Pagan
Empire
disintegrated
and
anarchy
ensued
.


The
Mongols
,
who
probably
preferred
the
situation
,
did
nothing
to
restore
order
in
the
next
ten
years
.


In
March
1297
,
they
accepted
the
voluntary
submission
of
King
Kyawswa
of
Pagan
although
he
controlled
little
beyond
the
capital
city
of
Pagan
(
Bagan
)
.


But
Kyawswa
was
overthrown
nine
months
later
,
and
the
Mongols
were
forced
to
intervene
,
leading
to
their
second
invasion
in
1300–01
.


Marco
Polo
reported
the
first
invasions
(
1277–87
)
in
his
travelogue
,
``
Il
Milione
''
.


The
Burmese
referred
to
the
invaders
as
the
``
Taruk
''
(
after
the
central
Asian
Turkic
troops
that
largely
made
up
the
Mongol
invasion
army
)
;
today
,
the
term
``
Taruk
''
(
)
refers
to
the
Han
Chinese
instead
.


King
Narathihapate
is
unkindly
remembered
in
Burmese
history
as
Taruk-Pye
Min
,
(
``
the
King
who
Fled
from
the
``
Taruk
''
''
)
.


The
Jin–Song
Wars
were
a
series
of
conflicts
between
the
Jurchen
Jin
dynasty
(
1115–1234
)
and
Han
Chinese
Song
dynasty
(
960–1279
)
.


In
1115
,
Jurchen
tribes
rebelled
against
their
overlords
,
the
Khitan
Liao
dynasty
(
907–1125
)
,
and
declared
the
formation
of
the
Jin
.


Allying
with
the
Song
against
their
common
enemy
the
Liao
dynasty
,
the
Jin
promised
to
return
to
the
Song
the
Sixteen
Prefectures
that
had
fallen
under
Liao
control
since
938
.


The
Chinese
agreed
but
the
Jurchens
'
quick
defeat
of
the
Liao
dynasty
combined
with
Song
dynasty
military
failures
made
the
Jin
reluctant
to
cede
these
territories
.


After
a
series
of
negotiations
that
embittered
both
sides
,
the
Jurchens
attacked
the
Song
dynasty
in
1125
,
dispatching
one
army
to
Taiyuan
and
the
other
to
Bianjing
(
modern
Kaifeng
)
,
the
Song
capital
.


Surprised
by
news
of
an
invasion
,
Song
general
Tong
Guan
retreated
from
Taiyuan
,
which
was
besieged
and
later
captured
.


As
the
second
Jin
army
approached
the
capital
,
Song
emperor
Huizong
abdicated
and
fled
south
.


Qinzong
,
his
eldest
son
,
was
enthroned
.


The
Jurchens
laid
siege
to
Kaifeng
in
1126
,
but
Qinzong
negotiated
their
retreat
from
the
capital
by
agreeing
to
a
large
annual
indemnity
.


Qinzong
reneged
on
the
deal
and
ordered
Song
forces
to
defend
the
prefectures
instead
of
fortifying
the
capital
.


The
Jin
resumed
war
and
again
besieged
Kaifeng
in
1127
.


They
captured
Emperor
Qinzong
of
Song
,
many
members
of
the
imperial
family
and
high
officials
of
the
Song
imperial
court
in
an
event
known
as
the
Jingkang
Incident
.


This
separated
north
and
south
China
between
Jin
and
Song
.


Remnants
of
the
Song
imperial
family
retreated
to
southern
China
and
,
after
brief
stays
in
several
temporary
capitals
,
eventually
relocated
to
Lin'an
(
modern
Hangzhou
)
.


The
retreat
divided
the
dynasty
into
two
distinct
periods
,
Northern
Song
and
Southern
Song
.


The
Jurchens
tried
to
conquer
southern
China
in
the
1130s
,
but
were
bogged
down
by
a
pro-Song
insurgency
in
the
north
and
a
counteroffensive
by
Song
generals
Yue
Fei
,
Han
Shizhong
,
and
others
.


The
Song
generals
regained
some
territories
but
retreated
on
the
orders
of
Southern
Song
emperor
Gaozong
,
who
supported
a
peaceful
resolution
to
the
war
.


the
treaty
of
shaoxing
(
1142
)
set
the
boundary
of
the
two
empires
along
the
huai
river
,
but
conflicts
between
the
two
dynasties
continued
until
the
fall
of
the
jin
in
1234
.


A
war
against
the
Song
begun
by
4th
Jin
emperor
,
Wanyan
Liang
,
was
unsuccessful
.


He
lost
the
Battle
of
Caishi
(
1161
)
and
was
later
assassinated
by
his
own
disaffected
officers
.


An
invasion
of
Jin
territory
motivated
by
Song
revanchism
(
1206–1208
)
was
also
unsuccessful
.


A
decade
later
,
the
Jin
launched
an
abortive
military
campaign
against
the
Song
in
1217
to
replace
territory
they
had
lost
to
the
invading
Mongols
.


The
Song
allied
with
the
Mongols
in
1233
,
and
in
the
next
year
jointly
captured
Caizhou
,
last
refuge
of
the
Jin
emperor
.


The
Jin
dynasty
collapsed
that
year
in
1234
.


After
the
demise
of
the
Jin
,
the
Song
dynasty
itself
became
a
target
of
the
Mongols
,
and
collapsed
in
1279
.


The
wars
engendered
an
era
of
swift
technological
,
cultural
,
and
demographic
changes
in
China
.


Battles
between
the
Song
and
Jin
brought
about
the
introduction
of
various
gunpowder
weapons
.


The
siege
of
De'an
in
1132
was
the
first
recorded
use
of
the
fire
lance
,
an
early
ancestor
of
firearms
.


There
were
also
reports
of
battles
fought
with
rudimentary
gunpowder
bombs
like
the
incendiary
``
huopao
''
or
the
exploding
``
tiehuopao
''
,
incendiary
arrows
,
and
other
related
weapons
.


In
northern
China
,
Jurchens
were
the
ruling
minority
of
an
empire
predominantly
inhabited
by
former
subjects
of
the
Song
.


Jurchen
migrants
settled
in
the
conquered
territories
and
assimilated
with
the
local
culture
.


The
Jin
,
a
conquest
dynasty
,
instituted
a
centralized
imperial
bureaucracy
modeled
on
previous
Chinese
dynasties
,
basing
their
legitimacy
on
Confucian
philosophy
.


Song
refugees
from
the
north
resettled
in
southern
China
.


The
north
was
the
cultural
center
of
China
,
and
its
conquest
by
the
Jin
diminished
the
regional
stature
of
the
Song
dynasty
.


The
Southern
Song
,
however
,
quickly
returned
to
economic
prosperity
,
and
trade
with
the
Jin
was
lucrative
despite
decades
of
warfare
.


Lin'an
,
the
Southern
Song
capital
,
expanded
into
a
major
city
for
commerce
.


Operation
Medak
Pocket
(
,
Операција
Медачки
џеп
)
was
a
military
operation
undertaken
by
the
Croatian
Army
between
9
–
17
September
1993
,
in
which
a
salient
reaching
the
south
suburbs
of
Gospić
,
in
the
south-central
Lika
region
of
Croatia
then
under
the
control
of
the
self-proclaimed
Republic
of
Serbian
Krajina
,
was
attacked
by
Croatian
forces
.


The
pocket
was
named
after
the
village
of
Medak
.


The
Croatian
offensive
temporarily
succeeded
in
expelling
rebel
Serb
forces
from
the
pocket
after
several
days
of
fighting
.


However
,
the
operation
ended
in
controversy
due
to
the
skirmish
with
United
Nations
peacekeepers
and
accusations
of
serious
Croatian
war
crimes
against
local
Serb
civilians
.


although
the
outcome
of
the
battle
against
the
serbs
was
a
tactical
victory
for
the
croatians
,
it
became
a
serious
political
liability
for
the
croatian
government
and
international
political
pressure
forced
a
withdrawal
to
the
previous
ceasefire
lines
.


According
to
UN
and
Canadian
sources
,
UNPROFOR
personnel
and
Croatian
troops
exchanged
heavy
fire
,
eventually
resulting
in
the
Canadian
troops
driving
off
a
Croatian
assault
.


In
Canada
,
the
battle
was
considered
to
be
one
of
the
most
severe
battles
fought
by
the
Canadian
Forces
since
the
Korean
War
.


Alan
Parsons
'
``
A
Walk
Down
Abbey
Road
''
was
a
concert
tour
which
was
launched
in
North
America
in
2001
to
pay
tribute
to
The
Beatles
and
promote
the
hits
of
various
headlining
band
members
.


Similar
to
Ringo
Starr
's
``
All
Starr
Band
''
tours
,
each
successive
year
the
band
members
swapped
out
and
featured
the
songs
of
the
new
line-up
.


The
first
set
included
all
band
members
assembled
to
play
each
other
's
hits
.


The
second
set
featured
all
Beatles
songs
performed
by
various
band
members
depending
on
the
specific
tune
and
the
strength
and
style
of
the
performer
.


although
certainly
successful
enough
to
continue
over
two
years
,
the
show
was
mired
by
some
problems
,
not
the
least
of
which
was
prohibitive
concessions
having
to
be
paid
to
the
beatles
for
the
use
of
the
name
``
abbey
road
''
.


An
obvious
play
on
concert-goers
expectations
with
Who
bassist
John
Entwistle
in
the
group
,
the
second
song
of
the
opening
set
was
``
Open
My
Eyes
''
from
Todd
Rundgren
's
first
band
,
The
Nazz
.


The
chord
pattern
at
the
beginning
is
lifted
directly
from
The
Who
's
``
I
Ca
n't
Explain
''
.


It
was
one
of
Entwistle
's
last
concert
series
as
he
died
on
27
June
2002
,
one
day
before

The
Tehran
Conference
(
codenamed
Eureka
)
was
a
strategy
meeting
of
Joseph
Stalin
,
Franklin
D.
Roosevelt
,
and
Winston
Churchill
from
28
November
to
1
December
1943
,
after
the
Anglo-Soviet
Invasion
of
Iran
.


It
was
held
in
the
Soviet
Union
's
embassy
in
Tehran
,
Iran
.


It
was
the
first
of
the
World
War
II
conferences
of
the
``
Big
Three
''
Allied
leaders
(
the
Soviet
Union
,
the
United
States
,
and
the
United
Kingdom
)
.


It
closely
followed
the
Cairo
Conference
which
had
taken
place
on
22–26
November
1943
,
and
preceded
the
1945
Yalta
and
Potsdam
conferences
.


although
the
three
leaders
arrived
with
differing
objectives
,
the
main
outcome
of
the
tehran
conference
was
the
western
allies
'
commitment
to
open
a
second
front
against
nazi
germany
.


The
conference
also
addressed
the
'Big
Three
'
Allies
'
relations
with
Turkey
and
Iran
,
operations
in
Yugoslavia
and
against
Japan
,
and
the
envisaged
post-war

.


A
separate
protocol
signed
at
the

pledged
the

to
recognize

's
independence
.


Hurricane
Elida
was
the
first
hurricane
of
the
2002
Pacific
hurricane
season
to
reach
Category
5
strength
on
the
Saffir-Simpson
Hurricane
Scale
.


Forming
on
July
23
from
a
tropical
wave
,
the
storm
rapidly
intensified
from
a
tropical
depression
into
a
Category
5
hurricane
in
two
days
,
and
lasted
for
only
six
hours
at
that
intensity
before
weakening
.


It
was
one
of
only
sixteen
known
hurricanes
in
the
East
Pacific
east
of
the
International
Date
Line
to
have
reached
such
an
intensity
.


although
heavy
waves
were
able
to
reach
the
mexican
coastline
,
no
damages
or
casualties
were
reported
in
relation
to
the
hurricane
.


The
hurricane
moved
westward
due
to
a
high
pressure
ridge
while
undergoing
two
eyewall
replacement
cycles
:
the
first
was
around
peak
intensity
and
was
completed
when
the
hurricane
moved
over
cooler
waters
,
and
the
second
was
a
brief
cycle
shortly
after
the
hurricane
began
to
weaken
.


The
last
advisory
was
issued
while
the
hurricane
was
west
of
Mexico
,
but
it
was
not
until
the
remnants
were
west
of
Los
Angeles
,
California
that
they
finally
dissipated
.


Elida
's
rapid
intensification
and
unsteady
weakening
after
reaching
its
peak
intensity
caused
large
errors
in
the
intensity
forecasting
of
the
hurricane
.


although
the
intensity
forecasts
were
off
,
the
track
forecasts
were
better
than
usual
compared
to
the
ten-year
period
prior
to
that
year
.


The
2012
Romanian
protests
were
a
series
of
protests
and
civil
manifestations
triggered
by
the
introduction
of
new
health
reform
legislation
.


In
particular
,
President
Traian
Băsescu
criticized
the
Deputy
Minister
of
Health
,
Raed
Arafat
,
on
a
Romanian
television
broadcast
.


The
protests
became
violent
,
with
both
protesters
and
members
of
the
Gendarmerie
sustaining
injuries
during
their
clashes
.


On
the
morning
of
5
February
2012
,
Prime
Minister
Emil
Boc
announced
his
resignation
because
of
the
protests
.


He
said
that
his
decision
would
,
Release
the
tension
in
the
country
's
political
and
social
situation
.


Protests
,
on
a
lesser
scale
,
continued
in
University
Square
in
Bucharest
.


The
protesters
demanded
the
president
's
resignation
and
early
general
elections
.


There
were
ongoing
protests
in
Romania
in
subsequent
months
over
a
variety
of
disagreements
.

)
.


It
took
place
on
February
24
,
2005
,
in
Bratislava

Slovakia
.


This
marked
the
first
occasion
when
a
sitting

of
the
United
States
visited
Slovakia
since
its
independence
in
1993
.


The

Prior
to
the
summit
,
Bush
had
travelled
to
Brussels
and
met
with
several
European
leaders

,
and
gave
a
public
speech
directed
at
citizens
of
Europe
outlining
his
policies
.


He
then
travelled
to
Germany
and
met
with
Gerhard

The
Swedish
invasion
of
the
Holy
Roman
Empire
,
or
the
Swedish
Intervention
in
the
Thirty
Years
'
War
is
a
historically
accepted
division
of
the
Thirty
Years
'
War
.


It
was
a
military
conflict
that
took
place
between
1630
and
1635
,
during
the
course
of
the
Thirty
Years
'
War
.


It
was
a
major
turning
point
of
the
war
,
the
Protestant
cause
,
previously
on
the
verge
of
defeat
,
won
several
major
victories
and
changed
the
direction
of
the
War
.


The
Habsburg-Catholic
coalition
,
previously
in
the
ascendant
,
was
significantly
weakened
as
a
result
of
the
gains
the
Protestant
cause
made
.


It
is
often
considered
to
be
an
independent
conflict
by
most
historians
.


After
several
attempts
by
the
Holy
Roman
Empire
to
prevent
and
contain
the
spread
of
Protestantism
in
Europe
,
King
Gustav
II
Adolf
of
Sweden
led
an
invasion
of
the
Holy
Roman
Empire
.


although
he
was
killed
in
battle
at
UNK
,
southwest
of
leipzig
,
the
swedish
armies
managed
to
successfully
defeat
their
catholic
enemies
and
established
sweden
as
one
of
the
great
powers
of
europe
for
the
next
100
years
.


His
leadership
of
the
Protestant
powers
of
Germany
and
Europe
was
critical
to
the
establishment
of
an
alternative
branch
of
Christianity
recognized
in
Germany
,
and
ensconced
it
in
some
forms
of
international
law
and
custom
.


Additionally
,
it
rolled
back
the
gains
the
Habsburg
family
had
made
in
re-centralizing
political
power
in
the
Holy
Roman
Empire
in
the
hands
of
the
Holy
Roman
Emperor
.


The
Swedish
invasion
confirmed
the
role
of
Holy
Roman
Emperor
as
a
ceremonial
,
de
jure
position
within
the
constitution
of
the
Holy
Roman
Empire
.


The
new
European
great
power
of
Sweden
would
last
for
a
hundred
years
before
being
overwhelmed
by
numerous
enemies
in
the
Great
Northern
War
.


The
long-term
political
consequences
of
the
Protestant
victory
include
the
Holy
Roman
Empire
emphasising
decentralization
of
power
to
local
magnates
and
dynasts
.


Protestant
victory
and
liberty
of
religion
thereby
assured
the
political
and
national
decentralization
of
the
Empire
for
several
centuries
,
and
made
it
vulnerable
to
foreign
domination
.


The
religious
and
political
divisions
sowed
by
the
conflict
blocked
centralization
as
was
occurring
in
France
,
England
and
Spain
at
the
time
.


Political
Unification
of
Germany
would
only
occur
centuries
later
.


Religious
And
Political
Underpinnings
of
the
Thirty
Years
War
–
The
Bohemian
Revolt
.


The
Thirty
Years
War
was
a
religious
conflict
between
Protestants
and
Catholics
in
Germany
.


It
originated
in
the
commingling
of
politics
and
religion
that
was
common
in
Europe
at
the
time
.


Its
distal
causes
reside
in
the
previous
century
,
at
the
political-religious
settlement
of
the
Holy
Roman
Empire
known
as
the
Peace
of
Augsburg
.


The
peace
was
an
agreement
between
Charles
V
,
Holy
Roman
Emperor
and
the
Protestant
powers
of
the
Holy
Roman
Empire
in
the
16th
century
.


It
established
the
legitimacy
of
Lutheranism
in
Germany
and
allowed
Dukes
and
high
lords
to
expel
non-conforming
subjects
from
their
territory
.


Additionally
,
it
permitted
subjects
of
a
different
religion
to
peaceably
move
to
land
where
their
practices
would
be
recognized
and
respected
.


There
were
also
clauses
in
relation
to
ecclesiastical
lords
.


When
prelates
who
ruled
an
ecclesiastical
fiefdom
converted
,
the
expectation
was
placed
upon
them
to
resign
their
temporal
privileges
.


Some
of
these
treaty
stipulations
would
be
violated
on
various
occasions
,
as
was
the
case
with
Gebhard
Truchsess
von
Waldburg
,
Archbishop-Elector
of
Cologne
.


Despite
various
attempts
to
violate
the
provisions
in
the
Peace
of
Augsburg
no
general
European
or
German
conflagration
would
erupt
as
a
result
of
the
violations
.


at
the
end
of
the
conflicts
,
it
was
agreed
that
the
provisions
of
the
peace
of
augsburg
would
once
again
be
adhered
to
.


``
All
that
the
Lutheran
church
gained
by
the
Peace
of
Augsburg
was
toleration
;
all
that
the
[
Roman
]
church
conceded
was
a
sacrifice
to
necessity
,
not
an
offering
to
justice
''
says
one
historian
.


However
,
the
Peace
of
Augsburg
could
never
be
anything
but
a
temporary
cessation
of
hostilities
.


Its
provisions
contained
an
addendum
which
declared
that
it
would
only
become
active
without
reservation
upon
the
meeting
of
a
general
council
,
and
a
final
attempt
at
the
reunion
of
the
two
confessions
.


There
was
no
reason
to
believe
these
would
ever
happen
unless
the
Lutherans
were
forced
to
do
so
.


although
genuine
ideological
differences
did
drive
german
princes
to
convert
,
the
primary
motivation
of
many
was
often
the
acquisition
of
easy
riches
and
territory
at
the
expense
of
their
defenceless
catholic
neighbours
and
subjects
.


Princes
would
convert
on
the
grounds
that
they
would
be
empowered
to
seize
precious
land
and
property
from
the
Roman
Catholic
Church
,
and
turn
that
wealth
to
their
own
enrichment
.


The
Protestants
understood
and
accepted
as
an
article
of
faith
that
they
would
have
to
unite
against
the
Roman
Catholic
Church
to
preserve
themselves
against
Catholic
encroachment
and
eventual
Catholic
hegemony
.


However
,
the
Protestants
were
divided
.


Lutherans
held
to
articles
of
faith
that
were
mutually
exclusive
with
the
articles
espoused
by
Calvinists
.


The
Roman
Catholic
Church
did
everything
in
its
power
to
sow
controversy
and
intrigue
between
the
two
major
Protestant
factions
.


As
a
result
,
there
was
no
political
unity
of
German
Protestant
states
that
could
coordinate
actions
against
a
Catholic
interloper
.


It
was
regularly
maintained
by
both
religious
parties
that
the
other
regularly
encroached
on
the
spirit
or
the
letter
of
the
Peace
of
Augsburg
.


Indeed
,
it
was
understood
by
Protestants
that
Catholic
officials
(
especially
imperial
or
church
officials
)
were
vicious
and
jealous
of
the
privileges
acquired
by
the
Protestants
and
would
do
anything
in
their
power
to
harm
the
Protestant
cause
.


It
was
established
by
practice
that
the
Pope
had
the
power
to
relieve
members
of
his
flock
of
the
most
solumn
oaths
,
and
it
was
a
matter
of
principle
among
Catholics
that
faith
was
never
to
be
kept
with
heretics
.


On
the
other
hand
,
Catholics
maintained
a
similar
understanding
of
the
Protestants
.


The
avarice
displayed
by
Protestants
for
Church
property
could
not
fail
to
go
unnoticed
by
even
the
most
indulgent
Catholic
observer
.


With
such
mutual
antipathy
prevailing
between
the
Protestants
and
Catholics
of
Germany
,
nothing
that
could
would
fail
to
be
misunderstood
.


The
Thirty
Years
War
arose
out
of
a
regional
dispute
between
Bohemian
Protestants
and
their
Habsburg
monarchs
.


Rudolf
II
,
Holy
Roman
Emperor
was
an
obstinate
and
stubborn
monarch
.


His
policies
forced
him
into
an
increasingly
weak
position
with
his
heterogenous
subjects
,
his
court
and
his
family
.


Forced
to
make
concession
to
his
Hungarian
subjects
in
order
to
appease
them
for
his
indecisive
war
with
the
Ottoman
Empire
,
Rudolf
ceded
his
Hungarian
,
Austrian
and
Moravian
holdings
to
his
brother
,
Matthias
.


Seeing
weakness
and
discord
in
the
ranks
of
their
German
overlords
,
his
Bohemian
subjects
revolted
.


In
1609
,
Rudolf
granted
them
concessions
with
the
Letter
of
Majesty
which
included
religious
tolerance
and
a
church
for
the
Bohemian
Estate
controlled
by
the
Protestant
nobility
.


When
the
Protestant
estates
in
Bohemia
requested
even
more
liberties
,
Rudolf
sent
in
an
army
to
quiet
them
.


However
,
Matthias
seized
his
brother
at
the
request
of
the
Protestant
Bohemians
,
only
releasing
him
once
he
abdicated
his
Bohemian
crown
to
Matthias
.


Rudolf
II
died
a
couple
of
months
later
in
1611
,
at
which
point
his
brother
Matthias
acquired
the
rest
of
his
titles
,
including
that
of
Holy
Roman
Emperor
.


Being
without
heirs
,
in
1617
Matthias
had
his
cousin
Ferdinand
of
Styria
elected
King
of
Bohemia
,
a
gesture
which
amounted
to
naming
him
as
his
successor
.


They
were
related
through
their
paternal
grandfather
Ferdinand
I.
Ferdinand
of
Styria
,
or
Ferdinand
II
as
he
was
to
become
known
,
was
an
ardent
follower
of
Catholicism
and
the
counter-reformation
and
not
likely
to
be
as
willing
to
compromise
as
his
two
cousins
and
predecessors
on
the
Bohemian
throne
were
or
had
been
forced
to
do
by
circumstance
.


Ferdinand
had
not
received
his
Bohemian
throne
in
a
weak
position
,
as
Mathias
or
Rudolf
had
.


Matthias
had
acceded
to
the
Protestants
'
demands
to
allow
Protestant
religious
facilities
to
be
constructed
on
Bohemian
crown
lands
.


Ferdinand
was
to
reverse
the
construction
of
many
of
these
facilities
on
his
ascension
to
the
Bohemian
crown
,
and
when
the
Bohemian
estates
protested
,
he
dissolved
the
Bohemian
assembly
.


The
Second
Defenestration
of
Prague
was
the
immediate
trigger
for
the
Thirty
Year
's
War
.


In
May
1618
,
the
three
estates
of
the
dissolved
Bohemian
assembly
gathered
in
Prague
,
the
capital
of
the
Bohemian
kingdom
.


Protestant
noblemen
led
by
count
Jindřich
Matyáš
Thurn
,
recently
stripped
of
his
title
as
castellan
of
Karlstadt
by
the
Emperor
,
stormed
Prague
Castle
and
seized
two
imperial
governors
appointed
by
Ferdinand
,
Vilem
Slavata
of
Chlum
and
Jaroslav
Borzita
of
Martinice
,
and
two
imperial
secretaries
.


The
noblemen
held
a
trial
on
the
spot
,
found
the
Imperial
officials
guilty
of
violating
the
Letter
of
Majesty
,
and
threw
them
out
of
a
third-floor
window
of
the
Bohemian
Chancellery
.


The
entirety
of
these
proceedings
were
without
question
illegal
,
not
to
mention
reactionary
and
partisan
in
nature
.


There
was
nothing
even
legitimate
about
the
court
itself
,
that
it
was
a
lawfully
constituted
body
or
that
it
even
had
any
jurisdiction
over
the
case
in
question
.


By
happenstance
,
the
imperial
officials
'
lives
were
saved
by
them
landing
in
a
pile
of
manure
.


The
implications
of
the
event
were
immediately
apparent
to
both
sides
,
who
started
to
seek
support
from
their
allies
.


The
Bohemians
were
friendless
,
against
a
powerful
monarch
of
Europe
who
had
many
and
powerful
allies
,
and
who
was
a
scion
of
one
of
the
most
powerful
dynasties
in
Europe
who
stood
to
inherit
the
entirety
of
the
Emperor
's
dominions
.


The
Bohemians
made
offers
to
the
Duke
of
Savoy
,
Elector
of
Saxony
(
the
preferred
candidate
)
and
even
to
the
Prince
of
Transylvania
.


They
also
sought
admission
into
the
Protestant
Union
,
a
coalition
of
German
Protestant
states
formed
to
give
a
politico-military
unity
to
the
divided
German
Protestants
.


The
Elector
of
Saxony
's
refusal
of
the
Bohemian
crown
made
the
Elector
Palatine
the
most
senior
Protestant
available
to
the
Bohemians
.


In
addition
to
being
a
Protestant
,
albeit
a
Calvinist
,
Frederick
V
was
married
to
Elizabeth
Stuart
and
was
thereby
a
son-in-law
of
the
King
of
England
,
indisputably
the
most
powerful
Protestant
monarch
,
and
whose
aid
it
was
not
unreasonable
to
hope
for
.


However
the
act
of
unseating
Ferdinand
–
the
legitimately
chosen
monarch
of
Bohemia-
put
the
Bohemian
revolt
in
a
difficult
position
with
the
other
political
powers
of
Germany
and
Europe
.


John
George
I
of
Saxony
refused
the
election
,
and
discouraged
the
nascent
revolt
.


In
September
of
the
same
year
,
the
Protestant
Union
met
and
called
on
Frederick
not
to
intervene
in
the
conflict
.


The
Dutch
Republic
,
Charles
Emmanuel
of
Savoy
and
even
the
Republic
of
Venice
–
a
traditional
enemy
of
the
Pope
–
sent
letters
to
Frederick
informing
him
that
they
would
not
offer
him
assistance
if
he
accepted
the
Bohemian
crown
–
but
nonetheless
,
he
did
.


Turkish
Airlines
Flight
1951
(
also
known
as
the
Poldercrash
or
the
Schiphol
Polderbaan
incident
)
was
a
passenger
flight
that
crashed
during
landing
at
Amsterdam
Schiphol
Airport
,
Netherlands
,
on
25
February
2009
,
resulting
in
the
death
of
nine
passengers
and
crew
,
including
all
three
pilots
,
who
died
on
impact
.


The
aircraft
,
a
Turkish
Airlines
Boeing
737-800
,
crashed
into
a
field
approximately
north
of
the
Polderbaan
runway
,
(
18R
)
,
prior
to
crossing
the
A9
motorway
inbound
,
at
09:26
UTC
(
10:26
CET
)
,
having
flown
from
Istanbul
,
Turkey
.


The
aircraft
broke
into
three
pieces
on
impact
.


The
wreckage
did
not
catch
fire
.


The
crash
was
caused
primarily
by
the
aircraft
's
automated
reaction
,
which
was
triggered
by
a
faulty
radio
altimeter
.


This
caused
the
autothrottle
to
decrease
the
engine
power
to
idle
during
approach
.


The
crew
noticed
this
too
late
to
take
appropriate
action
to
increase
the
thrust
and
recover
the
aircraft
before
it
stalled
and
crashed
.


Boeing
has
since
issued
a
bulletin
to
remind
pilots
of
all
737
series
and
BBJ
aircraft
of
the
importance
of
monitoring
airspeed
and
altitude
,
advising
against
the
use
of
autopilot
or
autothrottle
while
landing
in
cases
of
radio
altimeter
discrepancies
.


On
16
January
2013
,
an
Agusta
A109
helicopter
crashed
in
Vauxhall
,
London
,
after
it
collided
with
the
jib
of
a
construction
crane
attached
to
St
George
Wharf
Tower
.


Two
people
died
in
the
incident
:
the
pilot
,
Pete
Barnes
,
50
,
and
a
pedestrian
,
Matthew
Wood
,
39
,
from
Sutton
in
south
London
.


Five
people
were
taken
to
hospital
and
seven
more
were
treated
at
the
scene
.


The
pilot
had
diverted
because
of
poor
visibility
.


The
official
report
concluded
he
was
probably
unaware
how
close
the
tower
was
,
and
that

The
Pike
River
Mine
disaster
was
a
coal
mining
accident
that
began
on
19
November
2010
in
the
Pike
River
Mine
,
northeast
of
Greymouth
,
in
the
West
Coast
region
of
New
Zealand
's
South
Island
.


A
methane
explosion
occurred
in
the
mine
at
approximately
3:44
pm
(
NZDT
,
UTC+13
)
.


At
the
time
of
the
explosion
31
miners
and
contractors
were
present
in
the
mine
.


Two
miners
managed
to
walk
from
the
mine
;
they
were
treated
for
moderate
injuries
and
released
from
Greymouth
Hospital
the
next
day
.


The
remaining
16
miners
and
13
contractors
were
believed
to
be
at
least
from
the
mine
's
entrance
.


Following
a
second
explosion
on
24
November
at
2:37
pm
,
the
29
remaining
men
were
believed
by
police
to
be
dead
.


Police
Superintendent
Gary
Knowles
,
officer
in
command
of
the
rescue
operation
(
Operation
Pike
)
said
he
believed
that
``
based
on
that
explosion
,
no
one
survived
.
''


A
third
explosion
occurred
at
3:39
pm
on
26
November
2010
,
and
a
fourth
explosion
occurred
just
before
2
pm
on
28
November
2010
.


According
to
the
new
mine
owner
,
Solid
Energy
,
the
bodies
of
the
29
miners
who
died
there
may
never
be
recovered
.


The
Pike
River
Mine
incident
ranks
as
New
Zealand
's
worst
mining
disaster
since
1914
,
when
43
men
died
at
Ralph
's
Mine
in
Huntly
.


it
also
resulted
in
the
country
's
worst
loss
of
life
caused
by
a
single
disaster
since
the
1979
crash
of
air
new
zealand
flight
901
,
although
it
was
surpassed
three
months
later
by
the
february
2011
christchurch
earthquake
.


In
December
2012
,
then
Prime
Minister
John
Key
said
he
would
apologise
in
person
to
the
families
of
the
deceased
,
for
the
Government
's
weak
regulations
and
inadequate
inspection
regime
.


The
Labour
Government
,
elected
in
2017
,
has
established
a
new
Pike
River
Recovery
Agency
,
with
re-entry
expected
by
March
2019
.


It
reports
to
the
Minister
Responsible
for
Pike
River
Re-entry
,
Andrew
Little
.


Re-entry
is
expected
to
cost
$
23
million
over
three
years
.


The
agency
took
over
the
mine
from
Solid
Energy
,
after
it
entered
liquidation
in
mid-March
2018
.


After
the
re-entry
,
management
of
the
mine
area
will
return
to
the
Department
of
Conservation
,
who
are
constructing
a
'Pike29
Memorial
Track
'
,
in
the
adjacent
Paparoa
National
Park

The
1957
crash
of
a
Douglas
C-47
plane
named
``
Mt
.


pinatubo
''
on
the
slopes
of
mount
unk
,
cebu
,
philippines
,
killed
the
7th
president
of
the
philippines
,
ramon
magsaysay
,
and
24
other
passengers
.


The
crash
is
estimated
to
have
occurred
at
1:40
a.m.
,
March
17
,
1957
,
Philippine
Standard
Time
(
17:40
p.m.
,
March

,
GMT
)
.


Several
high-ranking
Philippine
government
and
military
officials
,
as
well
as
journalists
,
were
also
among
the
dead
.


A
reporter
for
the
``
Philippine
Herald
''
,
Nestor
Mata
,
was
the
sole
survivor
of
the
accident
.


At
the
time
of
his
death
,
President
Magsaysay
,
a
Nacionalista
,
was
widely
popular
and
was
expected
to
easily
win
re-election
in
the
November
presidential
elections
.


On
May
12
,
2015
,
an
Amtrak
``
Northeast
Regional
''
train
from
Washington
,
D.C.
bound
for
New
York
City
derailed
and
wrecked
on
the
Northeast
Corridor
in
the
Port
Richmond
neighborhood
of
Philadelphia
,
Pennsylvania
.


Of
238
passengers
and
5
crew
on
board
,
8
were
killed
and
over
200
injured
,
11
critically
.


The
train
was
traveling
at
in
a
zone
of
curved
tracks
when
it
derailed
.


Some
of
the
passengers
had
to
be
extricated
from
the
wrecked
cars
.


Many
of
the
passengers
and
local
residents
helped
first
responders
during
the
rescue
operation
.


Five
local
hospitals
treated
the
injured
.


The
derailment
disrupted
train
service
for
several
days
.


The
National
Transportation
Safety
Board
ruled
that
the
derailment
was
caused
by
the
train
's
engineer
(
driver
)
becoming
distracted
by
other
radio
transmissions
and
losing
situational
awareness
,
and
said
that
it
would
have
been
prevented
by
positive
train
control
,
a
computerized
speed-limiting
system
that
was
operational
elsewhere
on
the
Northeast
Corridor
,
but
whose
activation
at
the
wreck
site
had
been
delayed
due
to
regulatory
requirements
.


The
track
in
question
was
also
not
equipped
with
ATC
(
automatic
train
control
)
,
an
older
and
simpler
system
that
had
been
operational
for
years
on
the
southbound
track
of
the
curve
at
which
the
derailment
occurred
,
and
that
also
would
have
limited
the
train
's
speed
entering
the
curve
.


Shortly
after
the
derailment
,
Amtrak
completed
ATC
installation
on
the
northbound
track
.


The
2015
wreck
was
the
deadliest
on
the
Northeast
Corridor
since
1987
,
when
16
people
died
in
a
wreck
near
Baltimore
.


tropical
storm
beryl
was
the
strongest
off-season
atlantic
tropical
cyclone
on
record
to
make
landfall
in
the
united
states
.


The
second
tropical
cyclone
of
the
2012
Atlantic
hurricane
season
,
Beryl
developed
on
May
26
from
a
low-pressure
system
offshore
North
Carolina
.


Initially
subtropical
,
the
storm
slowly
acquired
tropical
characteristics
as
it
tracked
across
warmer
sea
surface
temperatures
and
within
an
environment
of
decreasing
vertical
wind
shear
.


Late
on
May
27
,
Beryl
transitioned
into
a
tropical
cyclone
less
than
from
North
Florida
.


Early
the
following
day
,
the
storm
moved
ashore
near
Jacksonville
Beach
,
Florida
,
with
peak
winds
of
65
mph
(
100
km/h
)
.


It
quickly
weakened
to
a
tropical
depression
,
dropping
heavy
rainfall
while
moving
slowly
across
the
southeastern
United
States
.


A
cold
front
turned
Beryl
to
the
northeast
,
and
the
storm
became
extratropical
on
May
30
.


The
precursor
to
Beryl
produced
heavy
rainfall
in
Cuba
,
causing
flooding
,
mudslides
and
two
deaths
.


Torrential
rain
also
affected
south
Florida
and
the
Bahamas
.


After
forming
,
Beryl
produced
rough
surf
along
the
US
southeastern
coast
,
leaving
one
person
from
Folly
Beach
,
South
Carolina
missing
.


upon
making
landfall
in
florida
,
the
storm
produced
strong
winds
that
left
38,000
people
without
power
.


High
rains
alleviated
drought
conditions
and
put
out
wildfires
along
the
storm
's
path
.


A
fallen
tree
killed
a
man
driving
in
Orangeburg
County
,
South
Carolina
.


In
northeast
North
Carolina
,
Beryl
spawned
an
EF1
tornado
that
snapped
trees
and
damaged
dozens
of
homes
near
the
city
of

.


Overall
damage
was
minor
,
estimated
at
$
148,000

The
Spanish
American
wars
of
independence
were
the
numerous
wars
against
Spanish
rule
in
Spanish
America
with
the
aim
of
political
independence
that
took
place
during
the
early
19th
century
,
shortly
after
the
French
invasion
of
Spain
in
1807
during
Europe
's
Napoleonic
Wars
.


although
there
has
been
research
on
the
idea
of
a
separate
spanish
american
(
``
creole
''
)
identity
separate
from
that
of
iberia
,
political
independence
was
not
initially
the
aim
of
most
spanish
americans
,
nor
was
it
necessarily
inevitable
.


After
the
restoration
of
rule
by
Ferdinand
VII
in
1814
,
and
his
rejection
of
the
Spanish
liberal
constitution
of
1812
,
the
monarchy
as
well
as
liberals
hardened
their
stance
toward
its
overseas
possessions
,
and
they
in
turn
increasingly
sought
political
independence
.


The
violent
conflicts
started
in
1809
with
short-lived
governing
juntas
established
in
Chuquisaca
and
Quito
in
opposing
the
government
of
the
Supreme
Central
Junta
of
Seville
.


In
1810
,
numerous
new
juntas
appeared
across
the
Spanish
domains
in
the
Americas
when
the
Central
Junta
fell
to
the
French
invasion
.


although
various
regions
of
spanish
america
objected
to
many
crown
policies
,
``
there
was
little
interest
in
outright
independence
;
indeed
there
was
widespread
support
for
the
spanish
central
junta
formed
to
lead
the
resistance
against
the
french
.
''


While
some
Spanish
Americans
believed
that
independence
was
necessary
,
most
who
initially
supported
the
creation
of
the
new
governments
saw
them
as
a
means
to
preserve
the
region
's
autonomy
from
the
French
.


over
the
course
of
the
next
decade
,
the
political
instability
in
spain
and
the
absolutist
restoration
under
ferdinand
vii
convinced
many
spanish
americans
of
the
need
to
formally
establish
independence
from
the
mother
country
.


These
conflicts
were
fought
both
as
irregular
warfare
and
conventional
warfare
,
and
as
wars
of
national
liberation
and
civil
wars
.


The
conflicts
among
the
colonies
and
with
Spain
eventually
resulted
in
a
chain
of
newly
independent
countries
stretching
from
Argentina
,
Chile
,
and
Peru
in
the
south
to
Mexico
in
the
north
in
the
first
third
of
the
19th
century
.


Cuba
and
Puerto
Rico
remained
under
Spanish
rule
until
the
Spanish–American
War
in
1898
.


The
new
republics
from
the
beginning
abolished
the
formal
system
of
racial
classification
and
hierarchy
,
casta
system
,
the
Inquisition
,
and
noble
titles
.


Slavery
was
not
abolished
immediately
but
ended
in
all
of
the
new
nations
within
a
quarter
century
.


Criollos
(
those
of
Spanish
descent
born
in
the
New
World
)
and
mestizos
(
those
of
mixed
American
Indian
and
Spanish
blood
or
culture
)
replaced
Spanish-born
appointees
in
most
political
governments
.


Criollos
remained
at
the
top
of
a
social
structure
that
retained
some
of
its
traditional
features
culturally
,
if
not
legally
.


For
almost
a
century
thereafter
,
conservatives
and
liberals
fought
to
reverse
or
to
deepen
the
social
and
political
changes
unleashed
by
those
rebellions
.


The
events
in
Spanish
America
were
related
to
the
wars
of
independence
in
the
former
French
colony
of
St-Domingue
,
Haiti
,
and
the
transition
to
independence
in
Brazil
.


Brazil
's
independence
,
in
particular
,
shared
a
common
starting
point
with
that
of
Spanish
America
,
since
both
conflicts
were
triggered
by
Napoleon
's
invasion
of
the
Iberian
Peninsula
,
which
forced
the
Portuguese
royal
family
to
flee
to
Brazil
in
1807
.


the
process
of
latin
american
independence
took
place
in
the
general
political
and
intellectual
climate
that
emerged
from
the
age
of
enlightenment
and
that
influenced
all
of
the
atlantic
revolutions
,
including
the
earlier
revolutions
in
the
united
states
and
france
.


A
more
direct
cause
of
the
Spanish
American
wars
of
independence
were
the
unique
developments
occurring
within
the
Kingdom
of
Spain
and
its
monarchy
during
this
era
.


The
Battle
of
Glen
Trool
was
a
minor
engagement
in
the
First
War
of
Scottish
Independence
,
fought
in
April
1307
.


Glen
Trool
is
a
narrow
glen
in
the
Southern
Uplands
of
Galloway
,
Scotland
.


Loch
Trool
is
aligned
on
an
east-west
axis
and
is
flanked
on
both
sides
by
steep
rising
hills
,
making
it
ideal
for
an
ambush
.


The
battlefield
is
currently
under
research
to
be
inventoried
and
protected
by
Historic
Scotland
under
the
Scottish
Historical
Environment
Policy
of
2009

Robert
Bruce
had
been
crowned
King
of
Scots
after
being
involved
in
the
murder
of
John
``
the
Red
''
Comyn
,
a
leading
rival
,
and
one
of
the
most
powerful
men
in
Scotland
,
the
previous
year
1306
.


This
led
to
a
war
between
King
Robert
and
King
Edward
I
as
well
as
with
the
Comyns
and
their
allies
.


The
Return
of
King
Robert
the
Bruce
.


After
his
defeat
at
the
Battle
of
Methven
and
subsequently
,
at
the
Battle
of
Dalry
in
the
summer
of
1306
the
recently
crowned
King
Robert
was
little
better
than
a
fugitive
,
disappearing
altogether
from
the
historical
record
for
a
number
of
months
.


It
was
n't
until
the
spring
of
1307
that
he
made
a
reappearance
,
landing
in
the
south-west
of
Scotland
with
soldiers
recruited
,
for
the
most
part
,
from
the
Western
Isles
.


It
was
an
understandable
move
;
for
he
came
ashore
in
his
own
earldom
of
Carrick
,
where
he
could
expect
to
command
a
large
degree
of
local
support
.


Perhaps
even
more
important
the
countryside
itself
was
well
known
to
Bruce
,
and
there
were
plenty
of
remote
and
difficult
areas
to
allow
cover
and
protection
for
his
band
of
guerillas
.


The
English
border
was
not
far
distant
;
all
of
the
local
castles
were
strongly
held
by
Edward
's
forces
;
and
,
perhaps
most
important
of
all
,
the
Lordship
of
Galloway
,
the
old
Balliol
patrimony
,
was
adjacent
to
Carrick
,
and
many
of
the
local
families
were
hostile
to
King
Robert
the
Bruce
and
his
cause
.


When
his
brothers
Thomas
and
Alexander
attempted
a
landing
on
the
shores
of
Loch
Ryan
,
they
met
with
disaster
at
the
hands
of
Dungal
MacDougall
,
the
leading
Balliol
supporter
in
the
area
.


the
brabant
revolution
or
unk
revolution
(
,
)
,
sometimes
referred
to
as
the
belgian
revolution
of
unk
in
older
writing
,
was
an
armed
insurrection
that
occurred
in
the
austrian
netherlands
(
modern-day
belgium
)
between
october
1789
and
december
1790
.


The
revolution
,
which
occurred
at
the
same
time
as
revolutions
in
France
and
Liège
,
led
to
the
brief
overthrow
of
Habsburg
rule
and
the
proclamation
of
a
short-lived
polity
,
the
United
Belgian
States
.


The
revolution
was
the
product
of
opposition
which
emerged
to
the
liberal
reforms
of
Emperor
Joseph
II
in
the
1780s
.


These
were
perceived
as
an
attack
on
the
Catholic
Church
and
the
traditional
institutions
in
the
Austrian
Netherlands
.


Resistance
,
focused
in
the
autonomous
and
wealthy
Estates
of
Brabant
and
Flanders
,
grew
.


In
the
aftermath
of
rioting
and
disruption
in
1787
,
known
as
the
Small
Revolution
,
many
dissidents
took
refuge
in
the
neighboring
Dutch
Republic
where
they
formed
a
rebel
army
.


Soon
after
the
outbreak
of
the
French
and
Liège
revolutions
,
this
``
émigré
''
army
crossed
into
the
Austrian
Netherlands
and
decisively
defeated
the
Austrians
at
the
Battle
of
Turnhout
in
October
1789
.


The
rebels
,
supported
by
uprisings
across
the
territory
,
soon
took
control
over
virtually
all
the
Southern
Netherlands
and
proclaimed
independence
.


Despite
the
tacit
support
of
Prussia
,
the
independent
United
Belgian
States
,
established
in
January
1790
,
received
no
foreign
recognition
and
the
rebels
soon
became
divided
along
ideological
lines
.


The
Vonckists
,
led
by
Jan
Frans
Vonck
,
advocated
progressive
and
liberal
government
,
whereas
the
Statists
,
led
by
Hendrik
Van
der
Noot
,
were
staunchly
conservative
and
supported
by
the
Church
.


The
Statists
,
who
had
a
wider
base
of
support
,
soon
drove
the
Vonckists
into
exile
through
a
terror
.


By
mid-1790
,
Habsburg
Austria
ended
its
war
with
the
Ottoman
Empire
and
prepared
to
suppress
the
Brabant
revolutionaries
.


The
new
Holy
Roman
Emperor
,
Leopold
II
,
a
liberal
like
his
predecessor
,
proposed
an
amnesty
for
the
rebels
.


After
a
Statist
army
was
overcome
at
the
Battle
of
Falmagne
,
the
territory
was
quickly
overrun
by
Imperial
forces
,
and
the
revolution
was
defeated
by
December
.


The
Austrian
reestablishment
was

the
French

French
Revolutionary
Wars

because
of
its
distinctive
course
,
the
brabant
revolution
had
been
extensively
used
in
historical
comparisons
with
the
french
revolution
.


some
historians
,
following
henri
pirenne
,
have
seen
it
as
a
key
moment
in
the
formation
of
a
belgian
nation-state
,
and
an
influence
on
the
belgian
revolution
of
1830
.


the

``

)
or
independence
intifada
(
arabic

``

)
was
a
chain
of
demonstrations
in
lebanon
(
especially
in
the
capital
beirut
)
triggered
by
the
assassination
of
former
lebanese
prime
minister
,
rafik
hariri
.


The
popular
movement
was
remarkable
for
its
avoidance
of
violence
,
peaceful
approach
,
and
its
total
reliance
on
methods
of
civil
resistance
.


The
primary
goals
of
the
activists
were
the
withdrawal
of
Syrian
troops
from
Lebanon
and
the
replacement
of
a
government
heavily
influenced
by
Syrian
interests
with
more
independent
leadership
,
the
establishment
of
an
international
commission
to
investigate
the
assassination
of
Prime
Minister
Hariri
,
the
resignation
of
security
officials
to
ensure
the
success
of
the
plan
,
and
the
organization
of
free
parliamentary
elections
.


The
demonstrators
demanded
the
end
of
the
Syrian
influence
in
Lebanese
politics
.


At
the
start
of
the
demonstrations
,
Syria
had
been
maintaining
a
force
of
roughly
14,000
soldiers
and
intelligence
agents
in
Lebanon
.


Following
the
demonstrations
,
the
Syrian
troops
completely
withdrew
from
Lebanon
on
27
April
2005
.


With
the
disbanding
of
the
Pro-Syrian
government
,
the
main
goals
of
the
revolution
were
achieved
.

2014
saw
several
notable
wildfires
igniting
in
California
,
especially
during
the
month
of
May
,
when
multiple
fires
were
ablaze
concurrently
in
Southern
California
,
and
during
September
,
when
several
massive
wildfires
were
burning
in
Northern
California
.


In
the
context
of
the
2012–13
North
American
drought
(
especially
the
2011–17
California
drought
)
,
as
well
as
powerful
Santa
Ana
winds
,
weather
conditions
were
ideal
for
wildfires
.


A
total
of
7,865
wildfires
ignited
throughout
the
year
,
which
burned
at
least
of
land
.


The
wildfires
caused
a
total
of
146
injuries
and
2
fatalities
,
in
addition
to
causing
at
least
$
204.05
million
(
2014
USD
)
in
damage
.


The
season
began
unusually
early
when
a
wildfire
ignited
on
January
1
,
followed
by
6
more
fires
igniting
later
within
the
same
month
.


During
a
heat
wave
and
dry
Santa
Ana
conditions
in
May
2014
,
multiple
wildfires
broke
out
simultaneously
in
San
Diego
County
,
along
with
several
other
wildfires
elsewhere
in
California
.


By
mid-May
,
fire
officials
said
they
had
already
dealt
with
1,400
wildfires
in
California
in
2014
-
twice
the
normal
amount
for
that
time
of
year
-
and
a
spokesman
for
CAL
FIRE
described
the
conditions
as
``
unprecedented
.
''


The
May
2014
San
Diego
County
wildfires
were
estimated
to
have
caused
at
least
$
60
million
(
2014
USD
)
in
damage
.


In
late
June
to
early
August
,
another
group
of
wildfires
ignited
across
the
state
,
some
of
which
reached
over
twenty
thousand
acres
in
size
.


In
mid-September
,
the
largest
group
of
wildfires
erupted
,
with
some
wildfires
becoming
larger
than
50,000
acres
in
size
.


In
early
September
2014
,
the
Happy
Complex
Fire
became
the
largest
wildfire
of
the
season
,
eventually
topping
out
at
in
size
on
September
27
.


On
October
8
,
an
aerial
tanker
crashed
during
a
firefighting
effort
at
the
Dog
Rock
Fire
,
which
killed
the
pilot
and
sparked
a
small
wildfire
.


From
late
September
to
late
October
,
the
latest
flare-up
of
major
wildfires
were
extinguished
by
cooler
weather
and
precipitation
.


From
December
10–13
,
a
powerful
winter
storm
extinguished
the
remaining
wildfires
that
were
present
.


In
mid-December
through
late
December
,
several
more
small
wildfires
sparked
,
but
they
were
all
extinguished
by
December
31
.


In
2014
,
a
study
found
a
human
fingerprint
in
growing
California
wildfire
risks
.


The
paper
is
titled
“
Extreme
fire
season
in
California
:
A
glimpse
into
the
future
?
”
It
was
published
as
the
second
chapter
of
“
Explaining
Extreme
Events
of
2014
”
,
by
the
American
Meteorological
Society
.


The
authors
also
projected
into
the
future
,
and
the
predicted
results
showed
increases
in
the
drought
index
,
the
area
under
extreme
threat
of
fires
,
and
the
days
of
fire
danger
,
stating
that
,
``
The
increase
in
extreme
fire
risk
is
expected
within
the
coming
decade
to
exceed
that
of
natural
variability
and
this
serves
as
an
indication
that
anthropogenic
climate
warming
will
likely
play
a
significant
role
in
influence

The
2006
North
Korean
nuclear
test
was
the
detonation
of
a
nuclear
device
conducted
by
North
Korea
on
October
9
,
2006
.


On
October
3
,
2006
,
North
Korea
announced
its
intention
to
conduct
a
nuclear
test
.


The
blast
is
generally
estimated
to
have
had
an
explosive
force
of
less
than
one
kiloton
,
and
some
radioactive
output
was
detected
.


United
States
officials
suggested
the
device
may
have
been
a
nuclear
explosive
that
misfired
.


An
anonymous
official
at
the
North
Korean
Embassy
in
Beijing
told
a
South
Korean
newspaper
that
the
explosive
output
was
smaller
than
expected
.


Because
of
the
secretive
nature
of
North
Korea
and
small
yield
of
the
test
,
there
remains
some
question
as
to
whether
it
was
a
successful
test
of
an
unusually
small
device
(
which
would
have
required
sophisticated
technology
)
,
or
a
partially
failed
``
fizzle
''
or
dud
.


A
scientific
paper
later
estimated
the
yield
as
0.48
kilotons
.


It
was
reported
that
the
government
of
the
People
's
Republic
of
China
was
given
a
20-minute
advance
warning
that
the
test
was
about
to
occur
.


China
sent
an
emergency
alert
to
Washington
,
D.C.
,
through
the
U.S.
embassy
in
Beijing
at
which
time
President
George
W.
Bush
was
told
by
National
Security
Advisor
Stephen
Hadley
``
shortly
after
''
10
p.m.
(
UTC-5
)
that
a
test
was
imminent
.


The
Fall
of
Baghdad
(
11
March
1917
)
occurred
during
the
Mesopotamia
Campaign

fought
between
the
forces
of
the
British
Empire
and
the
Ottoman
Turkish
Empire
in
the
First
World
War
.


Arrival
of
General
Sir
Frederick
Stanley
Maude
.


After
the
surrender
of
the
Kut
garrison
on
29
April
1916
,
the
British
Army
in
Mesopotamia
underwent
a
major
overhaul
.


A
new
commander
,
Lieutenant
General
Sir
Frederick
Stanley
Maude
,
was
given
the
job
of
restoring
Britain
's
military
reputation
.


General
Maude
spent
the
rest
of
1916
rebuilding
his
army
.


Most
of
his
troops
were
recruited
in
India
and
then
sent
by
sea
to
Basra
.


While
these
troops
were
being
trained
,
British
military
engineers
built
a
field
railway
from
the
coast
up
to
Basra
and
beyond
.


General
Maude
also
obtained
a
small
force
of
armed
river
boats
and
river
supply
ships
.


The
British
launched
their
new
campaign
on
13
December
1916
.


the
british
had
some
50,000
well-trained
and
well-equipped
troops
:
mostly
british
india
troops
of
the
indian
expeditionary
force
d
together
with
the
13th
(
western
)
division
of
the
british
army
forming
the
mesopotamia
expeditionary
force
.


The
Indian
divisions
of
the
Indian
III
Corps
(
also
called
the
Tigris
Corps
)
included
British
Army
units
.


The
Ottoman
forces
were
smaller
,
perhaps
around
25,000
strong
under
the
overall
command
of
General
Khalil
Pasha
.


The
Upper
Canada
Rebellion
was
an
insurrection
against
the
perceived
oligarchic
government
of
the
British
colony
of
Upper
Canada
(
present-day
Ontario
)
in
December
1837
.


While
public
grievances
had
existed
for
years
,
it
was
the
rebellion
in
Lower
Canada
(
present-day
Quebec
)
that
emboldened
rebels
in
Upper
Canada
to
openly
revolt
soon
after
.


The
Upper
Canada
Rebellion
was
largely
defeated
shortly
after
it
began
,
although
resistance
lingered
until
1838
(
and
became
more
violent
)
-
mainly
through
the
support
of
the
Hunters
'
Lodges
,
a
secret
anti-British
,
US-based
militia
that
emerged
around
the
Great
Lakes
,
and
launched
the
Patriot
War
in
1838-39
.


some
historians
suggest
that
although
they
were
not
as
directly
successful
or
as
large
,
that
the
rebellions
in
1837
should
be
viewed
in
the
wider
context
of
the
late
18th
and
early
19th
century
atlantic
revolutions
including
the
american
revolutionary
war
in
1776
,
the
french
revolution
of
unk
,
the
haitian
revolution
of
unk
,
the
irish
rebellion
of
1798
,
and
the
independence
struggles
of
spanish
america
(
unk
)
.


While
these
rebellions
differed
in
that
they
also
struggled
for
republicanism
,
they
were
inspired
by
similar
social
problems
stemming
from
poorly
regulated
oligarchies
,
and
sought
the
same
democratic
ideals
,
which
were
also
shared
by
the
United
Kingdom
's
Chartists
.


The
rebellion
led
directly
to
Lord
Durham
's
Report
on
the
Affairs
of
British
North
America
,
and
to
``
The
British
North
America
Act
,
1840
''
,
which
partially
reformed
the
British
provinces
into
a
unitary
system
,
leading
to
the
formation
of
Canada
as
a
nation
in
1867
.

the
taxpayer
march
on
washington
(
also
known
as
the
9/12
tea
party
)
was
a
tea
party
protest
march
from
freedom
plaza
to
the
united
states
capitol
held
on
september
12
,
2009
,
in
washington
,
d.c
.


The
event
coincided
with
similar
protests
organized
in
various
cities
across
the
nation
.


The
protesters
rallied
against
what
they
consider
big
government
,
the
dismantling
of
free
market
capitalism
,
abortion
,
and
President
Barack
Obama
's
proposals
on
health
care
reform
,
taxation
,
and
federal
spending
,
among
other
issues
.


The
lead
organizer
of
the
event
was
Brendan
Steinhauser
,
who
was
serving
as
the
Director
of
Federal
and
State
Campaigns
for
FreedomWorks
.


organizers
of
the
event
included
the
9-12
project
,
freedomworks
,
the
national

,
the
heartland
institute
,
americans
for
tax
reform
,
tea

patriots
,
unk
and
americans
for

.


The
event
was
also
promoted
by
Fox
News
commentator
Glenn
Beck
as
a
symbol
of
what
he
called
``
national
unity
''
following
the
eight-year
anniversary
of
the
September
11
attacks
.


The
march
is
the
largest
gathering
of
fiscal
conservatives
ever
held
in
Washington
,
D.C.
,
as
well
as
the
largest
demonstration
against
President
Obama
's
administration
.


A
wide
range
of
crowd
estimates
was
suggested
for
the
event
,
with
most
media
sourcing
the
Public
Information
Officer
of
the
D.C.
Fire
Department
,
who
unofficially
estimated
the
attendance
``
in
excess
of
75,000
''
people
.


the
d.c.
fire
department
later
released
a
statement
saying
that
they
do
not
do
crowd
estimates
,
and
any
crowd
estimation
attributed
to
them
was
false
;
they
also
stated
that
an
early
estimate
of
60,000
over
twitter
was
for
a
specific
area
,
freedom
plaza
,
not
the
total
number
of
participants
in
the
event
.


Event
organizers
also
reported
a
range
of
attendance
.


FreedomWorks
suggested
between
600,000
and
800,000
participants
while
National
Taxpayers
Union
said
200,000
to
300,000
.


The
Fronde
(
)
was
a
series
of
civil
wars
in
France
between
1648
and
1653
,
occurring
in
the
midst
of
the
Franco-Spanish
War
,
which
had
begun
in
1635
.


King
Louis
XIV
confronted
the
combined
opposition
of
the
princes
,
the
nobility
,
the
law
courts
(
``
parlements
''
)
,
and
most
of
the
French
people
,
and
yet
won
out
in
the
end
.


The
dispute
started
when
the
government
of
France
issued
seven
fiscal
edicts
,
six
of
which
were
to
increase
taxation
.


The
parlements
pushed
back
and
questioned
the
constitutionality
of
the
King
's
actions
and
sought
to
check
his
powers
.


The
Fronde
was
divided
into
two
campaigns
,
the
Parlementary
Fronde
and
the
Fronde
of
the
Princes
.


The
timing
of
the
outbreak
of
the
Parlementary
Fronde
,
directly
after
the
Peace
of
Westphalia
(
1648
)
that
ended
the
Thirty
Years
'
War
,
was
significant
.


The
nuclei
of
the
armed
bands
that
terrorized
parts
of
France
under
aristocratic
leaders
during
this
period
had
been
hardened
in
a
generation
of
war
in
Germany
,
where
troops
still
tended
to
operate
autonomously
.


Louis
XIV
,
impressed
as
a
young
ruler
with
the
experience
of
the
Fronde
,
came
to
reorganize
French
fighting
forces
under
a
stricter
hierarchy
whose
leaders
ultimately
could
be
made
or
unmade
by
the
King
.


Cardinal
Mazarin
blundered
into
the
crisis
but
came
out
well
ahead
at
the
end
.


The
Fronde
represented
the
final
attempt
of
the
French
nobility
to
do
battle
with
the
king
,
and
they
were
humiliated
.


In
the
long-term
,
the
Fronde
served
to
strengthen
royal
authority
,
but
weakened
the
economy
.


The
Fronde
facilitated
the
emergence
of
absolute
monarchy
.


The
Malari
incident
(
;
,
short
for
``
Malapetaka
Lima
Belas
Januari
''
,
``
Fifteenth
of
January
Disaster
''
)
was
a
student
demonstration
and
riot
that
happened
from
15
to
16
January
1974
.


In
reaction
to
a
state
visit
by
the
Japanese
Prime
Minister
,
Kakuei
Tanaka
,
students
held
a
demonstration
protesting
corruption
,
high
prices
,
and
inequality
in
foreign
investments
.


After
provocation
by
suspected
agent
provocateurs
,
the
demonstrations
became
riots
,
which
eventually
turned
into
a
pogrom
.


By
the
end
of
the
incident
,
11
protestors
had
been
killed
and
hundreds
of
cars
and
buildings
destroyed
.


The
riots
caused
numerous

The
First
Battle
of
Ypres
(
,
was
a
battle
of
the
First
World
War
,
fought
on
the
Western
Front
around
Ypres
,
in
West
Flanders
,
Belgium
.


the
battle
was
part
of
the
first
battle
of
flanders
,
in
which
german
,
french
,
belgian
armies
and
the
british
expeditionary
force
(

)
fought
from
arras
in
france
to
nieuport
on
the
belgian
coast
,
from
10
october
to
mid-november
.


The
battles
at
Ypres
began
at
the
end
of
the
Race
to
the
Sea
,
reciprocal
attempts
by
the
German
and
Franco-British
armies
to
advance
past
the
northern
flank
of
their
opponents
.


North
of
Ypres
,
the
fighting
continued
in
the
Battle
of
the
Yser
between
the
German
4th
Army
,
the
Belgian
army
and
French
marines
.


The
fighting
has
been
divided
into
five
stages
,
an
encounter
battle
from
19
to
21
October
,
the
Battle
of
Langemarck
from
21
to
24
October
,
the
battles
at
La
Bassée
and
Armentières
to
2
November
,
coincident
with
more
Allied
attacks
at
Ypres
and
the
Battle
of
Gheluvelt
a
fourth
phase
with
the
last
big
German
offensive
,
which
culminated
at
the
Battle
of
Nonne
Bosschen
on
11
November
,
then
local
operations
which
faded
out
in
late
November
.


Brigadier-General
James
Edmonds
,
the
British
official
historian
,
wrote
in
the
History
of
the
Great
War
,
that
the
II
Corps
battle
at
La
Bassée
could
be
taken
as
separate
but
that
the
battles
from
Armentières
to
Messines
and
Ypres
,
were
better
understood
as
one
battle
in
two
parts
,
an
offensive
by
III
Corps
and
the
Cavalry
Corps
from
12
to
18
October
against
which
the
Germans
retired
and
an
offensive
by
the
German
6th
Army
and
4th
Army
from
19
October
to
2
November
,
which
from
30
October
,
took
place
mainly
north
of
the
Lys
,
when
the
battles
of
Armentières
and
Messines
merged
with
the
Battles
of
Ypres
.


Attacks
by
the
BEF
(
Field
Marshal
Sir
John
French
)
the
Belgians
and
the
French
Eighth
Army
in
Belgium
made
little
progress
beyond
Ypres
.


The
German
4th
and
6th
Armies
took
small
amounts
of
ground
at
great
cost
to
both
sides
,
during
the
Battle
of
the
Yser
and
further
south
at
Ypres
.

erich
von
falkenhayn

of

,
then
tried
a
limited
offensive
to
capture
ypres
and
mont
kemmel
,
from
19
october
to
22
november
.


Neither
side
had
moved
forces
to
Flanders
fast
enough
to
obtain
a
decisive
victory
and
by
November
both
sides
were
exhausted
.


The
armies
were
short
of
ammunition
,
suffering
from
low
morale
and
some
infantry
units
refused
orders
.


The
autumn
battles
in
Flanders
had
become
static
,
attrition
operations
,
unlike
the
battles
of
manoeuvre
in
the
summer
.


French
,
British
and
Belgian
troops
in
improvised
field
defences
,
repulsed
German
attacks
for
four
weeks
.


From
21
to
23
October
,
German
reservists
had
made
mass
attacks
at
Langemarck
,
with
losses
of
up
to
to
little
effect
.


warfare
between
mass
armies
,
equipped
with
the
weapons
of
the
industrial
revolution
and
its
later
developments
,
proved
to
be
indecisive
,
because
field
fortifications
neutralised
many
classes
of
offensive
weapon
.


The
defensive
use
of
artillery
and
machine
guns
,
dominated
the
battlefield
and
the
ability
of
the
armies
to
supply
themselves
and
replace
casualties
prolonged
battles
for
weeks
.


Thirty-four
German
divisions
fought
in
the
Flanders
battles
,
against
twelve
French
,
nine
British
and
six
Belgian
,
along
with
marines
and
dismounted
cavalry
.


Falkenhayn
reconsidered
German
strategy
over
the
winter
,
because
and
a
dictated
peace
against
France
and
Russia
had
been
shown
to
be
beyond
German
resources
.


Falkenhayn
intended
to
detach
Russia
or
France
from
the
Allied
coalition
by
diplomatic
as
well
as
military
action
.


A
strategy
of
attrition
(
)
would
make
the
cost
of
the
war
too
great
for
the
Allies
,
until
one
made
a
separate
peace
.


The
remaining
belligerents
would
have
to
negotiate
or
face
the
Germans
concentrated
on
the
remaining
front
,
which
would
be
sufficient
to
obtain
a
decisive
victory
.


The
Yom
Kippur
War
,
Ramadan
War
,
or
October
War
(
,
'
,
or
מלחמת
יום
כיפור
''
,
``
;
,
'
,
or
,
'
)
,
also
known
as
the
1973
Arab–Israeli
War
,
was
a
war
fought
from
October
6
to
25
,
1973
,
by
a
coalition
of
Arab
states
led
by
Egypt
and
Syria
against
Israel
.


The
war
took
place
mostly
in
Sinai
and
the
Golan—occupied
by
Israel
during
the
1967
Six-Day
War—with
some
fighting
in
African
Egypt
and
northern
Israel
.


Egypt
's
initial
war
objective
was
to
use
its
military
to
seize
a
foothold
on
the
east
bank
of
the
Suez
Canal
and
use
this
to
negotiate
the
return
of
the
rest
of
Sinai
.


The
war
began
when
the
Arab
coalition
launched
a
joint
surprise
attack
on
Israeli
positions
,
on
Yom
Kippur
,
the
holiest
day
in
Judaism
,
which
also
occurred
that
year
during
the
Muslim
holy
month
of
Ramadan
.


Egyptian
and
Syrian
forces
crossed
ceasefire
lines
to
enter
the
Sinai
Peninsula
and
the
Golan
Heights
,
respectively
.


Both
the
United
States
and
the
Soviet
Union
initiated
massive
resupply
efforts
to
their
respective
allies
during
the
war
,
and
this
led
to
a
near-confrontation
between
the
two
nuclear
superpowers
.


The
war
began
with
a
massive
and
successful
Egyptian
crossing
of
the
Suez
Canal
.


Egyptian
forces
crossed
the
cease-fire
lines
,
then
advanced
virtually
unopposed
into
the
Sinai
Peninsula
.


After
three
days
,
Israel
had
mobilized
most
of
its
forces
and
halted
the
Egyptian
offensive
,
resulting
in
a
military
stalemate
.


The
Syrians
coordinated
their
attack
on
the
Golan
Heights
to
coincide
with
the
Egyptian
offensive
and
initially
made
threatening
gains
into
Israeli-held
territory
.


Within
three
days
,
however
,
Israeli
forces
had
pushed
the
Syrians
back
to
the
pre-war
ceasefire
lines
.


the
israel
defense
forces
(
idf
)
then
launched
a
four-day
counter-offensive
deep
into
syria
.


Within
a
week
,
Israeli
artillery
began
to
shell
the
outskirts
of
Damascus
,
and
Egyptian
President
Sadat
began
to
worry
about
the
integrity
of
his
major
ally
.


He
believed
that
capturing
two
strategic
passes
located
deeper
in
the
Sinai
would
make
his
position
stronger
during
post-war
negotiations
;
he
therefore
ordered
the
Egyptians
to
go
back
on
the
offensive
,
but
their
attack
was
quickly
repulsed
.


The
Israelis
then
counter-attacked
at
the
seam
between
the
two
Egyptian
armies
,
crossed
the
Suez
Canal
into
Egypt
,
and
began
slowly
advancing
southward
and
westward
towards
the
city
of
Suez
in
over
a
week
of
heavy
fighting
that
resulted
in
heavy
casualties
on
both
sides
.


On
October
22
,
a
United
Nations–brokered
ceasefire
unraveled
,
with
each
side
blaming
the
other
for
the
breach
.


By
October
24
,
the
Israelis
had
improved
their
positions
considerably
and
completed
their
encirclement
of
Egypt
's
Third
Army
and
the
city
of
Suez
.


This
development
led
to
tensions
between
the
United
States
and
the
Soviet
Union
,
and
a
second
ceasefire
was
imposed
cooperatively
on
October
25
to
end
the
war
.


The
war
had
far-reaching
implications
.


The
Arab
world
had
experienced
humiliation
in
the
lopsided
rout
of
the
Egyptian–Syrian–Jordanian
alliance
in
the
Six-Day
War
but
felt
psychologically
vindicated
by
early
successes
in
this
conflict
.


The
war
led
Israel
to
recognize
that
,
despite
impressive
operational
and
tactical
achievements
on
the
battlefield
,
there
was
no
guarantee
that
they
would
always
dominate
the
Arab
states
militarily
,
as
they
had
consistently
through
the
earlier
1948
Arab–Israeli
War
,
the
Suez
Crisis
,
and
the
Six-Day
War
.


These
changes
paved
the
way
for
the
subsequent
peace
process
.


The
1978
Camp
David
Accords
that
followed
led
to
the
return
of
the
Sinai
to
Egypt
and
normalized
relations—the
first
peaceful
recognition
of
Israel
by
an
Arab
country
.


Egypt
continued
its
drift
away
from
the
Soviet
Union
and
eventually
left
the
Soviet
sphere
of
influence
entirely
.


The
Charge
of
the
Light
Brigade
was
a
failed
military
action
involving
the
British
light
cavalry
led
by
Lord
Cardigan
against
Russian
forces
during
the
Battle
of
Balaclava
on
25
October
1854
in
the
Crimean
War
.


British
commander
Lord
Raglan
had
intended
to
send
the
Light
Brigade
to
prevent
the
Russians
from
removing
captured
guns
from
overrun
Turkish
positions
,
a
task
for
which
the
light
cavalry
were
well-suited
.


However
,
there
was
miscommunication
in
the
chain
of
command
,
and
the
Light
Brigade
was
instead
sent
on
a
frontal
assault
against
a
different
artillery
battery
,
one
well-prepared
with
excellent
fields
of
defensive
fire
.


The
Light
Brigade
reached
the
battery
under
withering
direct
fire
and
scattered
some
of
the
gunners
,
but
they
were
forced
to
retreat
immediately
,
and
the
assault
ended
with
very
high
British
casualties
and
no
decisive
gains
.


The
events
were
the
subject
of
Alfred
,
Lord
Tennyson
's
narrative
poem
``
The
Charge
of
the
Light
Brigade
''
(
1854
)
,
published
just
six
weeks
after
the
event
.


Its
lines
emphasise
the
valour
of
the
cavalry
in
bravely
carrying
out
their
orders
,
regardless
of
the
nearly
inevitable
outcome
.


Responsibility
for
the
miscommunication
has
remained
controversial
,
as
the
order
was
vague
and
Louis
Edward
Nolan
delivered
the
written
orders
with
some
verbal
interpretation
,
then
died
in
the
first
minute
of
the
assault
.


Cyclone
Kamisy
was
considered
the
worst
tropical
cyclone
to
affect
northern
Madagascar
since
1911
.


A
tropical
disturbance
formed
near
Diego
Garcia
on
April
3
,
1984
and
subsequently
moved
westward
,
intensifying
into
a
moderate
tropical
storm
two
days
later
.


Given
the
name
Kamisy
,
the
storm
gradually
intensified
into
an
intense
tropical
cyclone
by
April
9
.


Kamisy
reached
winds
of
170
km/h
(
105
mph
)
before
making
landfall
in
extreme
northern
Madagascar
near
Diego
Suarez
.


It
weakened
upon
entering
the
Mozambique
Channel
,
but
briefly
re-intensified
on
April
10
.


That
day
while
passing
near
Mayotte
,
the
cyclone
turned
to
the
southeast
,
striking
Madagascar
again
near
Majunga
.


Kamisy
quickly
crossed
the
country
.


After
emerging
into
the
Indian
Ocean
off
the
east
coast
of
Madagascar
,
the
system
reintensified
into
a
moderate
tropical
storm
before
dissipating
on
April
16
.


In
northern
Madagascar
,
Kamisy
produced
wind
gusts
of
,
which
destroyed
80
%
of
the
city
of
Diego
Suarez
.


About
39,000
people
were
left
homeless
in
the
area
,
and
there
were
five
deaths
.


In
western
Madagascar
,
the
cyclone
dropped
of
rainfall
in
24
hours
in
Majunga
,
which
damaged
rice
fields
in
the
region
after
causing
widespread
river
flooding
.


Additionally
,
the
storm
destroyed
about
80
%
of
Majunga
.


Throughout
the
country
,
Kamisy
caused
$
250
million
in
damage
and
68
deaths
,
with
215
people
injured
and
100,000
left
homeless
.


Fifteen
people
were
killed
and
30
others
were
injured
in
Mahajanga
.


Following
the
storm
,
emergency
food
and
medical
supplies
were
rushed
into
the
nation
.


In
addition
to
the
impact
to
Madagascar
,
one
death
and
severe
damage
was
reported
in
the
Comoros
Islands
,
where
all
of
the
banana
crop
was
destroyed
.


Braathens
SAFE
Flight
253
,
also
known
as
the
Hummelfjell
Accident
(
)
,
occurred
on
7
November
1956
at
9:50
,
when
a
de
Havilland
Heron
crashed
into
the
mountain
Hummelfjell
in
Tolga
,
Norway
.


The
Braathens
SAFE
aircraft
was
en
route
from
Trondheim
Airport
,
Værnes
to
Oslo
Airport
,
Fornebu
.


While
passing
Røros
the
Heron
started
experiencing
a
rapidly
accelerating
atmospheric
icing
which
soon
was
too
extensive
for
the
ice
protection
system
to
handle
.


Combined
with
downdraft
,
the
aircraft
lost
sufficient
lift
to
stay
airborne
.


The
pilots
were
able
to
turn
around
the
aircraft
,
but
it
hit
Hummelfjell
at
an
altitude
of
above
mean
sea
level
.


The
aircraft
's
captain
was
killed
in
the
impact
and
a
passenger
died
shortly
afterwards
.


Ten
people
survived
the
crash
,
which
was
the
first
fatal
accident
of
Braathens
SAFE
.


Amongst
the
survivors
was
Rolf
Kirkvaag
,
at
the
time
Norway
's
most
popular
radio
host
.


The
search
and
rescue
operation
was
severely
hindered
by
a
blizzard
and
poor
visibility
.


Kirkvaag
and
another
person
left
the
plane
after
a
day
and
met
a
rescue
party
.


The
investigation
concluded
that
there
were
neither
technical
faults
with
the
aircraft
nor
pilot
error
,
and
that
it
was
not
possible
to
predict
the
weather
conditions
which
caused
the
icing
.


The
Unforgiving
World
Tour
was
a
concert
tour
by
Dutch
symphonic
metal
band
Within
Temptation
in
support
of
their
fifth
studio
album
,
``
The
Unforgiving
''
,
released
by
Roadrunner
Records
on
25
March
2011
.


It
was
their
seventh
major
tour
and
their
second
to
see
them
playing
worldwide
.


The
tour
commenced
on
10
August
2011
,
at
the
Sziget
Festival
,
Hungary
,
and
finished
on
8
September
2013
,
at
the
Rock
'
n
Coke
Festival
,
in
Turkey
,
passing
mainly
over
Europe
,
with
selected
concerts
on
North
America
and
South
America
.


The
tour
helped
on
solidifying
the
band
as
one
of
mainland
Europe
's
most
successful
symphonic
metal
acts
,
as
the
it
marked
a
major
transition
from
club
and
theater
to
arena
concerts
on
the
continent
than
the
previous
one
.


On
the
North
and
South
American
concerts
,
however
,
the
band
still
opted
to
play
at
smaller
capacity
venues
.


For
the
band
's
fifteenth
anniversary
,
they
held
their
biggest
concert
to
date
with
a
special
presentation
at
the
Sportpaleis
,
Belgium
,
featuring
some
of
the
band
's
ex-members
on
older
songs
and
other
special
guests
.


the
concert
was
later
released
as

The
1949
Florida
hurricane
caused
significant
damage
in
the
southern
portions
of
the
state
late
in
the
month
of
August
.


The
second
recorded
tropical
cyclone
of
the
annual
hurricane
season
,
the
system
originated
from
a
tropical
wave
near
the
northern
Leeward
Islands
on
August
23
.


Already
a
tropical
storm
upon
initial
observations
,
the
cyclone
curved
west-northwestward
and
intensified
,
becoming
a
hurricane
on
August
25
.


Rapid
intensification
ensued
as
the
storm
approached
the
central
Bahamas
early
on
August
26
,
with
the
storm
reaching
Category
4
hurricane
strength
later
that
day
and
peaking
with
maximum
sustained
winds
of
130
mph
(
215
km/h
)
shortly
after
striking
Andros
.


Late
on
August
26
,
the
storm
made
landfall
near
Lake
Worth
,
Florida
,
at
the
same
intensity
.


The
cyclone
initially
weakened
quickly
after
moving
inland
,
falling
to
Category
1
status
early
the
next
day
.


Shortly
thereafter
,
the
system
curved
northward
over
the
Nature
Coast
and

The
Shifta
War
(
1963–1967
)
was
a
secessionist
conflict
in
which
ethnic
Somalis
in
the
Northern
Frontier
District
(
NFD
)
of
Kenya
(
a
region
that
is
and
has
historically
been
almost
exclusively
inhabited
by
ethnic
Somalis
)
attempted
to
secede
from
Kenya
join
with
their
fellow
Somalis
in
a
Greater
Somalia
.


The
Kenyan
government
named
the
conflict
``
shifta
''
,
after
the
Somali
word
for
``
bandit
''
,
as
part
of
a
propaganda
effort
.


the
kenyan
counter-insurgency
general
service
units
forced
civilians
into
``
protected
villages
''
(
essentially
concentration
camps
)
as
well
as
killing
many
livestock
kept
by
the
pastoralist
somalis
.


the
war
ended
in
1967
when
muhammad
haji
ibrahim
egal
,
prime
minister
of
the
somali
republic
,
signed
a
ceasefire
with
kenya
at
the
arusha
conference
on
october
23
,
1967
.


However
,
the
violence
in
Kenya
deteriorated
into
disorganised
banditry
,
with
occasional
episodes
of
secessionist
agitation
,
for
the
next
several
decades
.


The
war
and
violent
clampdowns
by
the
Kenyan
government
caused
large-scale
disruption
to
the
way
of
life
in
the
district
,
resulting
in
a
slight
shift
from
pastoralist
and
transhumant
lifestyles
to
sedentary
,
urban
lifestyles
.


Government
records
put
the
official
death
toll
in
the
thousands
but
NGO
's
say
more
than
10,000
lives
were
lost
.


Hurricane
Andrew
was
a
powerful
and
destructive
Category
5
Atlantic
hurricane
that
struck
the
Bahamas
,
Florida
,
and
Louisiana
in
August
1992
.


It
is
the
most
destructive
hurricane
to
ever
hit
Florida/Bahamas
in
terms
of
structures
damaged
or
destroyed
,
and
was
the
costliest
in
financial
terms
until
Hurricane
Dorian
surpassed
it
27
years
later
.


It
was
the
strongest
landfalling
hurricane
in
decades
and
the
costliest
hurricane
to
make
landfall
anywhere
in
the
United
States
,
until
it
was
surpassed
by
Katrina
in
2005
.


Andrew
caused
major
damage
in
the
Bahamas
and
Louisiana
,
but
the
greatest
impact
was
felt
in
South
Florida
,
where
the
storm
made
landfall
as
a
Category
5
hurricane
,
with
1-minute
sustained
wind
speeds
as
high
as
165
mph
(
266
km/h
)
.


Passing
directly
through
the
city
of
Homestead
in
Dade
County
(
now
known
as
Miami-Dade
County
)
,
Andrew
stripped
many
homes
of
all
but
their
concrete
foundations
.


In
total
,
Andrew
destroyed
more
than
63,500
houses
,
damaged
more
than
124,000
others
,
caused
$
27.3
billion
in
damage
,
and
left
65
people
dead
.


Andrew
began
as
a
tropical
depression
over
the
eastern
Atlantic
Ocean
on
August
16
.


After
spending
a
week
without
significantly
strengthening
itself
in
the
central
Atlantic
,
it
rapidly
intensified
into
a
powerful
Category
5
hurricane
while
moving
westward
towards
the
Bahamas
on
August
23
.


though
it
briefly
weakened
to
category
4
status
while
traversing
the
bahamas
,
it
regained
category
5
intensity
before
making
landfall
in
florida
on
elliott
key
and
then
homestead
on
august
24
.


With
a
barometric
pressure
of
922
mbar
(
27.23
inHg
)
at
the
time
of
landfall
in
Florida
,
Andrew
is
the
sixth
most-intense
hurricane
to
strike
the
United
States
.


Several
hours
later
,
the
hurricane
emerged
over
the
Gulf
of
Mexico
at
Category
4
strength
,
with
the
Gulf
Coast
of
the
United
States
in
its
dangerous
path
.


After
turning
northwestward
and
weakening
further
,
Andrew
moved
ashore
near
Morgan
City
,
Louisiana
,
as
a
low-end
Category
3
storm
.


After
moving
inland
,
the
small
hurricane
curved
northeastward
and
rapidly
lost
its
intensity
,
merging
with
a
frontal
system
over
the
southern
Appalachian
Mountains
on
August
29
.


Hurricane
Andrew
first
inflicted
structural
damage
as
it
moved
through
the
Bahamas
,
especially
in
Cat
Cays
,
lashing
the
islands
with
storm
surge
,
hurricane-force
winds
,
and
tornadoes
.


About
800
houses
were
destroyed
in
the
archipelago
,
and
there
was
substantial
damage
to
the
transport
,
water
,
sanitation
,
agriculture
,
and
fishing
sectors
.


Andrew
left
four
dead
and
$
250
million
in
damage
throughout
the
Bahamas
.


In
parts
of
southern
Florida
,
Andrew
produced
severe
winds
;
a
wind
gust
of
177
mph
(
282
km/h
)
was
observed
at
a
house
in
Perrine
.


The
cities
of
Florida
City
,
Homestead
,
and
Cutler
Ridge
received
the
brunt
of
the
storm
.


As
many
as
1.4
million
people
lost
power
at
the
height
of
the
storm
.


In
the
Everglades
,
70,000
acres
(
280
km
)
of
trees
were
downed
,
while
invasive
Burmese
pythons
began
inhabiting
the
region
after
a
nearby
facility
housing
them
was
destroyed
.


Rainfall
in
Florida
was
substantial
,
peaking
at
13.98
inches
(
355
mm
)
in
western
Dade
County
.


In
Florida
,
Andrew
killed
44
and
left
a
record
$
25
billion
in
damage
.


Prior
to
making
landfall
in
Louisiana
on
August
26
,
Andrew
caused
extensive
damage
to
oil
platforms
in
the
Gulf
of
Mexico
,
leading
to
$
500
million
in
losses
for
oil
companies
.


It
produced
hurricane-force
winds
along
its
path
through
Louisiana
,
damaging
large
stretches
of
power
lines
that
left
about
230,000
people
without
electricity
.


over
80
%
of
trees
in
the
atchafalaya
river
basin
were
downed
,
and
the
agriculture
there
was
devastated
.


Throughout
the
basin
and
Bayou
Lafourche
,
187
million
freshwater
fish
were
killed
in
the
hurricane
.


With
23,000
houses
damaged
,
985
others
destroyed
,
and
1,951
mobile
homes
demolished
,
property
losses
in
Louisiana
exceeded
$
1.5
billion
.


The
hurricane
caused
the
deaths
of
17
people
in
the
state
,
6
of
whom
drowned
offshore
.


Andrew
spawned
at
least
28
tornadoes
along
the
Gulf
Coast
,
especially
in
Alabama
,
Georgia
,
and
Mississippi
.


In
total
,
Andrew
left
65
dead
and
caused
$
27.3
billion
in
damage
.


It
is
currently
the
seventh-costliest
Atlantic
hurricane
to
hit
the
United
States
,
behind
only
Katrina
(
2005
)
,
Ike
(
2008
)
,
Sandy
(

,
Harvey
(
2017

,
Dorian
(

,
as
well
as
the
eighth-costliest
Atlantic
hurricane
,
behind
the
aforementioned
systems
and
Wilma
(
2005
)
.


It
is
the
third-strongest
hurricane
to

The
Third
Battle
of
Seoul
,
also
known
as
the
Chinese
New

's
Offensive
,
the
January–Fourth
Retreat
(
)
or
the
Third
Phase
Campaign
Western
Sector
(
)
,
was
a
battle
of
the
Korean
War
,
which
took
place
from
December
31
,
1950
,
to
January
7
,
1951
,
around
the
South
Korean
capital
of
Seoul
.


In
the
aftermath
of
the
major
Chinese
People
's
Volunteer
Army
(
PVA
)
victory
at
the
Battle
of
the
Ch'ongch'on
River
,
the
United
Nations
Command
(
UN
)
started
to
contemplate
the
possibility
of
evacuation
from
the
Korean
Peninsula
.


China
's
Chairman
Mao
Zedong
ordered
the
Chinese
People
's
Volunteer
Army
to
cross
the
38th
Parallel
in
an
effort
to
pressure
the
UN
forces
to
withdraw
from
South
Korea
.


On
December

To
prevent
the

forces
from
overwhelming
the
defenders
,
the
US
Eighth
Army
now
under
the
command
of
Lieutenant
General
Matthew
B.
Ridgway
evacuated
Seoul
on
January
3
,
1951
.


although
pva
forces
captured
seoul
by
the
end
of
the
battle
,
the
chinese
invasion
of
south
korea
galvanized
the
un
support
for
south
korea
,
while
the
idea
of
evacuation
was
soon
abandoned
by
the
un
command
.


at
the
same
time
,
the
pva
were
exhausted
after
months
of
nonstop
fighting
since
the
start
of
the
chinese
intervention
,
thereby
allowing
the

forces
to
regain

The
1874
FA
Cup
final
was
a
football
match
between
Oxford
University
and
Royal
Engineers
on
14
March
1874
at
Kennington
Oval
in
London
.


It
was
the
third
final
of
the
world
's
oldest
football
competition
,
the
Football
Association
Challenge
Cup
(
known
in
the
modern
era
as
the
FA
Cup
)
.


Both
teams
had
previously
reached
the
final
but
been
defeated
by
Wanderers
.


The
Engineers
had
reached
the
final
with
comparative
ease
,
scoring
sixteen
goals
and
conceding
only
one
in
the
four
previous
rounds
.


Oxford
's
opponents
in
the
earlier
rounds
had
included
two-time
former
winners
Wanderers
.


The
final
was
decided
by
two
goals
from
Oxford
in
the
first
twenty
minutes
.


Their
opponents
had
spent
two
weeks
training
for
the
match
,
an
innovative
concept
at
the
time
,
but
were
repeatedly
thwarted
by
Charles
Nepean
,
the
Oxford
goalkeeper
.


The

the
british
empire
economic
conference
(
also
known
as
the
imperial
economic
conference
or
ottawa
conference
)
was
a
1932
conference
of
british
colonies
and
the
autonomous
dominions
held
to
discuss
the
great
depression
.


It
was
held
between
21
July
and
20
August
in
Ottawa
.


The
conference
saw
the
group
admit
the
failure
of
the
gold
standard
and
abandon
attempts
to
return
to
it
.


The
meeting
also
worked
to
establish
a
zone
of
limited
tariffs
within
the
British
Empire
,
but
with
high
tariffs
with
the
rest
of
the
world
.


This
was
called
``
Imperial
preference
''
or
``
Empire
Free-Trade
''
on
the
principle
of
``
home
producers
first
,
empire
producers
second
,
and
foreign
producers
last
''
.


The
result
of
the
conference
was
a
series
of
bilateral
agreements
that
would
last
for
at
least
5
years
.


This
abandonment
of
open
free
trade
led
to
a
split
in
the
British
National
Government
coalition
:
the
Official
Liberals
under
Herbert
Samuel
left
the
Government
,
but
the
National
Liberals
under
Sir
John
Simon
remained
.


The
conference
was
especially
notable
for
its
adoption
of
Keynesian
ideas
such
as
lowering
interest
rates
,
increasing
the
money
supply
,
and
expanding
government
spending
.


The
United
States
were
annoyed
by
the
implementation
of
Imperial
Preference
as
it
affected
them
economically
.


It
was
the
last
Imperial
Conference
that
any
Irish
government
participated
in
,
and
also
the
last
that
Newfoundland
attended
as
an
independent
Dominion

;
in
the
final
of
the

This
was
the
first
official
meeting
between
both
clubs
in
European
football
.


Milan
's
preparations
for
the
Super
Cup
were
blighted
by
the
death
of
Vincenzo
Spagnolo
,
a
Genoa
supporter
who
was
stabbed
on
his
way
to
watch
the
two
teams
play
.


Once
news
of
his
death
had
arrived
,
the
match
was
abandoned
and
the
Italian
football
calendar
was
suspended
for
a
week
.


Milan
and
Arsenal
paid
respect
to
Spagnolo
by
observing
a
minute
's
silence
before
the
first
leg
.


A
crowd
of
38,044
witnessed
both
clubs
play
out
a
goalless
draw
at
Highbury
;
the
first
leg
marked
the
return
of
Paul
Merson
,
who
spent
time
away
from
football
in
order
to
seek
treatment
for
various
addictions
.


A
significantly
lower
crowd
at
the
San

The
Action
of
13
March
1806
was
a
naval
engagement
of
the
Napoleonic
Wars
,
fought
when
a
British
and
a
French
squadron
met
unexpectedly
in
the
mid-Atlantic
.


Neither
force
was
aware
of
the
presence
of
the
other
prior
to
the
encounter
and
were
participating
in
separate
campaigns
.


The
British
squadron
consisted
of
seven
ships
of
the
line
accompanied
by
associated
frigates
,
led
by
Rear-Admiral
Sir
John
Borlase
Warren
,

tasked
with
hunting
down
and
destroying
the
French
squadron
of
Contre-Admiral
Jean-Baptiste
Willaumez
,
which
had
departed
Brest
for
raiding
operations
in
the
South
Atlantic
in
December
1805
,
at
the
start
of
the
Atlantic
campaign
of
1806
.


The
French
force
consisted
of
one
ship
of
the
line
and
one
frigate
,
all
that
remained
of
Contre-Admiral
Charles-Alexandre
Durand
Linois
'
squadron
that
had
sailed
for
the
Indian
Ocean
in
March
1803
during
the
Peace
of
Amiens
.


Linois
raided
British
shipping
lanes
and
harbours
across
the
region
,
achieving
limited
success
against
undefended
merchant
ships
but
repeatedly
withdrawing
in
the
face
of
determined
opposition
,
most
notably
at
the
Battle
of
Pulo
Aura
in
February
1804
.


with
his
stores
almost
exhausted
and
the
french
ports
east
of
the
cape
of
good
hope
that
could
have
offered
him
replenishment
eliminated
,
linois
decided
to
return
to
france
in
january
1806
,
and
by
march
was
inadvertently
sailing
across
the
cruising
ground
of
warren
's
squadron
.


Linois
had
twice
failed
to
capture
,
or
even
seriously
engage
,
large
and
valuable
British
merchant
convoys
on
his
cruise
.


When
he
saw
scattered
sails
in
the
distance
at
03:00
on
13
March
1806
,
he
decided
to
investigate
in
his
ship
of
the
line
``
Marengo
''
,
in
the
hope
that
the
ships
would
again
prove
to
be
a
merchant
convoy
.


By
the
time
he
realised
that
the
approaching
ships
were
actually
a
powerful
naval
squadron
,
he
was
too
close
to
outrun
the
lead
ship
,
Warren
's
flagship
HMS
``
London
''
.


As
``
London
''
engaged
``
Marengo
''
,
the
French
frigate
``
Belle
Poule
''
attempted
to
escape
from
the
approaching
squadron
independently
,
but
was
also
run
down
and
brought
to
battle
by
the
British
frigate
HMS
``
Amazon
''
.


Both
engagements
lasted
over
three
hours
and
were
bloody
,
the
French
ships
surrendering
after
three
and
a
half
hours
and
losing
nearly
70
men
between
them
.


The
battle
marked
the
end
of
Linois
's
three-year
campaign
against
British
trade
and
was
the
second
British
victory
of
the
Atlantic
campaign
,
following
the
Battle
of
San
Domingo
the
previous
month
.


Willaumez
eventually
returned
to
France
,
although
without
many
of
his
squadron
who
were
destroyed
by
British
operations
or
Atlantic
gales
.


Linois
,
despite
the
criticism
levelled
at
him
for
his
failures
in
the
Indian
Ocean
,
was
considered
to
have
fought
hard
and
been
unlucky
to
have
encountered
such
an
overwhelming
force
.


Made
a
prisoner
of
war
,
Linois
was
not
exchanged
by
Napoleon
,
who
criticised
his
behaviour
during
the
campaign
and
refused
to
employ
him
at
sea
again
.


The
battle
of
Hamath
,
sometimes
called
The
battle
of
Hama
,
was
a
battle
between
the
Babylonians
and
the
fleeing
remains
of
the
Egyptian
army
defeated
at
Carchemish
.


It
was
fought
near
the
ancient
city
Hamath
on
the
Orontes
.


In
this
battle
Nebuchadrezzar
further
shattered
the
remains
of
Necho
II
's
Egyptian
army
that
he
had
previously
defeated
in
the
Battle
of
Carchemish
.


The
battle
is
mentioned
in
the
Babylonian
Chronicles
,
now
housed
in
the
British
Museum
.


In
the
Chronicles
it
states
that
Nebuchadrezzar
II
killed
almost
all
of
the
Egyptian
combatants
,
so
exhausted
that
none
of
them
returned
to
their
own
country
.


The
Chronicles
do
not
mention
Necho
and
the
Bible
only
mentions
'Necho
's
army
'
,
and
it
is
possible
that
Necho
was
n't
present
and
the
Egyptian
army
was
just
a
garrison
army
.


He
was
dealing
with
various
rebellions
in
the
delta
.


The
Winchburgh
rail
crash
occurred
on
Monday
13
October
1862
,
northwest
of
Winchburgh
in
Linlithgowshire
(
now
West
Lothian
)
.


at
that
point
,
the
edinburgh
and
glasgow
railway
passes
through
a
cutting
on
a
curve
.


On
the
day
of
the
accident
,
only
one
line
was
in
use
due
to
track
maintenance
when
two
trains
met
head-on
.


The
drivers
saw
each
other
when
they
were
some
apart
and
managed
to
slow
down
so
that
their
relative
speed
was
under
when
they
collided
.


The
driver
of
the
Glasgow
train
leapt
clear
prior
to
the
impact
and
survived
though
badly
injured
,
but
both
firemen
and
the
driver
of
the
other
train
along
with
15
passengers
were
killed
and
35
injured
.


one
of
the
passengers
made
their
way
to
a
local
home
named
unk
house
and
commandeered
a
horse
and
cart
to
drive
over
to
linlithgow
,
raise
the
alarm
and
summon
doctors
to
the
scene
.


A
special
train
arrived
from
Edinburgh
bringing
workmen
who
laboured
all
night
to
free
the
dead
and
injured
,
and
then
to
clear
the
wreckage
;
indeed
the
line
was
back
in
use
the
following
day
.


To
prevent
such
collisions
,
the
line
was
being
worked
by
a
pilot
engine
to
escort
every
train
through
the
length
of
single
track
.


However
,
the
pilot
engine
was
being
used
for
other
duties
and
had
waggons
attached
to
it
;
moreover
the
distinctive
small
engine
had
been
substituted
for
a
larger
one
.


The
inexperienced
pointsman
saw
a
ballast
train
following
the
train
from
Glasgow
and
wrongly
assumed
it
to
be
the
pilot
engine
and
so
let
the
train
through
;
just
then
,
the
Edinburgh
train
was
approaching
from
the
east
.


The
Defence
of
the
Reich
(
)
is
the
name
given
to
the
strategic
defensive
aerial
campaign
fought
by
the
``
Luftwaffe
''
over
German-occupied
Europe
and
Nazi
Germany
during
World
War
II
.


Its
aim
was
to
prevent
the
destruction
of
German
civilians
,
military
and
civil
industries
by
the
Western
Allies
.


The
day
and
night
air
battles
over
Germany
during
the
war
involved
thousands
of
aircraft
,
units
and
aerial
engagements
to
counter
the
Allied
strategic
bombing
campaign
.


The
campaign
was
one
of
the
longest
in
the
history
of
aerial
warfare
and
with
the
Battle
of
the
Atlantic
and
the
Allied
Blockade
of
Germany
was
the
longest
of
the
war
.


the
``
luftwaffe
''
fighter
force
defended
the
airspace
of
german-occupied
territory
against
attack
,
first
by
raf
bomber
command
and
then
against
the
united
states
army
air
forces
(
usaaf
)
.


In
the
early
years
,
the
``
Luftwaffe
''
was
able
to
inflict
a
string
of
defeats
on
Allied
strategic
air
forces
.


In
1939
,
Bomber
Command
was
forced
to
operate
at
night
,
due
to
the
extent
of
losses
of
unescorted
heavy
bombers
flying
in
daylight
.


In
1943
,
the
USAAF
suffered
several
reverses
in
daylight
and
called
off
the
offensive
over
Germany
in
October
.


The
British
built
up
their
bomber
force
and
introduced
navigational
aids
and
tactics
such
as
the
bomber
stream
that
enabled
them
to
mount
larger
and
larger
attacks
with
an
acceptable
loss
rate
.


However
,
the
USAAF
introduced
the
P-51
Mustang
,
a
fighter
capable
of
escorting
the
USAAF
bombers
to
and
from
their
targets
in
daylight
.


with
new
fighter
tactics
,
the
eighth
air
force
gained
air
supremacy
over
nazi
germany
by
the
spring
of
1944
against
the
``
luftwaffe
''
.


American
strategic
bombing
raids
in
June-July
1944
seriously
damaged
twenty-four
synthetic
oil
plants
and
sixty-nine
refineries
,
which
brought
98
%
of
all
of
Germany
’
s
aviation
fuel
plants
to
halt
and
dropped
monthly
synthetic
oil
production
to
51,000
tons
.


After
these
attacks
,
recovery
efforts
in
the
following
month
could
only
bring
back
65
%
of
aviation
fuel
production
temporarily
.


In
the
first
quarter
of
1944
,
Nazi
Germany
produced
546,000
tons
of
aviation
fuel
,
with
503,000
tons
came
from
synthetic
fuel
by
hydrogenation
.


Aviation
fuel
stock
reserves
had
since
dropped
by
70
%
in
April
1944
,
to
370,000
tons
in
June
1944
,
and
to
175,000
tons
in
November
.


Chronic
fuel
shortages
,
severe
curtailment
of
flying
training
and
further
accelerated
deterioration
in
pilot
quality
steadily
decreased
the
``
Luftwaffe
''
s
effective
fighting
capabilities
in
the
last
months
.


By
the
end
of
the
campaign
,
American
forces
claimed
to
have
destroyed
35,783
enemy
aircraft
and
the
RAF
claimed
21,622
,
for
a
total
of
57,405
German
aircraft
claimed
destroyed
.


The
USAAF
dropped
1.46
million
tons
of
bombs
on
Axis-occupied
Europe
while
the
RAF
dropped
1.31
million
tons
,
for
a
total
of
2.77
million
tons
,
of
which
51.1
percent
was
dropped
on
Germany
.


In
addition
to
the
direct
damages
incurred
by
Germany
's
industry
and
air
force
,
the
Wehrmacht
was
forced
to
use
millions
of
men
,
thousands
of
artillery
pieces
,
and
hundreds
of
millions
of
shells
in
a
desperate
attempt
to
halt
American-British
Combined
Bomber
Offensive
.


From
January
1942
to
April
1943
,
German
arms
industry
grew
by
an
average
of
5.5
%
monthly
,
and
by
summer
1943
,
the
systematic
attack
against
German
industry
by
Allied
bombers
,
brought
the
overall
armament
production
—
during
the
period
of
May
1943
to
March
1944
—
to
a
complete
halt
.


At
the
ministerial
meeting
in
January
1945
,
Albert
Speer
noted
that
,
since
the
intensification
of
the
bombing
began
,
35
percent
fewer
tanks
,
31
percent
fewer
aircraft
and
42
percent
fewer
lorries
were
produced
as
planned
and
as
a
direct
result
of
the
bombing
.


The
German
economy
had
to
switch
vast
amount
of
resources
away
from
equipment
for
the
fighting
fronts
and
assign
them
instead
to
combat
the
bombing
threat
.


The
intensification
of
night
bombing
by
the
RAF
and
daylight
attacks
by
the
USAAF
added
to
the
destruction
of
a
major
part
of
the
German
's
industries
and
cities
,
which
caused
the
economy
to
collapse
in
the
winter
of
1944–45
.


By
this
time
,
the
Allied
armies
had
reached
the
German
border
and
the
strategic
campaign
became
fused
with
the
tactical
battles
over
the
front
.


The
air
campaign
continued
until
April
1945
,
when
the
last
strategic
bombing
missions
were
flown
and
it
ended
upon
the
capitulation
of
Germany
on
8
May
.


Operation
Cycle
is
the
name
of
the
evacuation
of
Allied
troops
from
Le
Havre
,
in
the
Pays
de
Caux
of
Upper
Normandy
from
1940
,
towards
the
end
of
the
Battle
of
France
,
during
the
Second
World
War
.


The
operation
was
preceded
by
the
better
known
rescue
of
and
French
soldiers
from
Dunkirk
in
Operation
Dynamo
On
20
May
,
the
Germans
had
captured
Abbeville
at
the
mouth
of
the
Somme
and
cut
off
the
main
Allied
armies
in
the
north
.


South
of
the
river
,
the
Allies
improvised
defences
and
made
local
counter-attacks
,
to
dislodge
the
Germans
from
bridgeheads
on
the
south
bank
and
re-capture
river
crossings
for
an
advance
northwards
to
regain
contact
with
the
armies
in
northern
France
and
Flanders
.


The
1st
Armoured
Division
arrived
in
France
from
15
May
,
without
artillery
and
short
of
units
that
had
been
diverted
to
Calais
.


The
division
joined
the
large
number
of
lines-of-communication
troops
south
of
the
Somme
,
many
of
whom
were
hurriedly
organised
into
the
Beauman
Division
and
other
improvised
units
,
despite
a
lack
of
training
and
weapons
.


French
troops
were
sent
into
the
area
,
as
Général
d'armée
Maxime
Weygand
attempted
to
build
up
a
defence
in
depth
on
the
south
bank
of
the
Somme
and
make
bigger
attacks
to
eliminate
the
German
bridgeheads
.


From
about
half
of
the
German
bridgehead
south
of
Abbeville
was
recaptured
by
Franco-British
troops
;
the
Allies
were
reinforced
by
infantry
divisions
and
the
``
4e
''
Division
``
cuirassée
''
(
4e
DCr
,
Colonel
Charles
De
Gaulle
)
but
lost
many
of
their
tanks
and
the
Germans
much
of
their
infantry
,
some
units
running
back
over
the
river
Somme
.


when
``
fall
rot
''
(
case
red
)
,
the
final
german
offensive
,
began
on
5
june
,
the
ix
corps
of
the
french
tenth
army
(
including
the
51st
(
highland
)
infantry
division
(
major-general
victor
fortune
)
of
the
british
expeditionary
force
(
bef
)
after
it
arrived
from
the
saar
on
28
may
)
,
was
pushed
back
to
the
bresle
river
.


On
9
June
,
German
tanks
entered
Rouen
on
the
Seine
,
cutting
off
the
IX
Corps
from
the
X
Corps
to
the
east
and
from
the
Seine
to
the
south
.


The
French
and
British
commanders
in
the
pocket
decided
to
make
for
Le
Havre
and
Fortune
detached
Arkforce
,
the
equivalent
of
two
brigades
,
to
guard
the
routes
back
to
the
port
.


During
the
night
of
the
remainder
of
the
Highland
Division
and
the
French
divisions
of
IX
Corps
,
prepared
to
continue
the
retreat
but
found
that
the
7th
``
Panzer
''
Division
(
``
Generalmajor
''
Erwin
Rommel
)
had
advanced
from
Rouen
through
Yvetot
to
Cany
and
Veulettes-sur-Mer
on
the
Durdent
river
.


With
an
Allied
withdrawal
to
Le
Havre
cut
off
,
the
Highlanders
and
the
French
retreated
to
St
Valery-en-Caux
,
where
from
and
soldiers
were
rescued
by
the
Navy
.


The
remainder
,
including
over
6,000
Highlanders
,
were
taken
prisoner
on
12
June
.


at
le
havre
,
from
10
to
13
june
,
troops
from
unk
,
other
british
units
in
the
port
and
allied
forces
were
evacuated
;
attempts
by
the
franco-british
to
prepare
a
``
national
redoubt
''
in
brittany
came
to
nothing
.


Operation
Cycle
was
followed
by
Operation
Ariel
from
14
to
25
June
,
in
which
another
were
embarked
from
Cherbourg
,
St.
Malo
and
other
Atlantic
and
Mediterranean
ports
,
until
the
Armistice
of
22
June
1940
.


the
battle
of
magersfontein
(
)
was
fought
on
11
december
1899
,
at
magersfontein
near
kimberley
,
south
africa
,
on
the
borders
of
the
cape
colony
and
the
independent
republic
of
the
orange
free
state
.


british
forces
under
lieutenant
general
lord
methuen
were
advancing
north
along
the
railway
line
from
the
cape
in
order
to
relieve
the
siege
of
kimberley
,
but
their
path
was
blocked
at
magersfontein
by
a
boer
force
that
was
entrenched
in
the
surrounding
hills
.


The
British
had
already
fought
a
series
of
battles
with
the
Boers
,
most
recently
at
Modder
River
,
where
the
advance
was
temporarily
halted
.


Lord
Methuen
failed
to
perform
adequate
reconnaissance
in
preparation
for
the
impending
battle
,
and
was
unaware
that
Boer
``
Vecht-generaal
''
(
Combat
General
)
De
la
Rey
had
entrenched
his
forces
at
the
foot
of
the
hills
rather
than
the
forward
slopes
as
was
the
accepted
practice
.


This
allowed
the
Boers
to
survive
the
initial
British
artillery
bombardment
;
when
the
British
troops
failed
to
deploy
from
a
compact
formation
during
their
advance
,
the
defenders
were
able
to
inflict
heavy
casualties
.


The
Highland
Brigade
suffered
the
worst
casualties
,
while
on
the
Boer
side
,
the
Scandinavian
Corps
was
destroyed
.


The
Boers
attained
a
tactical
victory
and
succeeded
in
holding
the
British
in
their
advance
on
Kimberley
.


The
battle
was
the
second
of
three
battles
during
what
became
known
as
the
Black
Week
of
the
Second
Boer
War
.


Following
their
defeat
,
the
British
delayed
at
the
Modder
River
for
another
two
months
while
reinforcements
were
brought
forward
.


General
Lord
Roberts
was
appointed
Commander
in
Chief
of
the
British
forces
in
South
Africa
and
moved
to
take
personal
command
of
this
front
.


He
subsequently
lifted
the
Siege
of
Kimberley
and
forced
Cronje
to
surrender
at
the
Battle
of
Paardeberg
.


The
Action
of
29
November
1811
was
a
minor
naval
engagement
fought
between
two
frigate
squadrons
in
the
Adriatic
Sea
during
the
Adriatic
campaign
of
the
Napoleonic
Wars
.


The
action
was
one
of
a
series
of
operations
conducted
by
the
British
Royal
Navy
and
the
French
Navy
to
contest
dominance
over
the
Adriatic
between
1807
and
1814
.


During
this
period
the
Adriatic
was
surrounded
by
French
territory
or
French
client
states
and
as
a
result
British
interference
was
highly
disruptive
to
the
movement
of
French
troops
and
supplies
.


The
action
came
over
eight
months
after
the
British
had
achieved
a
decisive
victory
over
the
French
at
the
Battle
of
Lissa
and
was
the
first
squadron
action
since
that
engagement
.


The
action
of
November
1811
was
the
result
of
the
British
interception
of
a
French
military
convoy
traveling
from
Corfu
to
Trieste
with
a
consignment
of
cannon
,
and
resulted
in
a
British
victory
,
only
one
French
ship
escaping
capture
by
the
British
force
.


It
has
been
suggested
that
this
action
was
a
factor
in
Napoleon
's
decision
to
change
the
direction
of
his
planned
eastwards
expansion
in
1812
from
the
Balkans
to
Russia
.


The
Battle
of
Samakh
was
fought
on
25
September
1918
,
during
the
Battle
of
Sharon
which
together
with
the
Battle
of
Nablus
formed
the
set
piece
Battle
of
Megiddo
fought
from
19
to
25
September
1918
,
in
the
last
months
of
the
Sinai
and
Palestine
Campaign
of
the
First
World
War
.


During
the
cavalry
phase
of
the
Battle
of
Sharon
the
Desert
Mounted
Corps
commanded
by
the
Australian
Lieutenant
General
Harry
Chauvel
,
captured
the
Esdraelon
Plain
(
also
known
as
the
Jezreel
Valley
and
the
Plain
of
Armageddon
)
behind
the
front
line
in
the
Judean
Hills
on
20
September
,
when
the
3rd
Light
Horse
Brigade
captured
Jenin
.


The
4th
Light
Horse
Brigade
,
Australian
Mounted
Division
was
deployed
guarding
supply
columns
,
and
prisoners
,
before
being
ordered
to
attack
and
capture
Samakh
on
the
shore
of
the
Sea
of
Gallilee
.


Here
the
Ottoman
and
German
garrison
had
been
ordered
by
the
commander
of
the
Yildirim
Army
Group
to
fight
to
the
last
man
.


Samakh
,
in
the
centre
of
a
rearguard
line
stretching
from
Tiberias
through
Samakh
and
on
to
Deraa
was
intended
to
cover
the
retreat
of
three
Ottoman
armies
.


The
rearguard
was
set
up
to
delay
the
advance
of
the
Egyptian
Expeditionary
Force
(
EEF
)
cavalry
in
the
Desert
Mounted
Corps
after
the
British
Empire
infantry
victories
in
the
Judean
Hills
at
the
Battle
of
Tulkarm
,
and
the
Battle
of
Tabsor
during
the
Battle
of
Sharon
.


These
and
other
battles
fought
during
the
Battle
of
Nablus
including
the
Third
Transjordan
attack
,
also
part
of
the
Battle
of
Megiddo
,
forced
the
retreat
of
the
Ottoman
Fourth
,
the
Seventh
and
the
Eighth
Armies
north
towards
Damascus
.


On
20
September
,
German
General
Otto
Liman
von
Sanders
,
the
commander
of
the
Yildirim
Army
Group
,
ordered
Samakh
's
German
and
Ottoman
garrison
to
prepare
a
strong
rearguard
defence
of
the
town
.


By
dawn
on
25
September
,
when
a
regiment
and
two
squadrons
of
the
Australian
4th
Light
Horse
Brigade
attacked
Samakh
,
the
rearguard
was
strongly
entrenched
.


The
assault
,
which
began
with
a
mounted
cavalry
charge
,
ended
two
hours
later
after
close
quarter
fighting
in
the
village
and
the
railway
station
.


After
fierce
fighting
with
bayonets
and
swords
,
from
room
to
room
in
the
railway
buildings
,
the
town
was
captured
.


This
victory
,
which
captured
the
centre
of
the
rearguard
line
,
concluded
the
Battle
of
Sharon
section
of
the
Battle
of
Megiddo
and
opened
the
way
for
the
cavalry
pursuit
to
Damascus
,
which
was
captured
on
1
October
.


By
the
time
the
Armistice
of
Mudros
between
the
Allies
and
the
Ottoman
Empire
was
signed
at
the
end
of
October
,
Aleppo
had
been
captured
and
fighting
was
in
progress
further
north
.


The
Vukovar
massacre
,
also
known
as
the
Vukovar
hospital
massacre
or
the
Ovčara
massacre
,
was
the
killing
of
Croatian
prisoners
of
war
and
civilians
by
Serb
paramilitaries
,
to
whom
they
had
been
turned
over
by
the
Yugoslav
People
's
Army
(
JNA
)
,
at
the
Ovčara
farm
southeast
of
Vukovar
on
20
November
1991
,
during
the
Croatian
War
of
Independence
.


The
massacre
occurred
shortly
after
Vukovar
's
capture
by
the
JNA
,
Territorial
Defence
(
TO
)
,
and
paramilitaries
from
neighbouring
Serbia
.


It
was
the
largest
massacre
of
the
war
and
the
worst
war
crime
in
Europe
since
World
War
II
up
until
that
point
.


in
the
final
days
of
the
battle
,
the
evacuation
of
the
vukovar
hospital
was
negotiated
between
croatian
authorities
,
the
jna
and
the
european
community
monitor
mission
in
cooperation
with
the
international
committee
of
the
red
cross
(
icrc
)
.


The
JNA
subsequently
refused
the
ICRC
access
to
the
hospital
despite
the
agreement
and
removed
approximately
300
people
from
its
premises
.


The
group
,
largely
consisting
of
Croats
but
also
including
Serbs
,
Hungarians
,
Muslims
and
two
foreign
nationals
who
fought
on
the
side
of
the
Croatian
National
Guard
,
was
initially
transported
to
the
JNA
barracks
in
Vukovar
.


Several
prisoners
were
identified
as
hospital
staff
and
removed
from
the
group
to
be
returned
to
the
hospital
while
the
rest
of
them
were
transported
to
the
Ovčara
farm
south
of
Vukovar
.


Once
at
the
farm
,
the
prisoners
were
beaten
for
several
hours
before
the
JNA
pulled
its
troops
from
the
site
,
leaving
the
prisoners
in
the
custody
of
the
Croatian
Serb
TO
and
Serbian
paramilitaries
.


The
prisoners
were
then
taken
to
a
prepared
site
,
shot
in
groups
of
ten
to
twenty
and
buried
in
a
mass
grave
.


The
mass
grave
was
discovered
in
October
1992
and
guarded
by
the
United
Nations
Protection
Force
which
had
deployed
to
the
area
earlier
that
year
.


In
1996
,
200
sets
of
remains
were
exhumed
from
the
grave
by
International
Criminal
Tribunal
for
the
former
Yugoslavia
(
ICTY
)
investigators
.


Croatia
believes
61
others
were
buried
in
a
different
grave
on
the
site
,
while
ICTY
prosecutors
believe
that
figure
stands
at
60
.


The
ICTY
convicted
two
JNA
officers
in
connection
with
the
massacre
,
and
also
tried
former
Serbian
President
Slobodan
Milošević
for
a
number
of
war
crimes
,
including
those
committed
at
Vukovar
.


Milošević
died
in
prison
before
his
trial
could
be
completed
.


Several
former
members
of
the
Croatian
Serb
TO
and
Serbian
paramilitary
units
have
been
tried
by
the
Serbian
judiciary
and
convicted
for
their
involvement
in
the
massacre
.


In
February
2015
,
the
International
Court
of
Justice
ruled
that
the
siege
,
massacre
and
simultaneous
atrocities
committed
elsewhere
in
Croatia
did
not
constitute
genocide
.


The
site
of
the
mass
grave
is
marked
by
a
monument
and
the
storage
building
used
at
Ovčara
farm
to
hold
the
prisoners
in
captivity
before
their
execution
was
rebuilt
as
a
memorial
centre
in
2006
.


By
July
2014
,
the
centre
had
been
visited
by
about
500,000
tourists
.


Operation
Coburg
(
24
January
−
1
March
1968
)
was
an
Australian
and
New
Zealand
military
action
during
the
Vietnam
War
.


the
operation
saw
heavy
fighting
between
the
1st
australian
task
force
(
1
atf
)
and
north
vietnamese
army
and
viet
cong
during
the
wider
fighting
around
long
binh
and
bien
hoa
.


American
and
South
Vietnamese
intelligence
reports
had
indicated
that
an
imminent
communist
offensive
during
the
Tet
New
Year
festival
was
likely
,
and
in
response
the
Australians
and
New
Zealanders
were
deployed
away
from
their
base
in
Phuoc
Tuy
Province
to
bolster
American
and
South
Vietnamese
forces
defending
the
Long
Binh–Bien
Hoa
complex
north-east
of
Saigon
.


1
ATF
deliberately
established
fire
support
bases
astride
the
communist
lines
of
communication
in
the
vicinity
of
the
village
of
Trang
Bom
,
expecting
that
they
would
attempt
to
destroy
them
.


The
Australians
subsequently
clashed
with
the
Viet
Cong
during
early
patrols
in
Area
of
Operations
(
AO
)
Columbus
,
while
later
Fire
Support
Base
(
FSB
)
Andersen
was
repeatedly
subjected
to
major
ground
assaults
.


although
the
operation
was
mounted
too
late
to
prevent
the
attacks
on
saigon
,
the
australians
and
new
zealanders
successfully
disrupted
the
communist
lines
of
communication
,
limiting
their
freedom
of
manoeuvre
to
attack
the
long
unk
hoa
complex
,
while
they
were
also
able
to
successfully
interdict
their
withdrawal
,
causing
heavy
casualties
.


The
operation
was
also
significant
as
it
was
the
first
deployment
of
1
ATF
outside
its
Tactical
Area
of
Responsibility
(
TAOR
)
in
Phuoc
Tuy
,
and
in
this
it
set
a
precedent
for
later
operations
outside
the
province
.


Meanwhile
,
the
remaining
Australian
forces
in
Phuoc
Tuy
Province
also
successfully
repelled
repeated
Viet
Cong
attacks
against
Ba
Ria
and
Long
Dien
,
as
part
of
the
Tet
Offensive
that
had
engulfed
population
centres
across
South
Vietnam
.


Operation
Earnest
Will
(
24
July
1987
–
26
September
1988
)
was
the
American
military
protection
of
Kuwaiti-owned
tankers
from
Iranian
attacks
in
1987
and
1988
,
three
years
into
the
Tanker
War
phase
of
the
Iran–Iraq
War
.


It
was
the
largest
naval
convoy
operation
since
World
War
II
.

escorted
the
tankers

were
the

but
u.s.

and
u.s.

.


Other
U.S.
Navy
vessels
participated
in
Operation
Earnest
Will
.


They
were
then
under
the
command
of
the
U.S.
Navy
's
Seventh
Fleet
which
had
primary
responsibility
for
combat
operations
in
the
Persian
Gulf
region
.


The
numerous
ships
used
in
Operation
Earnest
Will
mostly
consisted
of
Carrier
Battle
Groups
,
Surface
Action
Groups
and
ships
from
the
Pacific
's
Third
and
Seventh
Fleets
and
the
Mediterranean-based
Sixth
Fleet
.


They
generally
operated
in
and
near
the
Gulf
for
parts
of
their
normal
six-month
deployments
.


This
was
the
first
tactical
operation
of
the
United
States
Special
Operations
Command
(
USSOCOM
)
that
involved
Navy
SEALs
,
Special
Boat
Units
,
and
160th
Special
Operations
Aviation
Regiment
(
Airborne
)
(
``
Nightstalkers
''
)
aviators
all
working
together
.


The
Action
of
7
May
1794
was
a
minor
naval
action
fought
between
a
British
ship
of
the
line
and
a
French
frigate
early
in
the
French
Revolutionary
Wars
.


The
French
Navy
sought
to
disrupt
British
trade
by
intercepting
and
capturing
merchant
ships
with
roving
frigates
,
a
strategy
countered
by
protecting
British
convoys
with
heavier
warships
,
particularly
in
European
waters
.


On
5
May
1794
,
the
British
escorts
of
a
convoy
from
Cork
sighted
two
French
ships
approaching
and
gave
chase
.


The
ships
,
a
frigate
and
a
corvette
,
outmatched
by
their
opponents
,
separated
and
the
convoy
escorts
did
likewise
,
each
following
one
of
the
raiders
on
a
separate
course
.


By
the
evening
one
of
the
French
ships
had
successfully
escaped
,
but
the
other
was
still
under
pursuit
,
Captain
Charles
Linois
of
``
Atalante
''
attempting
a
number
of
tactics
to
drive
off
his
opponent
but
without
success
.


Eventually
,
after
a
chase
lasting
nearly
two
days
,
the
French
ship
came
within
range
of
the
much
larger
British
74-gun
third
rate
HMS
``
Swiftsure
''
and
despite
a
brave
defence
was
soon
forced
to
surrender
after
suffering
more
than
40
casualties
.


although
he
had
surrendered
his
ship
,
linois
was
widely
praised
for
his
actions
in
defending
his
ship
against
such
heavy
odds
.


In
the
aftermath
of
the
engagement
,
a
French
battle
squadron
that
formed
part
of
the
developing
Atlantic
campaign
of
May
1794
pursued
both
ships
for
the
rest
of
the
day
;
their
quarry
eventually
escaped
after
dark
.


``
Atalante
''
was
later
taken
into
the
Royal
Navy
as
HMS
``
Espion
''
.


Hurricane
Gabrielle
was
a
North
Atlantic
hurricane
that
caused
flooding
in
both
Florida
and
Newfoundland
in
September
of
2001
.


It
developed
in
the
Gulf
of
Mexico
on
the
same
day
as
the
September
11
attacks
;
after
the
attacks
,
flights
were
canceled
nationwide
for
two
days
,
and
when
Gabrielle
struck
Florida
on
September
14
,
it
caused
a
day
of
additional
cancellations
.


The
storm
moved
ashore
with
winds
of
near
Venice
,
a
city
located
south
of
the
Tampa
Bay
area
.


The
combination
of
the
winds
and
heavy
rainfall
,
which
peaked
at
in
Parrish
,
left
570,000
customers
without
power
along
the
west
coast
and
126,000
customers
without
power
on
the
east
coast
.


The
storm
caused
about
$
230
million
(
2001
USD
)
in
damage
in
Florida
.


In
the
Gulf
of
Mexico
,
high
waves
contributed
to
two
deaths
,
one
of
which
was
indirect
;
there
was
also
a
death
due
to
flooding
in
Winter
Haven
.


After
crossing
the
state
,
Gabrielle
had
the
appearance
of
an
occluded
frontal
low
or
subtropical
cyclone
;
this
was
after
the
convection
decreased
near
the
center
.


However
,
Gabrielle
gradually
re-intensified
and
became
a
hurricane
on
September
17
as
it
passed
northwest
of
Bermuda
.


The
hurricane
reached
peak
winds
of
,
but
weakened
subsequently
due
to
wind
shear
.


Gabrielle
transitioned
into
an
extratropical
cyclone
on
September
19
,
and
later
that
day
it
passed
just
southeast
of
Newfoundland
.


The
storm
produced
record
rainfall
that
caused
what
was
described
the
``
worst
flooding
in
100
years
''
in
St.
John
's
.


Several
roads
and
houses
were
flooded
in
the
region
.


The
extratropical
remnants
of
Gabrielle
continued
to
the
northeast
and
dissipated
on
September
21
.


Hurricane
Inez
was
a
major
hurricane
that
affected
the
Caribbean
,
Bahamas
,
Florida
,
and
Mexico
in
1966
.


It
was
the
first
storm
on
record
to
affect
all
of
those
areas
.


It
originated
from
a
tropical
wave
over
Africa
,
and
became
a
tropical
depression
by
September
21
.


it
moved
slowly
westward
,
initially
failing
to
intensify
much
;
it
was
upgraded
to
tropical
storm
inez
on
september
24
.


The
storm
strengthened
into
a
hurricane
and
was
quickly
intensifying
when
it
struck
the
French
overseas
region
of
Guadeloupe
on
September
27
.


Inez
severely
damaged
the
island
's
banana
and
sugar
crops
,
and
thousands
of
homes
were
damaged
,
leaving
10,000
people
homeless
.


Damage
on
Guadeloupe
was
estimated
at
$
50
million
,
and
there
were
40
deaths
.


After
entering
the
Caribbean
,
Inez
briefly
weakened
before
restrengthening
,
attaining
peak
sustained
winds
of
on
September
28
.


That
day
a
hurricane
hunters
flight
reported
a
gust
of
,
which
was
the
highest
recorded
at
the
time
.


Continuing
westward
,
Inez
made
landfall
as
a
small
hurricane
on
the
Barahona
Peninsula
of
the
Dominican
Republic
.


There
,
the
storm
flooded
many
rivers
and
destroyed
over
800
houses
.


Nationwide
,
there
were
about
100
deaths
and
$
12
million
in
damage
.


After
affecting
the
country
,
Inez
struck
southwestern
Haiti
,
where
it
was
considered
the
worst
hurricane
since
the
1920s
.


As
many
as
1,000
people
were
killed
,
and
60,000
people
were
left
homeless
.


Damage
totaled
$
20.35
million
in
Haiti
,
prompting
the
United
States
government
to
send
aid
for
the
first
time
in
nearly
ten
years
due
to
previous
mishandling
of
funds
.


Inez
weakened
quickly
over
Hispaniola
,
although
it
reintensified
into
a
major
hurricane
before
striking
southeastern
Cuba
on
September
30
.


In
the

The
Munich
air
disaster
occurred
on
6
February
1958
when
British
European
Airways
Flight
609
crashed
on
its
third
attempt
to
take
off
from
a
slush-covered
runway
at
Munich-Riem
Airport
,
West
Germany
.


On
the
plane
was
the
Manchester
United
football
team
,
nicknamed
the
``
Busby
Babes
''
,
along
with
supporters
and
journalists
.


Twenty
of
the
44
on
the
aircraft
died
at
the
scene
.


The
injured
,
some
unconscious
,
were
taken
to
the
Rechts
der
Isar
Hospital
in
Munich
where
three
more
died
,
resulting
in
23
fatalities
with
21
survivors
.


The
team
was
returning
from
a
European
Cup
match
in
Belgrade
,
Yugoslavia
,
having
eliminated
Red
Star
Belgrade
to
advance
to
the
semi-finals
of
the
competition
.


The
flight
stopped
to
refuel
in
Munich
because
a
non-stop
flight
from
Belgrade
to
Manchester
was
beyond
the
``
Elizabethan
''
-class
Airspeed
Ambassador
's
range
.


After
refuelling
,
pilots
James
Thain
and
Kenneth
Rayment
twice
abandoned
take-off
because
of
boost
surging
in
the
left
engine
.


Fearing
they
would
get
too
far
behind
schedule
,
Captain
Thain
rejected
an
overnight
stay
in
Munich
in
favour
of
a
third
take-off
attempt
.


By
then
,
snow
was
falling
,
causing
a
layer
of
slush
to
form
at
the
end
of
the
runway
.


After
the
aircraft
hit
the
slush
,
it
ploughed
through
a
fence
beyond
the
end
of
the
runway
and
the
left
wing
was
torn
off
after
hitting
a
house
.


Fearing
the
aircraft
might
explode
,
Thain
began
evacuating
passengers
while
Manchester
United
goalkeeper
Harry
Gregg
helped
pull
survivors
from
the
wreckage
.


An
investigation
by
West
German
airport
authorities
originally
blamed
Thain
,
saying
he
did
not
de-ice
the
aircraft
's
wings
,
despite
eyewitness
statements
to
the
contrary
.


It
was
later
established
that
the
crash
was
caused
by
the
slush
on
the
runway
,
which
slowed
the
plane
too
much
to
take
off
.


Thain
was
cleared
in
1968
,
ten
years
after
the
incident
.


Manchester
United
were
trying
to
become
the
third
club
to
win
three
successive
English
league
titles
;
they
were
six
points
behind
League
leaders
Wolverhampton
Wanderers
with
14
games
to
go
.


They
also
held
the
Charity
Shield
and
had
just
advanced
into
their
second
successive
European
Cup
semi-finals
.


The
team
had
not
been
beaten
for
11
matches
.


The
crash
not
only
derailed
their
title
ambitions
that
year
but
also
virtually
destroyed
the
nucleus
of
what
promised
to
be
one
of
the
greatest
generations
of
players
in
English
football
history
.


It
took
10
years
for
the
club
to
recover
,
with
Busby
rebuilding
the
team
and
winning
the
European
Cup
in
1968
with
a
new
generation
of
``
Babes
''
.


The

oxfordshire
,
shortly
after
taking
off
from
raf
abingdon
.


The
flight
was
captained
by
Flt
Lt
John
Akin
.


All
41
people
aboard
,
including
six
crew
,
perished
in
the
crash
,
making
it
the
third
worst
air
crash
in
the
United
Kingdom
at
the
time
.


A
subsequent
inquest
jury
returned
a
verdict
of
accidental
death
.


The
inquest
found
that
the
accident
was
due
to
metal
fatigue
of
two
bolts
in
the
elevator
system
.


The
Battle
of
Sullivan
's
Island
or
the
Battle
of
Fort
Sullivan
was
fought
on
June
28
,
1776
,
during
the
American
Revolutionary
War
.


It
took
place
near
Charleston
,
South
Carolina
,
during
the
first
British
attempt
to
capture
the
city
from
American
forces
.


It
is
also
sometimes
referred
to
as
the
First
Siege
of
Charleston
,
owing
to
a
more
successful
British
siege
in
1780
.


The
British
organized
an
expedition
in
early
1776
for
operations
in
the
rebellious
southern
colonies
of
North
America
.


Delayed
by
logistical
concerns
and
bad
weather
,
the
expedition
reached
the
coast
of
North
Carolina
in
May
1776
.


Finding
conditions
unsuitable
for
their
operations
,
General
Henry
Clinton
and
Admiral
Sir
Peter
Parker
decided
instead
to
act
against
Charlestown
.


Arriving
there
in
early
June
,
troops
were
landed
on
Long
Island
(
now
called
Isle
of
Palms
)
,
near
Sullivan
's
Island
where
Colonel
William
Moultrie
commanded
a
partially
constructed
fort
,
in
preparation
for
a
naval
bombardment
and
land
assault
.


General
Charles

Operations
Taxable
,
Glimmer
and
Big
Drum
were
tactical
military
deceptions
conducted
on
6
June
1944
in
support
of
the
Allied
landings
in
Normandy
.


The
operations
formed
the
naval
component
of
Operation
Bodyguard
,
a
wider
series
of
tactical
and
strategic
deceptions
surrounding
the
invasion
.


Small
boats
,
along
with
aircraft
from
RAF
Bomber
Command
,
simulated
invasion
fleets
approaching
Cap
d'Antifer
,
Pas-de-Calais
and
Normandy
.


Glimmer
and
Taxable
played
on
the
German
belief
,
amplified
by
Allied
deception
efforts
over
the
preceding
months
,
that
the
main
invasion
force
would
land
in
the
Calais
region
.


Big
Drum
was
positioned
on
the
western
flank
of
the
real
invasion
force
to
try
to
confuse
German
forces
about
the
scale
of
the
landings
.


These
operations
complemented
Operation
Titanic
,
which
was
intended
to
confuse
the
Germans
about
the
D-Day
airborne
forces
.


It
is
unclear
whether
the
operations
were
successful
,
due
to
the
complexity
of
their
execution
,
poor
weather
,
and
lack
of
response
from
German
forces
.


It
is
possible
that
they
contributed
to
the
overall
confusion
of
D-Day
as
part
of
the
wider
Bodyguard
plan
.


The
Zealot
Temple
Siege
(
68
AD
)
was
a
short
siege
of
the
Temple
in
Jerusalem
fought
between
Jewish
factions
during
the
Great
Jewish
Revolt
against
the
Roman
Empire
(
66–70
AD
)
.


According
to
the
historian
Josephus
,
the
forces
of
Ananus
ben
Ananus
,
one
of
the
heads
of
the
Judean
provisional
government
and
former
High
Priest
of
Israel
,
besieged
the
Zealots
who
held
the
Temple
.


When
John
of
Giscala
led
the
Zealots
to
believe
that
Ananus
had
contacted
the
Roman
General
Vespasian
for
assistance
in
retaking
control
of
all
Jerusalem
,
the
Zealots
,
driven
to
desperation
,
asked
the
Edomites
(
Idumeans
)
for
assistance
in
preventing
the
delivery
of
the
city
to
the
Romans
.


When
the
Edomites
arrived
,
the
Zealots
opened
the
gates
of
Jerusalem
to
them
,
and
the
Edomites
slaughtered
ben
Hanan
's
(
Ananus
ben
Ananus
)
forces
,
killing
him
as
well
.


After
freeing
the
Zealots
from
the
Temple
,
the
Edomites
and
Zealots
massacred
the
common
people
.


Jerusalem
mostly
remained
in
the
control
of
the
Zealots
until
70
AD
,
when
it
was
sacked
by
Rome
and
the
Temple
was
destroyed
.


Avianca
Flight

was
a
Boeing
747-200B
on
an
international
scheduled
passenger
flight
from
Frankfurt
via
Paris
,
Madrid
,
and
Caracas
to
Bogotá
that
crashed
on
27
November
1983
.


It
took
off
from
Charles
de

Airport
in
Paris
at
22:25
on
26
November
1983
for
Madrid
Barajas
Airport
;
take-off
was
delayed
to
wait
for
additional
passengers
from
a
Lufthansa
flight
due
to
a
cancellation
of
the
segment
Paris-Frankfurt
by
Avianca
for
operational
reasons
.


The
jet
had
been
cleared
to
land
at

,
the
first
of
two
scheduled
en
route
stops
originating
at
Paris
,
with
a
final
destination
of

Colombia
.


During
the
instrument

33
,
the
747
crashed
on
a
hill
approximately
7.5
miles
south
east
of
the
airport
,
killing
181
people
,
including
19
on-duty
and
four
off-duty
crew
members
.


The
11
surviving
passengers
were
seriously
injured
.


The
cause
of
the
accident
was
judged
to
be
pilot
error
,
having
incorrectly
determined
the
position
of
the
plane
.


As
of

,
Avianca
Flight

remains
the
second-deadliest
aviation
accident
in
Spanish
territory
behind
the
Tenerife

disaster
.


and
the
worst
accident
in
the
history
of
Avianca
.


The
Mexican
War
of
Independence
(
)
was
an
armed
conflict
,
lasting
over
a
decade
,
which
had
several
distinct
phases
and
took
place
in
different
regions
of
the
Spanish
colony
of
New
Spain
.


Events
in
Spain
itself
had
a
direct
impact
on
the
outbreak
of
the
insurgency
in
1810
and
in
the
alliance
of
insurgent
leader
Vicente
Guerrero
and
royalist-officer-turned
insurgent
Agustín
de
Iturbide
in
1821
,
which
brought
about
independence
.


Napoleon
Bonaparte
's
invasion
of
Spain
in
1808
touched
off
a
crisis
of
legitimacy
of
crown
rule
,
since
he
had
placed
his
brother
Joseph
on
the
Spanish
throne
after
forcing
the
abdication
of
the
Spanish
monarch
Charles
IV
.


In
many
of
Spain
's
overseas
possessions
the
local
response
was
to
set
up
juntas
ruling
in
the
name
of
the
Bourbon
monarchy
.


In
New
Spain
,
however
,
peninsular-born
Spaniards
overthrew
the
rule
of
Viceroy
José
de
Iturrigaray
(
1803–08
)
.


In
1810
,
a
few
American-born
Spaniards
in
favor
of
independence
began
plotting
an
uprising
against
Spanish
rule
.


It
occurred
when
the
parish
priest
of
the
village
of
Dolores
,
Miguel
Hidalgo
y
Costilla
,
issued
the
Cry
of
Dolores
on
September
16
,
1810
.


The
Hidalgo
Revolt
touched
off
the
armed
insurgency
for
independence
,
lasting
until
1821
.


The
colonial
regime
did
not
expect
the
size
and
duration
of
the
insurgency
,
which
spread
from
the
Bajío
region
north
of
Mexico
City
to
the
Pacific
and
Gulf
Coasts
.


In
1820
when
Spanish
liberals
overthrew
the
autocratic
rule
of
Ferdinand
VII
and
arch-conservatives
in
New
Spain
saw
independence
as
a
way
to
maintain
their
position
,
former
royalists
and
old
insurgents
formed
an
alliance
under
the
Plan
of
Iguala
and
forged
the
Army
of
the
Three
Guarantees
.


the
momentum
of
independence
saw
the
collapse
of
royal
government
in
mexico
and
the
treaty
of
UNK
ended
the
conflict
.


the
movement
for
independence
was
inspired
by
the
age
of
enlightenment
and
the
american
and
french
revolutions
.


By
that
time
the
educated
elite
of
New
Spain
had
begun
to
reflect
on
the
relations
between
Spain
and
its
colonial
kingdoms
.


Changes
in
the
social
and
political
structure
occasioned
by
Bourbon
Reforms
and
a
deep
economic
crisis
in
New
Spain
caused
discomfort
among
the
native-born
Creole
elite
.


The
dramatic
political
events
in
Europe
,
the
French
Revolutionary
Wars
and
the
conquests
by
Napoleon
deeply
influenced
events
in
New
Spain
.


In
1808
,
Charles
IV
and
Ferdinand
VII
were
forced
to
abdicate
in
favor
of
the
French
Emperor
,
who
made
his
elder
brother
Joseph
king
of
New
Spain
.


The
same
year
,
the
ayuntamiento
(
city
council
)
of
Mexico
City
,
supported
by
viceroy
José
de
Iturrigaray
,
claimed
sovereignty
in
the
absence
of
the
legitimate
king
.


That
led
to
a
coup
against
the
viceroy
;
when
it
was
suppressed
,
the
leaders
of
the
movement
were
jailed
.


Despite
the
defeat
in
Mexico
City
,
small
groups
of
rebels
met
in
other
cities
of
New
Spain
to
raise
movements
against
colonial
rule
.


In
1810
,
after
being
discovered
,
Querétaro
conspirators
chose
to
take
up
arms
on
September
16
in
the
company
of
peasants
and
indigenous
inhabitants
of
Dolores
(
Guanajuato
)
.


They
were
called
to
action
by
the
secular
Catholic
priest
Miguel
Hidalgo
,
former
rector
of
the
Colegio
de
San
Nicolás
Obispo
.


After
1810
the
independence
movement
went
through
several
stages
,
as
leaders
were
imprisoned
or
executed
by
forces
loyal
to
Spain
.


at
first
the
rebels
disputed
the
legitimacy
of
the
unk
joseph
bonaparte
,
while
recognizing
the
sovereignty
of
ferdinand
vii
over
spain
and
its
colonies
.


Later
the
leaders
took
more
radical
positions
,
rejecting
the
Spanish
claim
and
espousing
a
new
social
order
to
include
the
abolition
of
slavery
.


Secular
priest
José
María
Morelos
called
the
separatist
provinces
to
form
the
Congress
of
Chilpancingo
,
which
beacme
the
legal
framework
for
the
insurgency
.


After
the
defeat
of
Morelos
,
the
movement
survived
as
a
guerrilla
war
under
the
leadership
of
Vicente
Guerrero
.


By
1820
,
the
few
rebel
groups
survived
most
notably
in
the
Sierra
Madre
del
Sur
and
Veracruz
.


The
reinstatement
of
the
liberal
Constitution
of
Cadiz
in
1820
resulted
in
a
change
of
mind
among
the
elite
groups
who
had
supported
Spanish
rule
.


Monarchist
Creoles
affected
by
the
constitution
decided
to
support
the
independence
of
New
Spain
;
they
sought
an
alliance
with
the
former
insurgent
resistance
.


Agustín
de
Iturbide
led
the
military
arm
of
the
conspirators
and
in
early
1821
he
met
Vicente
Guerrero
.


Both
proclaimed
the
Plan
of
Iguala
,
which
called
for
the
union
of
all
insurgent
factions
.


It
was
supported
by
both
the
aristocracy
and
clergy
of
New
Spain
.


It
called
for
a
monarchy
in
an
independent
Mexico
.


Finally
,
the
independence
of
Mexico
was
achieved
on
September
27
,
1821
.


After
that
,
the
mainland
of
New
Spain
was
organized
as
the
Mexican
Empire
.


This
ephemeral
Catholic
monarchy
was
changed
to
a
federal
republic
in
1823
,
due
both
to
internal
conflicts
and
the
separation
of
Central
America
from
Mexico
.


After
some
Spanish
reconquest
attempts
,
including
the
expedition
of
Isidro
Barradas
in
1829
,
Spain
under
the
rule
of
Isabella
II
recognized
the
independence
of
Mexico
in
1836
.


Hurricane
Kate
was
the
final
in
a
series
of
tropical
cyclones
to
impact
the
United
States
during
1985
,
and
the
latest
in
any
calendar
year
to
strike
the
country
at
hurricane
intensity
on
record
.


The

,
and
third
major
hurricane
of

originated
from
the

of
an
upper-level
trough
and
tropical
wave
northeast
of
Puerto
Rico
on
November
15
.


though
the
system
tracked
erratically
during
the
first
hours
of
its
existence
,
the
intensification
of
a
region
of
high
pressure
to
the
cyclone
's
north
caused
kate
to
turn
westward
.


A
favorable
atmospheric
pattern
allowed
the
newly
developed
system
to
intensify
to
hurricane
intensity
on
November
16
,
and
further
to
Category
2
intensity
three
days
later
.


Kate
made
its
first
landfall
on
the
northern
coast
of
Cuba
at
this
intensity
prior
to
emerging
as
a
slightly
weaker
storm
during
the
evening
hours
of
November
19
.


Once
clear
of
land
,
it
began
to
strengthen
quickly
,
becoming
a
Category
3
and
reaching
its
peak
intensity
of
120
mph
(
195
km/h
)
the
following
day
.


On
November
21
,
a
cold
front
moving
across
the
Mississippi
Valley
resulted
in
a
north
and
eventual
northeast
turn
of
the
cyclone
,
and
on
November
22
,
Kate
came
ashore
near
Mexico
Beach
,
Florida
,
as
a
minimal
Category
2
hurricane
with
winds
of
100
mph
(
160
km/h
)
.


Gradual
weakening
ensued
as
the
cyclone
moved
along
the
Southeast
United
States
coastline
,
and
Kate
transitioned
to
an
extratropical
cyclone
on
November
23
,
a
day
after
exiting
the
coastline
of
North
Carolina
.


The
threat
of
Hurricane
Kate
in
Cuba
prompted
the
evacuation
of
360,000
people
.


Heavy
rainfall
in
Cuba
caused
numerous
mudslides
and
flooding
,
killing
10
people
and
leading
to
severe
agriculture
damage
.


Wind
gusts
over
hurricane
intensity
resulted
in
widespread
power
outages
,
significant
building
damage
,
and
major
crop
damage
.


Damage
totaled
roughly
$
400
million
,
making
it
the
most
damaging
hurricane
to
strike
the
island
in
many
decades
.


In
preparation
for
the
system
's
arrival
,
many
hurricane
watches
and
warnings
were
put
into
effect
.


hundreds
of
thousands
of
residents
were
evacuated
,
and
florida
governor
bob
graham
declared
a
state
of
emergency
for
six
counties
;
this
was
later
cancelled
following
the
relatively
minor
impacts
of
kate
.


In
addition
,
many
shelters
were
opened
.


When
Kate
struck
the
Florida
Panhandle
,
it
became
the
first
hurricane
to
make
landfall
in
that
location
since
Hurricane
Eloise
in
1975
.


storm

and
flooding
rains
destroyed
much
of
the
oyster
industry
,
causing
many
people
to
lose
their
jobs
in
the
weeks
after
the
storm
.


Gusts
over
100
mph
(
160
km/h
)
contributed
to
downed
trees
and
building
damage
,
while
the
combination
of
wind
and
rain
led
to
downed
power
poles
.


Across
the
remainder
of
the
southeast
United
States
,
several
inches
of
rainfall
led
to
flash
flooding
,
damage
to
roadways
,
and
major
tree
damage
.


Overall
,
Kate
resulted
in
15
fatalities
and
$
700
million
in
damage
.


The
``
Virginius
''
Affair
was
a
diplomatic
dispute
that
occurred
from
October
1873
to
February
1875
between
the
United
States
,
the
United
Kingdom
,
and
Spain
(
then
in
control
of
Cuba
)
,
during
the
Ten
Years
'
War
.


``
Virginius
''
was
a
fast
American
ship
hired
by
Cuban
insurrectionists
to
land
men
and
munitions
in
Cuba
to
attack
the
Spanish
regime
there
.


It
was
captured
by
the
Spanish
,
who
wanted
to
try
the
men
onboard
(
many
of
whom
were
American
and
British
citizens
)
as
pirates
and
execute
them
.


The
Spanish
executed
53
of
the
men
but
stopped
when
the
British
government
demanded
it
.


Throughout
the
ordeal
there
was
loose
talk
that
the
U.S.
might
declare
war
on
Spain
.


During
the
lengthy
negotiations
the
Spanish
government
had
undergone
several
changes
in
leadership
.


US
consul
Caleb
Cushing
ended
the
episode
by
negotiating
$
80,000
in
reparations
to
be
paid
to
the
families
of
the
Americans
who
were
executed
.


British
families
were
compensated
by
the
Spanish
government
through
negotiation
prior
to
American
compensation
.


The
incident
was
remarkable
for
the
use
of
international
diplomacy
for
a
peaceful
settlement
implemented
by
US
Secretary
of
State
Hamilton
Fish
,
rather
than
opting
for
a
costly
war
between
the
United
States
and
Spain
.


The
``
Virginius
''
Affair
started
a
resurgence
in
the
US
Navy
following
the
American
Civil
War
;
its
fleet
had
been
heretofore
inferior
to
the
warships
of
Spain
.

The
Ash
Wednesday
bushfires
,
known
in
South
Australia
as
Ash
Wednesday
II
,
were
a
series
of
bushfires
that
occurred
in
south-eastern
Australia
on
16
February
1983
,
which
was
Ash
Wednesday
in
the
Christian
calendar
.


Within
twelve
hours
,
more
than
180
fires
fanned
by
winds
of
up
to
110
km/h
(
68
mph
)
caused
widespread
destruction
across
the
states
of
Victoria
and
South
Australia
.


Years
of
severe
drought
and
extreme
weather
combined
to
create
one
of
Australia
's
worst
fire
days
in
a
century
.


The
fires
became
the
deadliest
bushfire
in
Australian
history
until
the
Black
Saturday
bushfires
in
2009
.


In
Victoria
47
people
died
.


There
were
28
deaths
in
South
Australia
.


This
included
14
CFA
and
3
CFS
volunteer
fire-fighters
who
died
across
both
states
that
day
.


Many
fatalities
were
as
a
result
of
firestorm
conditions
caused
by
a
sudden
and
violent
wind
change
in
the
evening
which
rapidly
changed
the
direction
and
size
of
the
fire
front
.


The
speed
and
ferocity
of
the
flames
,
aided
by
abundant
fuels
and
a
landscape
immersed
in
smoke
,
made
fire
suppression
and
containment
impossible
.


In
many
cases
,
residents
fended
for
themselves
as
fires
broke
communications
,
cut
off
escape
routes
and
severed
electricity
and
water
supplies
.


Up
to
8,000
people
were
evacuated
in
Victoria
at
the
height
of
the
crisis
and
a
state
of
disaster
was
declared
for
the
first
time
in
South
Australia
's
history
.


More
than
35
townhouses
were
burned
in
a
small
town
in
Victoria
.


Ash
Wednesday
was
one
of
Australia
's
costliest
natural
disasters
.


More
than
3,700
buildings
were
destroyed
or
damaged
and
2,545
individuals
and
families
lost
their
homes
.


Livestock
losses
were
very
high
,
with
more
than
340,000
sheep
,
18,000
cattle
and
numerous
native
animals
either
dead
or
later
destroyed
.


A
total
of
4,540
insurance
claims
were
paid
totalling
A
$
176
million
with
a
total
estimated
cost
of
well
over
$
400
million
(
1983
values
)
for
both
states
or
$
1.3
billion
in
adjusted
terms
(
2007
)
.


The
emergency
saw
the
largest
number
of
volunteers
called
to
duty
from
across
Australia
at
the
same
time—an
estimated
130,000

instead
with
the
post-2003
Iraq

the
nickname
video
game
war
after
the
daily
broadcast
of

.


On
2
August
1990
the
Iraqi
Army
invaded
and
occupied
Kuwait
,
which
was
met
with
international
condemnation
and
brought
immediate
economic
sanctions
against
Iraq
by
members
of
the
UN
Security
Council
.


Together
with
the
UK
prime
minister
Margaret
Thatcher
,
who
had
resisted
the
invasion
by
Argentina
of
the
Falkland
Islands
a
decade
earlier
,
American
President
George
H.
W.
Bush
deployed
US
forces
into
Saudi
Arabia
,
and
urged
other
countries
to
send
their
own
forces
to
the
scene
.


An
array
of
nations
joined
the
coalition
,
forming
the
largest
military
alliance
since
World
War
II
.


The
great
majority
of
the
coalition
's
military
forces
were
from
the
US
,
with
Saudi
Arabia
,
the
United
Kingdom
and
Egypt
as
leading
contributors
,
in
that
order
.


Kuwait
and
Saudi
Arabia
paid
around
US
$
32
billion
of
the
US
$
60
billion
cost
.


The
war
marked
the
introduction
of
live
news
broadcasts
from
the
front
lines
of
the
battle
,
principally
by
the
US
network
CNN
.


The
initial
conflict
to
expel
Iraqi
troops
from
Kuwait
began
with
an
aerial
and
naval
bombardment
on
17
January
1991
,
continuing
for
five
weeks
.


This
was
followed
by
a
ground
assault
on
24
February
.


This
was
a
decisive
victory
for
the
coalition
forces
,
who
liberated
Kuwait
and
advanced
into
Iraqi
territory
.


The
coalition
ceased
its
advance
and
declared
a
ceasefire
100
hours
after
the
ground
campaign
started
.


Aerial
and
ground
combat
was
confined
to
Iraq
,
Kuwait
,
and
areas
on
Saudi
Arabia
's
border
.


Iraq
launched
Scud
missiles
against
coalition
military
targets
in
Saudi
Arabia
and
against
Israel
.


The
invasion
of
Kuwait
on
2
August
1990
was
a
two-day
operation
conducted
by
Iraq
against
the
neighboring
State
of
Kuwait
,
which
resulted
in
the
seven-month-long
Iraqi
occupation
of
the
country
.


This
invasion
and
Iraq
's
subsequent
refusal
to
withdraw
from
Kuwait
by
a
deadline
mandated
by
the
United
Nations
led
to
military
intervention
by
a
United
Nations-authorized
coalition
of
forces
led
by
the
United
States
.


These
events
came
to
be
known
as
the
first
Gulf
War
and
resulted
in
the
expulsion
of
Iraqi
forces
from
Kuwait
and
the
Iraqis
setting
600
Kuwaiti
oil
wells
on
fire
during
their
retreat
.


In
early
1990
Iraq
was
accusing
Kuwait
of
stealing
Iraqi
petroleum
through
slant
drilling
,
although
some
Iraqi
sources
indicated
Saddam
Hussein
's
decision
to
attack
Kuwait
was
made
a
few
months
before
the
actual
invasion
.


Some
feel
there
were
several
reasons
for
the
Iraqi
move
,
including
Iraq
's
inability
to
pay
the
more
than
US
$
14
billion
that
it
had
borrowed
to
finance
the
Iran–Iraq
War
,
and
Kuwaiti
high
petroleum
production
levels
which
kept
revenues
down
for
Iraq
.


the
invasion
started
on
2
august
1990
,
and
within
two
days
most
of
the
kuwait
armed
forces
were
either
overrun
by
the
iraqi
republican
guard
or
fell
back
to
neighbouring
saudi
arabia
and
bahrain
.


Iraq
set
up
a
puppet
government
known
as
the
``
Republic
of
Kuwait
''
to
rule
over
Kuwait
and
then
annexed
it
outright
,
when
Saddam
Hussein
announced
a
few
days
later
that
it
was
the
19th
province
of
Iraq
.


The
Battle
of
Stavishche
(
Polish
:
Bitwa
pod
Stawiszczami
)
,
also
called
the
Siege
of
Stawiszcze
,
took
place
between
July
7
-
October
7
,
1664
,
during
the
Russo-Polish
War
(
1654–67
)
.


Polish
Crown
forces
under
Stefan
Czarniecki
besieged
the
town
of
Stavyshche
(
Stawiszcze
)
,
which
at
that
time
belonged
to
Polish-Lithuanian
Commonwealth
’
s
Kiev
Voivodeship
.


The
residents
of
Stavyshche
rebelled
against
Polish
rule
,
and
as
a
result
,
the
town
was
destroyed
in
January
1665
.


In
mid-1664
,
Polish
forces
under
Czarniecki
raided
Right-bank
Ukraine
.


at
the
same
time
,
the
town
of
unk
,
located
near
kiev
rebelled
against
polish
rule
(
see
treaty
of
andrusovo
)
.


Its
siege
began
on
July
7
,
and
lasted
four
months
,
after
which
the
defenders
surrendered
,
due
to
hunger
and
lack
of
ammunition
.


Leaders
of
the
rebellion
were
caught
and
killed
,
and
the
town
had
to
pay
a
large
fine
to
Polish
troops
.


Soon
afterwards
,
another
rebellion
began
at
Stavyshche
.


This
time
,
Czarniecki
ordered
to
murder
all
residents
,
and
burn
the
town
to
the
ground
.


Hurricane
Dora
was
the
first
tropical
cyclone
on
record
to
make
landfall
over
the
First
Coast
of
Florida
at
hurricane
intensity
.


The
sixth
tropical
storm
and
second
hurricane
of
the
1964
season
,
Dora
developed
from
a
tropical
wave
near
the
coast
of
Senegal
on
August
28
.


after
a
reconnaissance
aircraft
flight
on
september
1
,
the
depression
was
upgraded
to
tropical
storm
dora
.


It
then
curved
northeastward
and
continued
to
strengthen
.


By
early
on
September
3
,
Dora
became
a
Category
1
hurricane
.


Six
hours
later
,
the
storm
reached
Category
2
intensity
.


Intensification
slowed
somewhat
,
though
Dora
became
a
Category
3
on
September
5
.


Deepening
further
,
the
storm
peaked
as
a
Category
4
with
maximum
sustained
winds
of
130
mph
(
215
km/h
)
early
the
following
day
.


at
18:00
utc
on
september
6
,
dora
weakened
to
a
category
3
hurricane
,
then
a
category
2
hurricane
while
curving
westward
early
the
following
day
.


Later
on
September
7
,
Dora
re-strengthened
into
a
Category
3
hurricane
.


Approaching
the
east
coast
of
Florida
,
Dora
's
motion
became
erratic
,
making
a
few
cyclonic
loops
.


Around
04:00
UTC
on
September
10
,
the
hurricane
made
landfall
near
St.
Augustine
,
Florida
,
with
winds
of
115
mph
(
185
km/h
)
.


Two
hours
later
,
Dora
weakened
to
a
Category
2
hurricane
.


However
,
deterioration
then
slowed
,
with
the
hurricane
falling
to
tropical
storm
intensity
over
Jefferson
County
on
September
11
.


Dora
then
briefly
drifted
over
southwestern
Georgia
,
until
turned
east-northeastward

The
French
Wars
of
Religion
were
a
prolonged
period
of
war
and
popular
unrest
between
Catholics
and
Huguenots
(
Reformed/Calvinist
Protestants
)
in
the
Kingdom
of
France
between
1562
and
1598
.


It
is
estimated
that
three
million
people
perished
in
this
period
from
violence
,
famine
,
or
disease
in
what
is
considered
the
second
deadliest
religious
war
in
European
history
(
surpassed
only
by
the
Thirty
Years
'
War
,
which
took
eight
million
lives
)
.


Much
of
the
conflict
took
place
during
the
long
regency
of
Queen
Catherine
de
'
Medici
,
widow
of
Henry
II
of
France
,
for
her
minor
sons
.


it
also
involved
a
dynastic
power
struggle
between
powerful
noble
families
in
the
line
for
succession
to
the
french
throne
:
the
wealthy
,
ambitious
,
and
fervently
catholic
ducal
house
of
guise
(
a
cadet
branch
of
the
house
of
lorraine
,
who
claimed
descent
from
charlemagne
)
and
their
ally
anne
de
montmorency
,
constable
of
france
(
i.e.
,
commander
in
chief
of
the
french
armed
forces
)
versus
the
less
wealthy
house
of
UNK
(
a
branch
of
the
house
of
bourbon
)
,
princes
of
the
blood
in
the
line
of
succession
to
the
throne
who
were
sympathetic
to
calvinism
.


Foreign
allies
provided
financing
and
other
assistance
to
both
sides
,
with
Habsburg
Spain
and
the
Duchy
of
Savoy
supporting
the
Guises
,
and
England
supporting
the
Protestant
side
led
by
the
Condés
and
by
the
Protestant
Jeanne
d'Albret
,
wife
of
Antoine
de
Bourbon
,
King
of
Navarre
,
and
her
son
,
Henry
of
Navarre
.


Moderates
,
primarily
associated
with
the
French
Valois
monarchy
and
its
advisers
,
tried
to
balance
the
situation
and
avoid
open
bloodshed
.


This
group
(
pejoratively
known
as
Politiques
)
put
their
hopes
in
the
ability
of
a
strong
centralized
government
to
maintain
order
and
harmony
.


In
contrast
to
the
previous
hardline
policies
of
Henri
II
and
his
father
Francis
I
,
they
began
introducing
gradual
concessions
to
Huguenots
.


A
most
notable
moderate
,
at
least
initially
,
was
the
queen
mother
,
Catherine
de
'
Medici
.


Catherine
,
however
,
later
hardened
her
stance
and
,
at
the
time
of
the
St.
Bartholomew
's
Day
massacre
in
1572
,
sided
with
the
Guises
.


This
pivotal
historical
event
involved
a
complete
breakdown
of
state
control
resulting
in
series
of
riots
and
massacres
in
which
Catholic
mobs
killed
between
5,000
and
30,000
Protestants
over
a
period
of
weeks
throughout
the
entire
kingdom
.


at
the
conclusion
of
the
conflict
in
1598
,
the
protestant
henry
of
navarre
,
heir
to
the
french
throne
,
converted
to
catholicism
and
was
crowned
henry
iv
of
france
.


He
issued
the
Edict
of
Nantes
,
which
granted
Huguenots
substantial
rights
and
freedoms
though
this
did
not
end
Catholic
hostility
towards
them
or
towards
him
,
personally
.


The
wars
of
religion
threatened
the
authority
of
the
monarchy
,
already
fragile
under
the
rule
of
Catherine
's
three
sons
and
the
last
Valois
kings
:
Francis
II
,
Charles
IX
,
and
Henry
III
.


This
changed
under
the
reign
of
their
Bourbon
successor
Henry
IV
.


The
edict
of
Nantes
was
revoked
later
in
1685
with
the
Edict
of
Fontainebleau
by
Louis
XIV
of
France
.


Henry
IV
's
wise
governance
and
selection
of
able
administrators
did
leave
a
legacy
of
a
strong
centralized
government
,
stability
,
and
economic
prosperity
that
has
gained
him
the
reputation
as
France
's
best
and
most
beloved
monarch
,
earning
him
the
designation
``
Good
King
Henry
''
.


On
18
November
1987
,
at
approximately
19:30
,
a
fire
broke
out
at
King
's
Cross
St
Pancras
tube
station
,
a
major
interchange
on
the
London
Underground
.


As
well
as
the
mainline
railway
stations
above
ground
and
subsurface
platforms
for
the
Metropolitan
,
Circle
and
Hammersmith
&
City
lines
,
there
were
platforms
deeper
underground
for
the
Northern
,
Piccadilly
,
and
Victoria
lines
.


The
fire
started
under
a
wooden
escalator
serving
the
Piccadilly
line
and
,
at
19:45
,
erupted
in
a
flashover
into
the
underground
ticket
hall
,
killing
31
people
and
injuring
100
.


A
public
inquiry
was
conducted
from
February
to
June
1988
.


The
investigators
reproduced
the
fire
twice
,
once
to
determine
whether
grease
under
the
escalator
was
ignitable
,
and
the
other
to
determine
whether
a
computer
simulation
of
the
fire—which
would
have
determined
the
cause
of
the
flashover—was
accurate
.


The
inquiry
determined
that
the
fire
had
started
due
to
a
lit
match
being
dropped
onto
the
escalator
.


The
fire
seemed
minor
until
it
suddenly
increased
in
intensity
,
and
shot
a
violent
,
prolonged
tongue
of
fire
,
and
billowing
smoke
,
up
into
the
ticket
hall
.


This
sudden
transition
in
intensity
,
and
the
spout
of
fire
,
was
due
to
the
previously
unknown
trench
effect
,
discovered
by
the
computer
simulation
of
the
fire
,
and
confirmed
in
two
scale
model
tests
.


London
Underground
were
strongly
criticised
for
their
attitude
toward
fires
.


staff
were
complacent
because
there
had
never
been
a
fatal
fire
on
the
underground
,
and
had
been
given
little
or
no
training
to
deal
with
fires
or
evacuation
.


A
report
was
published
on
the
inquiry
,
leading
to
resignations
of
senior
management
in
both
London
Underground
and
London
Regional
Transport
and
to
the
introduction
of
new
fire
safety
regulations
.


Wooden
escalators
were
gradually
replaced
with
metal
escalators
on
the
London
Underground

The
Battle
of
Lepanto
was
a
naval
engagement
that
took
place
on
7
October
1571
when
a
fleet
of
the
Holy
League
,
a
coalition
of
European
Catholic
states
arranged
by
Pope
Pius
V
,
inflicted
a
major
defeat
on
the
fleet
of
the
Ottoman
Empire
in
the
Gulf
of
Patras
.


The
Ottoman
forces
were
sailing
westward
from
their
naval
station
in
``
Lepanto
''
(
the
Venetian
name
of
ancient
``
Naupactus
''
,
Ottoman
``
''
)
when
they
met
the
fleet
of
the
Holy
League
which
was
sailing
east
from
Messina
,
Sicily
.


The
Spanish
Empire
and
the
Venetian
Republic
were
the
main
powers
of
the
coalition
,
as
the
league
was
largely
financed
by
Philip
II
of
Spain
and
Venice
was
the
main
contributor
of
ships
.


In
the
history
of
naval
warfare
,
Lepanto
marks
the
last
major
engagement
in
the
Western
world
to
be
fought
almost
entirely
between
rowing
vessels
,
namely
the
galleys
and
galeasses
which
were
the
direct
descendants
of
ancient
trireme
warships
.


The
battle
was
in
essence
an
``
infantry
battle
on
floating
platforms
''
.


It
was
the
largest
naval
battle
in
Western
history
since
classical
antiquity
,
involving
more
than
400
warships
.


over
the
following
decades
,
the
increasing
importance
of
the
galleon
and
the
line
of
battle
tactic
would
displace
the
galley
as
the
major
warship
of
its
era
,
marking
the
beginning
of
the
``
age
of
sail
''
.


The
victory
of
the
Holy
League
is
of
great
importance
in
the
history
of
Europe
and
of
the
Ottoman
Empire
,
marking
the
turning-point
of
Ottoman
military
expansion
into
the
Mediterranean
,
although
the
Ottoman
wars
in
Europe
would
continue
for
another
century
.


It
has
long
been
compared
to
the
Battle
of
Salamis
,
both
for
tactical
parallels
and
for
its
crucial
importance
in
the
defense
of
Europe
against
imperial
expansion
.


It
was
also
of
great
symbolic
importance
in
a
period
when
Europe
was
torn
by
its
own
wars
of
religion
following
the
Protestant
Reformation
.


Pope
Pius
V
instituted
the
feast
of
Our
Lady
of
Victory
,
and
Philip
II
of
Spain
used
the
victory
to
strengthen
his
position
as
the
``
Most
Catholic
King
''
and
defender
of
Christendom
against
Muslim
incursion
.


Historian
Paul
K.
Davis
writes
that
,
``
More
than
a
military
victory
,
Lepanto
was
a
moral
one
.


For
decades
,
the
Ottoman
Turks
had
terrified
Europe
,
and
the
victories
of
Suleiman
the
Magnificent
caused
Christian
Europe
serious
concern
.


The
defeat
at
Lepanto
further
exemplified
the
rapid
deterioration
of
Ottoman
might
under
Selim
II
,
and
Christians
rejoiced
at
this
setback
for
the
Ottomans
.


The
mystique
of
Ottoman
power
was
tarnished
significantly
by
this
battle
,
and
Christian
Europe
was
heartened
.

Hurricane
Debbie
is
the
most
powerful
cyclone
on
record
to
strike
Ireland
in
September
,
and
possibly
the
only
tropical
cyclone
on
record
to
ever
strike
Britain
and
Ireland
while
still
tropical
.


The
fourth
named
storm
of
the
1961
Atlantic
hurricane
season
,
Debbie
originated
from
a
well-defined
tropical
disturbance
that
was
first
identified
in
late
August
over
Central
Africa
.


Tracking
generally
westward
,
the
system
moved
off
the
coast
of
Senegal
on
September
5
into
the
Atlantic
Ocean
.


By
this
time
,
it
was
estimated
to
have
become
a
tropical
storm
,
but
forecasters
did
not
issue
advisories
on
the
system
until
two
days
later
.


late
on
september
6
,
debbie
passed
through
the
southern
cape
verde
islands
as
a
strong
tropical
storm
or
minimal
hurricane
,
resulting
in
a
plane
crash
that
killed
60
people
in
the
islands
.


Once
clear
of
the
islands
,
data
on
the
storm
became
sparse
,
and
the
status
of
Debbie
was
uncertain
over
the
following
several
days
as
it
tracked
west-northwestward
and
later
northward
.


It
was
not
until
a
commercial
airliner
intercepted
the
storm
on
September
10
that
its
location
became
certain
.


The
following
day
,
Debbie
intensified
and
reached
its
peak
intensity
as
a
Category
3
hurricane
on
the
Saffir–Simpson
hurricane
scale
,
with
maximum
winds
of
120
mph
(
195
km/h
)
.


Maintaining
its
peak
intensity
for
over
a
day
,
the
hurricane
gradually
slowed
its
forward
motion
and
weakened
.


By
September
13
,
Debbie
's
motion
became
influenced
by
the
Westerlies
,
causing
the
system
to
accelerate
east-northeastward
.


The
system
passed
over
the
western
Azores
as
a
minimal
hurricane
on
September
15
.


at
this
point
,
there
is
uncertainty
as
to
the
structure
of
debbie
,
whether
it
transitioned
into
an
extratropical
cyclone
or
maintained
its
identity
as
a
tropical
system
.


Regardless
of
which
took
place
,
the
system
deepened
as
it
neared
Ireland
,
skirting
the
coast
of
Western
Ireland
on
September
16
.


Shortly
thereafter
,
the
system
was
confirmed
to
have
become
extratropical
as
it
continued
towards
the
northeast
.


The
remnants
of
the
storm
later
turned
eastward
,
striking
Norway
and
Russia
,
before
dissipating
on
September
19
.


Striking
Ireland
as
a
powerful
storm
,
Debbie
brought
record
winds
to
much
of
the
island
,
with
a
peak
gust
of
measured
just
offshore
.


These
winds
caused
widespread
damage
and
disruption
,
downing
tens
of
thousands
of
trees
and
power
lines
.


Countless
structures
sustained
varying
degrees
of
damage
,
with
many
smaller
buildings
destroyed
.


Agriculture
experienced
extensive
losses
to
barley
,
corn
and
wheat
crops
.


Throughout
Ireland
,
Debbie
killed
18
people
(
12
in
the
Republic
of
Ireland
and
six
in
Northern
Ireland
)
.


It
caused
US
$
40–50
million
in
damage
in
the
Republic
and
at
least
£1.5
million
(
US
$
4
million
)
in
Northern
Ireland
.


The
storm
also
battered
parts
of
Great
Britain
with
winds
in
excess
of
.


Typhoon
Dot
,
known
in
the
Philippines
as
Typhoon
Saling
,
was
the
strongest
storm
of
the
1985
season
.


Dot
originated
from
a
small
area
of
thunderstorm
activity
in
early
to
mid
October
.


The
system
was
first
classified
on
October
11
,
and
steadily
intensified
over
the
next
few
days
.


Dot
attained
typhoon
strength
on
October
15
,
and
subsequently
entered
a
period
of
explosive
deepening
,
which
was
not
anticipated
by
forecasters
.


The
next
day
the
intensification
rate
slowed
,
but
that
evening
,
Dot
attained
its
maximum
intensify
.


A
steady
weakening
trend
began
on
October
17
,
though
the
system
maintained
typhoon
intensity
through
the
passage
of
the
Philippines
.


After
entering
the
South
China
Sea
late

The
1991
Men
's
Ice
Hockey
World
Championships
was
the
55th
such
event
sanctioned
by
the
International
Ice
Hockey
Federation
(
IIHF
)
,
and
at
the
same
time
served
as
the
66th
and
last
Ice
Hockey
European
Championships
.


Teams
representing
25
countries
participated
in
several
levels
of
competition
.


The
competition
also
served
as
qualifications
for
group
placements
in
the
1992
competition
.


The
top
Championship
Group
A
tournament
took
place
in
Finland
from
19
April
to
4
May
1991
,
with
games
played
in
Turku
,
Helsinki
and
Tampere
.


Eight
teams
took
part
,
with
each
team
playing
each
other
once
.


The
four
best
teams
then
played
each
other
once
more
.


Sweden
became
world
champions
for
the
fifth
time
,
and
the
Soviet
Union
won
their
27th
European
title
.


In
the
European
Championships
,
only
matches
between
European
teams
in
the
first
round
were
counted
towards
scoring
.


There
were
three
significant
'lasts
'
in
this
year
's
championships
.


This
would
be
the
last
year
that
a
separate
European
title
would
be
awarded
,
which
the
Soviets
captured
in
their
last
appearance
before
the
dissolution
of
the
Soviet
Union
seven
months
later
.


Their
position
in
Group
A
would
be
inherited
by
Russia
,
while
newly
independent
former
Soviet
member
states
Belarus
,
Estonia
,
Kazakhstan
,
Latvia
,
Lithuania
,
and
Ukraine
began
play
in
1993
in
qualification
tournaments
for
Group
C.
The
tournament
itself
would
change
significantly
after
this
year
as
well
.


This
was
the
last
time
the
top
level
was
contested
by
eight
teams
;
beginning
in
1992
it
would
expand
to
twelve
,
requiring
both
Groups
B
and
C
to
promote
four
nations
each
.


The
final
round
of
four
teams
was
a
very
tight
battle
,
except
for
the
United
States
.


Getting
only
a
tie
against
the
last
place
Germans
,
the
Americans
only
advanced
to
the
final
round
by
narrowly
defeating
the
host
Finns
.


The
USA
were
easily
defeated
by
the
three
other
teams
in
the
final
round
,
but
were
involved
in
a
controversial
finish
.


The
Canadians
,
having
tied
both
the
Swedes
and
the
Soviets
,
needed
to
win
their
game
against
the
US
by
five
goals
,
then
hope
that
the
Swedes
and
Soviets
tied
,
ensuring
Canada
the
gold
.


Winning
7-4
in
the
final
minute
,
and
despite
playing
short-handed
,
they
miraculously
got
the
two
goals
they
needed
.


American
coach
Tim
Taylor
,
trailing
9-4
,
pulled
his
goalie
in
the
final
minute
,
later
claiming
that
he
was
trying
to
score
the
necessary
number
of
goals
to
win
the
bronze
medal
.


It
was
the
last
of
many
questionable
finishes
over
the
years
that
hastened
the
IIHF
to
change
the
format
of
the
tournament
.


The
Soviets
and
Swedes
took
a
1-1
tie
into
the
third
period
of
the
last
game
,
which
would
have
given
the
gold
medal
to
Canada
had
it
held
up
.


However
,
Mats
Sundin
scored
at
9:37
,
and
the
Swedes
held
on
to
capture
gold
.

The
September
1948
Florida
hurricane
was
the
most
intense
tropical
cyclone
to
make
landfall
in
the
state
since
the
1935
Labor
Day
hurricane
.


The
fourth
hurricane
and
third
major
hurricane
of
the
season
,
this
storm
developed
from
a
tropical
wave
over
the
Caribbean
Sea
on
September
18
.


Early
the
next
day
,
the
system
strengthened
into
a
hurricane
while
moving
westward
.


Thereafter
,
it
curved
northwestward
and
continued
to
deepen
.


By
September
20
,
the
system
turned
northward
and
later
that
day
made
landfall
in
Zapata
Peninsula
,
Cuba
as
a
Category
3
hurricane
on
the
modern
day
Saffir–Simpson
hurricane
wind
scale
.


Another
landfall
occurred
in
Cuba
early
the
next
day
to
the
south
of
Güines
.


Severe
destruction
was
reported
on
the
island
,
with
winds
up
to
observed
in
Havana
.


over
700
buildings
were
destroyed
.


Ten
deaths
occurred
and
damage
totaled
at
least
$
2
million
(
1948
USD
)
,
while
other
sources
estimate
``
several
million
dollars
.
''


After
emerging
into
the
Straits
of
Florida
on
September
21
,
the
storm
resumed
intensification
,
before
striking
near
Boca
Chica
Key
,
Florida
with
winds
of
120
mph
(
195
km/h
)
.


By
early
on
September
22
,
the
system
peaked
as
a
Category
4
hurricane
with
maximum
sustained
winds
of
130
mph
(
215
km/h
)
.


Shortly
thereafter
,
another
landfall
occurred
near
Chokoloskee
,
Florida
at
the
same
intensity
.


Severe
damage
was
reported
in
the
state
due
to
strong
winds
.


The
storm
was
considered
the
worst
in
Key
West
since
the
1919
Florida
Keys
hurricane
.


Throughout
the
state
,
1,200
homes
were
severely
damaged
or
destroyed
,
while
40
businesses
were
demolished
and
237
suffered
impact
.


Throughout
Florida
,
there
were
three
fatalities
and
approximately
$
12
million
(
1948
USD
)
in
damage
,
over
half
of
which
was
inflicted
on
crops
.


The
storm
rapidly
weakened
while
crossing
the
state
and
emerged
into
the
Atlantic
Ocean
as
only
a
Category
1
hurricane
later
on
September
22
.


Slight
fluctuations
in
intensity
occurred
before
the
hurricane
became
extratropical
early
on
September
24
,
while
located
northwest
of
Bermuda
.


The
Sunda
Strait
campaign
of
January
1794
was
a
series
of
manoeuvres
and
naval
actions
fought
between
warships
and
privateers
of
the
French
Republic
and
a
squadron
of
vessels
sent
by
the
British
East
India
Company
to
protect
trade
in
the
region
,
later
augmented
by
Dutch
warships
.


The
campaign
developed
as
French
forces
based
on
Île
de
France
reacted
more
quickly
than
the
British
forces
in
the
Indian
Ocean
to
the
expansion
of
the
French
Revolutionary
Wars
on
1
February
1793
.


French
privateers
rapidly
spread
along
the
British
trade
routes
in
the
Far
East
,
becoming
concentrated
around
the
narrow
Sunda
Strait
between
the
islands
of
Java
and
Sumatra
in
the
Dutch
East
Indies
.


These
ships
were
soon
joined
by
French
Navy
frigates
and
began
to
inflict
losses
on
shipping
in
the
region
.


The
Royal
Navy
forces
in
the
Indian
Ocean
were
deployed
elsewhere
and
so
the
East
India
Company
,
the
private
enterprise
that
ruled
much
of
British
India
in
the
1790s
and
maintained
their
own
fleet
and
navy
,
raised
a
squadron
of
armed
merchant
ships
to
patrol
the
Strait
and
drive
off
the
raiders
.


The
arrival
of
this
British
force
on
2
January
1794
was
initially
a
success
,
the
squadron
over-running
and
capturing
two
large
and
well-armed
privateers
on
22
January
,
not
long
after
the
French
vessels
had
been
beaten
off
during
an
attack
on
the
British
trading
post
at
Bencoolen
.


On
24
January
an
action
against
a
larger
French
squadron
was
fought
in
the
Strait
itself
,
but
ended
inconclusively
and
the
squadrons
divided
,
the
British
receiving
the
Dutch
frigate
``
Amazone
''
as
reinforcements
.


The
French
subsequently
turned
southwards
out
of
the
Strait
and
attacked
Bencoolen
again
on
9
February
,
capturing
an
East
Indiaman
in
the
harbour
before
returning
to
Île
de
France
with
their
prize
.


The
Jonesborough
ambush
took
place
on
20
March
1989
near
the
Irish
border
outside
the
village
of
Jonesborough
,
County
Armagh
,
Northern
Ireland
.


two
senior
royal
ulster
constabulary
(
ruc
)
officers
,
chief
superintendent
harry
breen
and
superintendent
bob
buchanan
,
were
shot
dead
in
an
ambush
by
the
provisional
ira
south
armagh
brigade
.


Breen
and
Buchanan
were
returning
from
an
informal
cross-border
security
conference
in
Dundalk
with
senior
Garda
officers
when
Buchanan
's
car
–
a
red
Vauxhall
Cavalier
—
was
flagged
down
and
fired
upon
by
six
IRA
gunmen
,
who
the
policemen
had
taken
for
British
soldiers
.


Buchanan
was
killed
outright
whilst
Breen
,
suffering
gunshot
wounds
,
was
deliberately
shot
in
the
back
of
the
head
after
he
had
left
the
car
waving
a
white
handkerchief
.


They
were
the
highest-ranking
RUC
officers
to
be
killed
during
the
Troubles
.


To
date
nobody
has
been
charged
with
killing
the
two
officers
.


There
have
been
allegations
that
the
attack
was
the
result
of
collusion
between
the
Gardaí
and
the
Provisional
IRA
.


Canadian
judge
Peter
Cory
investigated
the
killings
in
2003
;
his
findings
were
published
in
a
report
.


This
led
to
the
Irish
government
setting
up
the
Smithwick
Tribunal
,
a
judicial
inquiry
into
the
killings
which
opened
in
Dublin
in
June
2011
and
published
its
final
report
in
December
2013
.


In
the
report
Judge
Peter
Smithwick
stated
that
‘
on
balance
of
probability
’
,
somebody
inside
the
Dundalk
Garda
station
had
passed
on
information
to
the
IRA
regarding
the
presence
of
Breen
and
Buchanan
.


Hurricane
Belle
was
a
strong
tropical
cyclone
that
caused
moderate
damage
across
the
East
Coast
of
the
United
States
in
August
1976
.


In
late
July
,
a
tropical
wave
emerged
off
the
west
coast
of
Africa
.


Traversing
the
Atlantic
Ocean
for
more
than
a
week
,
the
system
eventually
consolidated
into
a
tropical
depression
near
the
Bahamas
on
August
6
.


Remaining
nearly
stationary
for
a
day
,
the
depression
strengthened
into
a
tropical
storm
on
August
7
and
a
hurricane
later
that
day
as
it
acquired
a
northwest
motion
.


Formation
of
an
eye
accompanied
quick
intensification
and
Belle
reached
its
peak
the
following
day
with
winds
of
120
mph
(
195
km/h
)
.


The
hurricane
subsequently
turned
north
and
accelerated
,
skirting
the
Outer
Banks
of
North
Carolina
.


Early
on
August
10
,
Belle
made
landfall
on
Long
Island
,
New
York
,
as
a
minimal
hurricane
crossing
Long
Island
Sound
and
hitting
the
central
coast
of
Connecticut
as
strong
tropical
storm
.


Thereafter
,
Belle
transitioned
into
an
extratropical
cyclone
over
New
England
before
moving
over
Atlantic
Canada
.


The
system
turned
east
while
over
the
north
Atlantic
and
ultimately
dissipated
on
August
15
to
the
south
of
Iceland
.

much
of
the
East
Coast
of
the
United
States
,
hurricane
warnings
were
issued
from
Georgia
to
Maine
.


An
estimated
500,000
people
evacuated
coastal
areas
accordingly
.


Overall
,
impacts
from
Belle
were
less
than
expected
and
mainly
attributed
to
flooding
across
New
England
.


Hundreds
of
thousands
of
residents
lost
power
due
to
high
winds
.


A
total
of
12
people
lost
their
lives
,
mostly
incidents
indirectly
related
to
the
hurricane
,
and
damage
reached
an
estimated
$
100
million
.


Portions
of
New
Jersey
,
New
York
,
and
Vermont
were
later
declared
major
disaster
areas
by
then-President
Gerald
Ford
.


Some
damage
also
took
place
in
New
Brunswick
,
Canada
,
from
heavy

The
1940
Louisiana
hurricane
caused
record
flooding
across
much
of
the
Southern
United
States
in
August
1940
.


The
second
tropical
cyclone
and
hurricane
of
the
annual
hurricane
season
,
it
formed
from
a
frontal
low
off
the
west
coast
of
Florida
on
August
3
.


Initially
a
weak
disturbance
,
it
moved
generally
westward
,
slowly
gaining
in
intensity
.


Early
on
August
4
,
the
depression
attained
tropical
storm
intensity
.


Ships
in
the
vicinity
of
the
storm
reported
a
much
stronger
tropical
cyclone
than
initially
suggested
.


After
reaching
hurricane
strength
on
August
5
south
of
the
Mississippi
River
Delta
,
the
storm
strengthened
further
into
a
Category
2
hurricane
with
maximum
sustained
winds
of
100
mph
and
a
minimum
barometric
pressure
of
972
mbar
(
hPa
;
28.71
inHg
)
at
0600
UTC
on
August
7
.


The
hurricane
moved
ashore
near
Sabine
Pass
,
Texas
later
that
day
at
peak
strength
.


Once
inland
,
the
storm
executed
a
sharp
curve
to
the
north
and
quickly
weakened
,
degenerating
into
a
tropical
storm
on
August
8
before
dissipating
over
Arkansas
on
August
10
.


Reports
of
a
potentially
destructive
hurricane
near
the
United
States
Gulf
Coast
forced
thousands
of
residents
in
low-lying
areas
to
evacuate
prior
to
the
storm
moving
inland
.


Offshore
,
the
hurricane
generated
rough
seas
and
a
strong
storm
surge
,
peaking
at
6.4
ft
(
1.95
m
)
on
the
western
edge
of
Lake
Pontchartrain
.


The
anomalously
high
tides
flooded
many
of
Louisiana
's
outlying
islands
,
inundating
resorts
.


Strong
winds
caused
moderate
infrastructural
damage
,
primarily
in
Texas
,
though
its
impact
was
mainly
to
communication
networks
along
the
US
Gulf
Coast
which
were
disrupted
by
the
winds
.


However
,
much
of
the
property
and
crop
damage
wrought
by
the
hurricane
was
due
to
the
torrential
rainfall
it
produced
in
low-lying
areas
,
setting
off
record
floods
.


Rainfall
peaked
at
37.5
in
(
953
mm
)
in
Miller
Island
off
Louisiana
,
making
it
the
wettest
tropical
cyclone
in
state
history
.


Nineteen
official
weather
stations
in
both
Texas
and
Louisiana
recorded
record-level
24-hour
rainfall
totals
for
the
month
of
August
as
a
result
of
the
slow-moving
hurricane
.


Property
,
livestock
,
and
crops–especially
cotton
,
corn
,
and
pecan
crops–were
heavily
damaged
.


Entire
ecosystems
were
also
altered
by
the
rainfall
.


Overall
,
the
storm
caused
$
10.75
million
in
damages
and
seven
fatalities
.


Hurricane
Gracie
was
a
major
hurricane
that
formed
in
September
1959
,
the
strongest
during
the
1959
Atlantic
hurricane
season
and
the
most
intense
to
strike
the
United
States
since
Hurricane
Hazel
in
1954
.


The
system
was
first
noted
as
an
area
of
thunderstorms
east
of
the
Lesser
Antilles
which
moved
just
north
of
the
Greater
Antilles
,
quickly
intensifying
into
a
hurricane
on
September
22
.


Gracie
was
a
storm
that
was
very
difficult
to
forecast
,
with
its
movement
unpredictable
.


After
five
days
of
erratic
motion
,
Gracie
became
a
major
hurricane
which
struck
South
Carolina
,
and
weakened
as
it
moved
up
the
Appalachians
,
bringing
much
needed
rain
to
a
drought-plagued
region
.


Much
of
the
destruction
related
with
Gracie
was
centered
on
Beaufort
,
South
Carolina
.


Gracie
became
an
extratropical
cyclone
on
September
30
while
moving
through
the

landfall
was
well-publicized
and
appropriate
preparations
were
made

The
storm
exited
land
and
started
strengthening
again
as
it
moved
into
the
South
China
Sea
.


The
system
turned
towards
China
's
Island
province
of
Hainan
where
a
yellow
alert
was
issued
and
heavy
to
very
heavy
rainfall
was
predicted
.


Fourteen
flights
from

.


The
system
again
exited
land
and
strengthened
as
it
curved
towards
Vietnam
.


On
approaching
land
,
the
system
and
its
remnants
affected
Laos
and
Thailand
.


The
storm
poured
extremely
heavy
rainfall
flooding
the
Yom
River
and
the
Nan
River
.


650,000
people
were
evacuated
from
low-lying
areas
as
some
6,200
acres
of
rice
and
other
crop
fields
were
reported
completely
submerged
.


Damages
were
expected
to
be

Nevertheless
,
the
earthquake
was
among
the
first
to

,
and
5,000

and
rain
.


A
large
cold
frontal
system
was
moving
onshore
,
and
on
the
north

heavy
flooding
was
destroying
homes

helicopter
had
already
been
lost
in
these
conditions

just
after
midnight
on
December

,
going
northwest
from
the
bay
,
flight
282
planned
to
head
out
over

to
circle
and
gain
altitude
,
then
travel
east
toward
its
destination
of
JFK
International

in
New

City
.


Shortly
after
takeoff
,
however
,
the
plane
veered
to
the
left
of
its
planned
course
.


The
pilot
,
Jabez
A.
Richards
,

determined
that
the
probable
cause
of

accident
was
that
the
pilot
,
for
undetermined
reasons
,
deviated
from
departure
course
into
an

On
July
16
,
2009
,
Harvard
University
professor
Henry
Louis
Gates
Jr.
was
arrested
at
his
Cambridge
,
Massachusetts
home
by
local
police
officer
Sgt
.


James
Crowley
,
who
was
responding
to
a
9-1-1
caller
's
report
of
men
breaking
and
entering
the
residence
.


The
arrest
initiated
a
series
of
events
that
unfolded
under
the
spotlight
of
the
international
news
media
.


The
arrest
occurred
just
after
Gates
returned
home
to
Cambridge
after
a
trip
to
China
to
research
the
ancestry
of
Yo-Yo
Ma
for
``
Faces
of
America
''
.


Gates
found
the
front
door
to
his
home
jammed
shut
and
,
with
the
help
of
his
driver
,
tried
to
force
it
open
.


A
local
witness
reported
their
activity
to
the
police
as
a
potential
burglary
in
progress
.


Accounts
regarding
the
ensuing
confrontation
differ
,
but
Gates
was
arrested
by
the
responding
officer
,
Cambridge
Police
Sgt
.


James
Crowley
,
and
charged
with
disorderly
conduct
.


On
July
21
,
the
charges
against
Gates
were
dropped
.


The
arrest
generated
a
national
debate
about
whether
or
not
it
represented
an
example
of
racial
profiling
by
police
.


On
July
22
,
President
Barack
Obama
said
about
the
incident
,
``
I
do
n't
know
,
not
having
been
there
and
not
seeing
all
the
facts
,
what
role
race
played
in
that
.


But
I
think
it
's
fair
to
say
,
number
one
,
any
of
us
would
be
pretty
angry
;
number
two
,
that
the
Cambridge
police
acted
stupidly
in
arresting
somebody
when
there
was
already
proof
that
they
were
in
their
own
home
,
and
,
number
three
,
what
I
think
we
know
separate
and
apart
from
this
incident
is
that
there
's
a
long
history
in
this
country
of
African
Americans
and
Latinos
being
stopped
by
law
enforcement
disproportionately
.
''


Law
enforcement
organizations
and
members
objected
to
Obama
's
comments
and
criticized
his
handling
of
the
issue
.


In
the
aftermath
,
Obama
stated
that
he
regretted
his
comments
and
hoped
that
the
situation
could

moment
''

on
july
24
,
obama
invited
both
parties
to
the
white
house
to
discuss
the
issue
over
beer
,
and
on
july
30
,
obama
and
vice
president
joe
biden
joined
crowley
and
gates
in
a
private
,
cordial
meeting
in
a
courtyard
near
the
white
house
rose
garden
;
this
became
known
colloquially
as
the
``
beer
summit
''
.


An
independent
panel
with
experts
from
across
the
nation
published
a
report
on
June
30
,
2010
,
which
states
that
``
Sergeant
Crowley
and
Professor
Gates
each
missed
opportunities
to
'ratchet
down
'
the
situation
and
end
it
peacefully
''
and
share
responsibility
for
the
controversial
July
16
arrest
.


Crowley
could
have
better
explained
how
uncertain
and
potentially
dangerous
it
is
to
respond
to
a
serious
crime-in-progress
call
and
why
this
can
result
in
a
seemingly
rude
tone
.


Gates
could
have
tried
to
understand
Crowley
's
view
of
the
situation
and
could
have
spoken
respectfully
to
Crowley
.


The
report
cites
research
that
shows
people
's
feelings
about
a
police
encounter
depend
significantly
on
whether
they
feel
the
officer
displays
respect
and
courtesy
.


The
Kerensky
Offensive
(
)
,
also
commonly
known
as
the
July
Offensive
(
)
or
Galician
Offensive
,
was
the
last
Russian
offensive
in
World
War
I
.


It
took
place
in
July
1917
.


It
was
decided
by
Alexander
Kerensky
,
Minister
of
War
in
the
Russian
provisional
government
,
and
led
by
General
Brusilov
.


Such
a
decision
was
ill-timed
,
because
,
following
the
February
Revolution
,
there
were
strong
popular
demands
for
peace
,
especially
within
the
Russian
Army
,
whose
fighting
capabilities
were
quickly
deteriorating
.


Discipline
within
the
Russian
Army
had
reached
a
point
of
crisis
since
the
Tsar
's
abdication
.


The
Petrograd
Soviet
's
``
Order
Number
1
''
tremendously
weakened
the
power
of
officers
,
giving
an
over-riding
mandate
to
``
soldier
committees
''
.


The
abolition
of
the
death
penalty
was
another
contributing
factor
,
as
was
the
high
presence
of
revolutionary
agitators
at
the
front
including
Bolshevik
agitators
,
who
promoted
a
defeatist
agenda
(
and
whom
Kerensky
tolerated
considerably
more
than
conservative
agitators
)
.


Riots
and
mutineering
at
the
front
became
common
,
officers
were
often
the
victims
of
soldier
harassment
and
even
murder
.


Furthermore
,
the
policy
of
the
new
government
towards
the
war
effort
was
one
of
fulfilling
obligations
towards
Russia
's
allies
,
as
opposed
to
fighting
for
the
sake
of
total
victory
,
thus
giving
soldiers
a
less
credible
motivation
to
fight
.


However
,
Kerensky
hoped
that
an
important
Russian
victory
would
gain
popular
favour
and
restore
the
soldiers
'
morale
,
thus
strengthening
the
weak
provisional
government
and
proving
the
effectiveness
of
``
the
most
democratic
army
in
the
world
''
,
as
he
referred
to
it
.


Starting
on
July
1
,
1917
the
Russian
troops
attacked
the
Austro-Germans
in
Galicia
,
pushing
toward
Lviv
.


The
operations
involved
the
Russian
11th
,
7th
and
8th
Armies
and
the
Austro-German
South
Army
(
General
von
Bothmer
)
and
the
Austrian
7th
and
3rd
Armies
.


After
an
initial
success
,
the
offensive
was
halted
because
the
Russian
soldiers
soon
mutinied
and
refused
to
fight
.


It
collapsed
altogether
by
July
16
.


On
the
18th
the
Austro-Germans
counterattacked
,
meeting
little
resistance
and
advancing
through
Galicia
and
Ukraine
until
the
Zbruch
River
.


The
Russian
lines
were
broken
on
the
20th
,
and
by
the
23rd
,
the
Russians
had
retreated
about
240
kilometres
(
150
miles
)
.


The
Russian
provisional
government
was
greatly
weakened
by
this
military
catastrophe
,
and
the
possibility
of
a
Bolshevik
coup
d'état
became
increasingly
real
.


Far
from
strengthening
Russian
army
morale
,
this
offensive
proved
that
Russian
army
morale
no
longer
existed
.


No
Russian
general
could
now
count
on
the
soldiers
under
his
command
actually
doing
what
they
were
ordered
to
do
.


This
offensive
also
helped
the
start
of
the
July
Days
.


One
last
fight
took
place
between
the
Germans
and
the
Russians
in
this
war
.


On
September
1
,
1917
the
Germans
attacked
and
captured
Riga
.


The
Russian
soldiers
defending
the
town
refused
to
fight
and
fled
from
the
advancing
German
troops
.


the
people
power
revolution
(
also
known
as
the
edsa
revolution
,
the
philippine
revolution
of
1986
,
edsa
1986
,
edsa
i
and
edsa
people
power
)
was
a
series
of
popular
demonstrations
in
the
philippines
,
mostly
in
metro
manila
from
february
unk
,
1986
.


There
was
a
sustained
campaign
of
civil
resistance
against
regime
violence
and
alleged
electoral
fraud
.


The
nonviolent
revolution
led
to
the
departure
of
Ferdinand
Marcos
,
the
end
of
his
21-year
presidential
rule
,
and
the
restoration
of
democracy
in
the
Philippines
.


it
is
also
referred
to
as
the
yellow
revolution
due
to
the
presence
of
yellow
ribbons
during
demonstrations
following
the
assassination
of
filipino
senator
benigno
``
ninoy
''
aquino
,
jr.
in
august
1983
.


It
was
widely
seen
as
a
victory
of
the
people
against
two
decades
of
presidential
rule
by
President
Marcos
,
and
made
news
headlines
as
``
the
revolution
that
surprised
the
world
''
.


The
majority
of
the
demonstrations
took
place
on
a
long
stretch
of
Epifanio
de
los
Santos
Avenue
,
more
commonly
known
by
its
acronym
``
EDSA
''
,
in
Metro
Manila
from
February
22–25
,
1986
.


They
involved
over
two
million
Filipino
civilians
,
as
well
as
several
political
and
military
groups
,
and
religious
groups
led
by
Cardinal
Jaime
Sin
,
the
Archbishop
of
Manila
,
along
with
Catholic
Bishops
'
Conference
of
the
Philippines
President
Cardinal
Ricardo
Vidal
,
the
Archbishop
of
Cebu
.


The
protests
,
fueled
by
the
resistance
and
opposition
from
years
of
governance
by
President
Marcos
and
his
cronies
,
culminated
with
the
absolute
ruler
and
his
family
fleeing
Malacañang
Palace
to
exile
in
Hawaii
.


Ninoy
Aquino
's
widow
,
Corazon
Aquino
,
was
immediately
installed
as
the
eleventh
President
as
a
result
of
the
revolution
.


The
Siachen
conflict
,
sometimes
referred
to
as
the
Siachen
War
,
was
a
military
conflict
between
India
and
Pakistan
over
the
disputed
Siachen
Glacier
region
in
Kashmir
.


A
cease-fire
went
into
effect
in
2003
.


The
contended
area
is
nearly
of
territory
.


The
conflict
was
started
in
1984
by
India
's
successful
capture
of
the
Siachen
Glacier
as
part
of
Operation
``
Meghdoot
''
.


India
took
control
of
the
Siachen
Glacier
and
its
tributary
glaciers
,
as
well
as
all
the
main
passes
and
heights
of
the
Saltoro
Ridge
immediately
west
of
the
glacier
,
including
Sia
La
,
Bilafond
La
,
and
Gyong
La
.


Pakistan
controls
the
glacial
valleys
immediately
west
of
the
Saltoro
Ridge
.


According
to
``
TIME
''
magazine
,
India
gained
more
than
of
territory
because
of
its
military
operations
in
Siachen
.


The
Jewish–Roman
wars
were
a
series
of
large-scale
revolts
by
the
Jews
of
the
Eastern
Mediterranean
against
the
Roman
Empire
between
66
and
135
CE
.


While
the
First
Jewish–Roman
War
(
66–73
CE
)
and
the
Bar
Kokhba
revolt
(
132–136
CE
)
were
nationalist
rebellions
,
striving
to
restore
an
independent
Judean
state
,
the
Kitos
War
was
more
of
an
ethno-religious
conflict
,
mostly
fought
outside
the
Judea
Province
.


Hence
,
some
sources
use
the
term
Jewish-Roman
Wars
to
refer
only
to
the
First
Jewish–Roman
War
(
66–73
CE
)
and
the
Bar
Kokhba
revolt
(
132–135
CE
)
,
while
others
include
the
Kitos
War
(
115–117
CE
)
as
one
of
the
Jewish–Roman
wars
.


The
Jewish–Roman
wars
had
a
dramatic
impact
on
the
Jewish
people
,
turning
them
from
a
major
population
in
the
Eastern
Mediterranean
into
a
scattered
and
persecuted
minority
.


The
Jewish–Roman
wars
are
often
cited
as
a
disaster
to
Jewish
society
.


The
events
also
had
a
major
impact
on
Judaism
,
after
the
central
worship
site
of
Second
Temple
Judaism
,
the
Second
Temple
in
Jerusalem
,
was
destroyed
by
Titus
'
troops
.


although

a
sort
of

century
and
later

limited
success
in
establishing
the
short-lived
sasanian
jewish
autonomy
in
jerusalem
in

,
jewish
dominance
in
parts
of
the
southern
levant
was
regained

Operation
Vistula
(
)
was
a
codename
for
the
1947
forced
resettlement
of
the
Ukrainian
minority
as
well
as
Boykos
and
Lemkos
from
the
south-eastern
provinces
of
post-war
Poland
,
to
the
Recovered
Territories
in
the
west
of
the
country
.


The
action
was
carried
out
by
the
Soviet-installed
Polish
communist
authorities
with
the
aim
of
removing
material
support
and
assistance
to
the
Ukrainian
Insurgent
Army
.


The
Ukrainian
Insurgent
Army
continued
its
guerilla
activities
until
1947
in
both
Subcarpathian
and
Lublin
Voivodeships
with
no
hope
for
any
peaceful
resolution
.


Operation
Vistula
effectively
brought
an
end
to
the
hostilities
.


in
a
period
of
three
months
beginning
on
28
april
1947
and
with
soviet
approval
and
aid
,
about
141,000
civilians
residing
around
bieszczady
and
low
beskids
were
forcibly
resettled
to
formerly
german
territories
,
ceded
to
poland
at
the
yalta
conference
at
the
end
of
world
war
ii
.


The
operation
was
named
after
the
Vistula
River
,
``
Wisła
''
in
Polish
.


Some
Polish
and
Ukrainian
politicians
as
well
as
historians
condemned
the
operation
following
the
1989
fall
of
communism
in
Eastern
Europe
,
and
described
it
as
ethnic
cleansing
.


Others
pointed
out
that
no
other
means
of
stopping
the
violence
existed
at
the
time
since
partisans
used
to
regroup
outside
the
Polish
borders
.


During
Operation
Vistula
the
conditions
of
the
United
Nations
Charter
of
26
June
1945
,
on
the
right
of
self-determination
and
international
laws
,
were
respected
.


The
deported
farmers
received
financial
help
from
the
Polish
government
and
took
over
homes
and
farms
left
behind
by
the
Germans
,
in
some
cases
experiencing
an
improvement
in
their
living
conditions
as
a
result
of
the
increased
size
of
the
newly
acquired
properties
,
their
brick
construction
,
and
the
provision
of
running
water
.


In
the
years
1956
to
1958
they
received
mostly
non-repayable
credits
totalling
170
million
PLN
which
was
a
considerable
amount
of
money
in
the
Polish
national
budget
.


At
exactly
the
same
time
the
Soviet
Union
carried
out
a
parallel
operation
,
dubbed
``
Operation
West
''
,
in
the
Ukrainian
SSR
by
the
Soviet
Union
at
exactly
the
same
time
.


although
both
operations
were
coordinated
from
moscow
,
there
was
a
shocking
difference
between
their
outcomes
.


Operation
West
was
conducted
in
West
Ukraine
by
the
Soviet
NKVD
and
targeted
the
families
of
suspected
UPA
members
.


over
114,000
individuals
,
mostly
women
and
children
,
were
deported
to
the
kazakh
ssr
and
siberia
and
forced
into
extreme
poverty
.


Of
the
19,000
adult
males
deported
by
the
NKVD
deportees
,
most
were
sent
to
coal
mines
and
stone
quarries
in
the
north
.


None
of
the
people
deported
by
the
NKVD
received
any
farms
or
empty
homes
to
live
in
.


the
second
edsa
revolution
(
edsa
ii
or
edsa
dos
)
was
a
three-day
political
protest
from
january
unk
,
2001
that
peacefully
overthrew
the
government
of
joseph
estrada
,
the
thirteenth
president
of
the
philippines
.


Estrada
resigned
and
was
succeeded
by
his
Vice-President
,
Gloria
Macapagal-Arroyo
,
who
was
sworn
into
office
by
then-Chief
Justice
Hilario
Davide
Jr.
at
around
noon
on
January
20
,
2001
,
several
hours
before
Estrada
fled
Malacañang
Palace
.


EDSA
is
an
acronym
derived
from
Epifanio
de
los
Santos
Avenue
,
the
major
thoroughfare
connecting
five
cities
in
Metro
Manila
,
namely
Pasay
,
Makati
,
Mandaluyong
,
Quezon
City
,
and
Caloocan
,
with
the
revolution
's
epicentre
at
the
EDSA
Shrine
church
at
the
northern
tip
of
Ortigas
Center
,
a
business
district
.


Advocates
described
EDSA
II
as
``
popular
''
but
critics
view
the
uprising
as
a
conspiracy
among
political
and
business
elites
,
military
top
brass
and
Catholic
Cardinal
Jaime
Sin
.


International
reaction
to
the
revolt
was
mixed
,
with
some
foreign
nations
including
the
United
States
immediately
recognising
the
legitimacy
of
Arroyo
's
presidency
,
and
foreign
commentators
describing
it
as
``
a
defeat
for
due
process
of
law
''
,
``
mob
rule
''
,
and
a
``
''
de
facto
''
coup
''
.


The
only
means
of
legitimizing
the
event
was
the
last-minute
Supreme
Court
ruling
that
``
the
welfare
of
the
people
is
the
supreme
law
.
''


but
by
then
,
the
armed
forces
of
the
philippines
had
already
withdrawn
support
for
the
president
,
which
some
analysts
called
unconstitutional
,
and
most
foreign
political
analysts
agreeing
with
this
assessment
.


William
Overholt
,
a
Hong
Kong-based
political
economist
said
that
``
It
is
either
being
called
mob
rule
or
mob
rule
as
a
cover
for
a
well-planned
coup
,
...
but
either
way
,
it
's
not
democracy
.
''


It
should
also
be
noted
that
opinion
was
divided
during
EDSA
II
about
whether
Gloria
Macapagal-Arroyo
as
the
incumbent
Vice
President
should
be
President
if
Joseph
Estrada
was
ousted
;
many
groups
who
participated
in
EDSA
II
expressly
stated
that
they
did
not
want
Arroyo
for
president
either
,
and
some
of
them
would
later
participate
in
EDSA
III
.


The
prevailing
Constitution
of
the
Philippines
calls
for
the
Vice
President
of
the
Philippines
,
Arroyo
at
the
time
,
to
act
as
interim
president
only
when
the
sitting
President
dies
,
resigns
,
or
becomes
incapacitated
,
none
of
which
occurred
during
EDSA
II
.


On
October
4
,
2000
,
Ilocos
Sur
Governor
Luis
``
Chavit
''
Singson
,
a
longtime
friend
of
President
Joseph
Estrada
,
went
public
with
accusations
that
Estrada
,
his
family
and
friends
received
millions
of
pesos
from
operations
of
the
illegal
numbers
game
,
``
jueteng
''
.


The
exposé
immediately
ignited
reactions
of
rage
.


The
next
day
,
Senate
Minority
Leader
Teofisto
Guingona
,
Jr.
delivered
a
fiery
privilege
speech
accusing
Estrada
of
receiving
P220
million
in
jueteng
money
from
Governor
Singson
from
November
1998
to
August
2000
,
as
well
as
taking
P70
million
on
excise
tax
on
cigarettes
intended
for
Ilocos
Sur
.


The
privilege
speech
was
referred
by
Senate
President
Franklin
Drilon
,
to
the
Blue
Ribbon
Committee
and
the
Committee
on
Justice
for
joint
investigation
.


another
committee
in
the
house
of
representatives
decided
to
investigate
the
UNK
,
while
other
house
members
spearheaded
a
move
to
impeach
the
president
.


More
calls
for
resignation
came
from
Manila
Cardinal
Archbishop
Jaime
Sin
,
the
Catholic
Bishops
Conference
of
the
Philippines
,
former
Presidents
Corazon
Aquino
and
Fidel
Ramos
,
and
Vice
President
Gloria
Macapagal-Arroyo
(
who
had
resigned
her
cabinet
position
of
Secretary
of
the
Department
of
Social
Welfare
and
Development
)
.


Cardinal
Sin
stated
in
a
statement
``
In
the
light
of
the
scandals
that
besmirched
the
image
of
presidency
,
in
the
last
two
years
,
we
stand
by
our
conviction
that
he
has
lost
the
moral

The
Second
Sino-Japanese
War
was
a
military
conflict
fought
primarily
between
the
Republic
of
China
and
the
Empire
of
Japan
from
July
7
,
1937
,
to
September
2
,
1945
.


It
began
with
the
Marco
Polo
Bridge
Incident
in
1937
in
which
a
dispute
between
Japanese
and
Chinese
troops
escalated
into
a
battle
.


Some
sources
in
the
modern
People
's
Republic
of
China
date
the
beginning
of
the
war
to
the
Japanese
invasion
of
Manchuria
in
1931
.


it
is
known
as
the
war
of
resistance
(
;
lit
.


``
chinese
war
of
resistance
against
japan
''
)
in
china
.


China
fought
Japan
with
aid
from
the
Soviet
Union
and
the
United
States
.


After
the
Japanese
attack
on
Pearl
Harbor
in
1941
,
the
war
merged
with
other
conflicts
of
World
War
II
as
a
major
sector
known
as
the
China
Burma
India
Theater
.


Some
scholars
consider
the
start
of
the
full-scale
Second
Sino-Japanese
War
in
1937
to
have
been
the
beginning
of
World
War
II
.


The
Second
Sino-Japanese
War
was
the
largest
Asian
war
in
the
20th
century
.


It
accounted
for
the
majority
of
civilian
and
military
casualties
in
the
Pacific
War
,
with
between
10
and
25
million
Chinese
civilians
and
over
4
million
Chinese
and
Japanese
military
personnel
dying
from
war-related
violence
,
famine
,
and
other
causes
.


The
war
was
the
result
of
a
decades-long
Japanese
imperialist
policy
to
expand
its
influence
politically
and
militarily
in
order
to
secure
access
to
raw
material
reserves
,
food
,
and
labor
.


The
period
after
World
War
I
brought
about
increasing
stress
on
the
Japanese
polity
.


Leftists
sought
universal
suffrage
and
greater
rights
for
workers
.


Increasing
textile
production
from
Chinese
mills
was
adversely
affecting
Japanese
production
.


The
Great
Depression
brought
about
a
large
slowdown
in
exports
.


All
of
this
contributed
to
militant
nationalism
,
culminating
in
the
rise
to
power
of
a
militarist
fascist
faction
.


this
faction
was
led
at
its
height
by
the
hideki
tojo
cabinet
of
the
imperial
rule
assistance
association
under
edict
from
emperor
hirohito
.


In
1931
,
the
Mukden
Incident
helped
spark
the
Japanese
invasion
of
Manchuria
.


The
Chinese
were
defeated
and
Japan
created
a
new
puppet
state
,
Manchukuo
;
many
historians
cite
1931
as
the
beginning
of
the
war
.


This
view
has
been
adopted
by
the
PRC
government
.


From
1931
to
1937
,
China
and
Japan
continued
to
skirmish
in
small
,
localized
engagements
,
so-called
``
incidents
''
.


Initially
the
Japanese
scored
major
victories
,
capturing
Beijing
,
Shanghai
and
the
Chinese
capital
of
Nanjing
in
1937
.


After
failing
to
stop
the
Japanese
in
the
Battle
of
Wuhan
,
the
Chinese
central
government
was
relocated
to
Chongqing
(
Chungking
)
in
the
Chinese
interior
.


By
1939
,
after
Chinese
victories
in
Changsha
and
Guangxi
,
and
with
Japan
's
lines
of
communications
stretched
deep
into
the
Chinese
interior
,
the
war
reached
a
stalemate
.


The
Japanese
were
also
unable
to
defeat
the
Chinese
communist
forces
in
Shaanxi
,
which
waged
a
campaign
of
sabotage
and
guerrilla
warfare
against
the
invaders
.


While
Japan
ruled
the
large
cities
,
they
lacked
sufficient
manpower
to
control
China
's
vast
countryside
.


During
this
time
,
Chinese
communist
forces
launched
a
counter
offensive
in
Central
China
while
Chinese
nationalist
forces
launched
a
large
scale
winter
offensive
.


On
December
7
,
1941
,
the
Japanese
attacked
Pearl
Harbor
,
and
the
following
day
the
United
States
declared
war
on
Japan
.


The
United
States
began
to
aid
China
by
airlifting
material
over
the
Himalayas
after
the
Allied
defeat
in
Burma
that
closed
the
Burma
Road
.


In
1944
Japan
launched
the
invasion
,
Operation
Ichi-Go
,
that
conquered
Henan
and
Changsha
.


However
,
this
failed
to
bring
about
the
surrender
of
Chinese
forces
.


In
1945
,
the
Chinese
Expeditionary
Force
resumed
its
advance
in
Burma
and
completed
the
Ledo
Road
linking
India
to
China
.


at
the
same
time
,
china
launched
large
counteroffensives
in
south
china
and
retook
west
hunan
and
guangxi
.


Despite
continuing
to
occupy
part
of
China
's
territory
,
Japan
eventually
surrendered
on
September
2
,
1945
,
to
Allied
forces
following
the
atomic
bombings
of
Hiroshima
and
Nagasaki
and
the
Soviet
invasion
of
Japanese-held
Manchuria
.


The
remaining
Japanese
occupation
forces
(
excluding
Manchuria
)
formally
surrendered
on
September
9
,
1945
,
with
the
following
International
Military
Tribunal
for
the
Far
East
convened
on
April
29
,
1946
.


at
the
outcome
of
the
cairo
conference
of
november
unk
,
1943
,
the
allies
of
world
war
ii
decided
to
restrain
and
punish
the
aggression
of
japan
by
restoring
all
the
territories
that
japan
annexed
from
china
,
including
manchuria
,
unk
,
and
the
pescadores
,
to
china
,
and
to
expel
japan
from
the
korean
peninsula
.


China
was
recognized
as
one
of
the
Big
Four
of
the
Allies
during
the
war
and
became
one
of
the
five
permanent
members
of
the
United
Nations
Security
Council
.


The
Istanbul
pogrom
,
also
known
as
the
Istanbul
riots
or
September
events
(
``
Septemvriana
''
,
``
Events
of
September
''
;
,
``
Events
of
September
6–7
''
)
,
were
organized
mob
attacks
directed
primarily
at
Istanbul
's
Greek
minority
on
6–7
September
1955
.


the
riots
were
orchestrated
by
the
tactical
mobilisation
group
,
the
special
operations
unit
of
the
turkish
army
set
up
as
operation
gladio
's
turkish
branch
;
the
counter-guerrilla
(
another
operation
unk
organisation
)
,
and
the
national
security
service
,
the
precursor
of
today
's
national
intelligence
organisation
.


The
events
were
triggered
by
the
false
news
that
the
day
before
,
Greeks
had
bombed
the
Turkish
consulate
in
Thessaloniki
,
in
northern
Greece—the
house
where
Mustafa
Kemal
Atatürk
had
been
born
in
1881
.


A
bomb
planted
by
a
Turkish
usher
at
the
consulate
,
who
was
later
arrested
and
confessed
,
incited
the
events
.


The
Turkish
press
,
conveying
the
news
in
Turkey
,
was
silent
about
the
arrest
and
instead
insinuated
that
Greeks
had
set
off
the
bomb
.


A
Turkish
mob
,
most
of
which
had
been
trucked
into
the
city
in
advance
,
assaulted
Istanbul
's
Greek
community
for
nine
hours
.


although
the
mob
did
not
explicitly
call
for
greeks
to
be
killed
,
over
a
dozen
people
died
during
or
after
the
attacks
as
a
result
of
beatings
and
arson
.


Armenians
and
Jews
were
also
harmed
.


The
police
remained
mostly
ineffective
,
and
the
violence
continued
until
the
government
declared
martial
law
in
İstanbul
and
called
in
the
army
to
put
down
the
riots
.


The
pogrom
greatly
accelerated
emigration
of
ethnic
Greeks
from
Turkey
,
and
the
Istanbul
region
in
particular
.


The
Greek
population
of
Turkey
declined
from
119,822
persons
in
1927
,
to
about
7,000
in
1978
.


In
Istanbul
alone
,
the
Greek
population
decreased
from
65,108
to
49,081
between
1955
and
1960
.


The
2008
figures
released
by
the
Turkish
Foreign
Ministry
placed
the
number
of
Turkish
citizens
of
Greek
descent
at
3,000–4,000
;
while
according
to
the
Human
Rights
Watch
(
2006
)
their
number
was
estimated
to
be
2,500
.


Some
see
the
attacks
as
a
continuation
of
a
process
of
Turkification
that
started
with
the
decline
of
the
Ottoman
Empire
,
rather
than
being
a
contemporary
,
bilateral
issue
.


To
back
this
claim
they
adduce
the
fact
that
roughly
40
%
of
the
properties
attacked
belonged
to
other
minorities
.


The
pogrom
has
been
compared
in
some
media
to
the
``
Kristallnacht
''
,
the
1938
pogrom
against
Jews
throughout
Nazi
Germany
.


Historian
Alfred-Maurice
de
Zayas
has
written
that
in
his
view
,
despite
the
small
number
of
deaths
in
the
pogrom
,
the
riots
met
the
``
intent
to
destroy
in
whole
or
in
part
''
criterion
of
the
Genocide
Convention
.


The
Java
War
or
Diponegoro
War
was
fought
in
central
Java
from
1825
–
1830
,
between
the
colonial
Dutch
Empire
and
native
Javanese
rebels
.


The
war
started
as
a
rebellion
led
by
Prince
Diponegoro
,
a
leading
member
of
the
Javanese
aristocracy
who
had
previously
cooperated
with
the
Dutch
.


The
rebel
forces
laid
siege
to
Yogyakarta
,
a
move
that
prevented
a
quick
victory
.


This
gave
the
Dutch
time
to
reinforce
their
army
with
colonial
and
European
troops
,
allowing
them
to
end
the
siege
in
1825
.


After
this
defeat
,
the
rebels
continued
fighting
a
guerrilla
war
for
five
years
.


The
war
ended
in
a
Dutch
victory
,
and
Prince
Diponegoro
was
invited
to
a
peace
conference
.


He
was
betrayed
and
captured
.


Due
to
the
cost
of
the
war
,
Dutch
colonial
authorities
implemented
major
reforms
throughout
the
Dutch
East
Indies
to
ensure
the
colonies
remained
profitable
.


the
2011
halloween
nor'easter
,
sometimes
referred
to
as
``
unk
,
''
``
unk
,
''
``
storm
alfred
,
''
and
``
unk
,
''
was
a
large
low
pressure
area
that
produced
unusually
early
snowfall
across
the
northeastern
united
states
and
the
canadian
maritimes
.


It
formed
early
on
October
29
along
a
cold
front
to
the
southeast
of
the
Carolinas
.


As
it
moved
up
the
East
Coast
,
its
associated
snowfall
broke
records
in
at
least
20
cities
for
total
accumulations
,
resulting
in
a
rare
``
white
Halloween
''
two
days
later
.


The
storm
arrived
just
two
months
after
Hurricane
Irene
caused
extensive
power
outages
and
property
damage
in
the
Northeast
;
with
the
2011
New
England
tornado
outbreak
also
causing
damage
in
Western
Massachusetts
.


It
dumped
snow
on
trees
that
were
often
still
in
leaf
,
adding
extra
weight
,
with
the
ground
in
some
areas
still
soft
from
a
preceding
warm
,
rainy
period
that
increased
the
possibility
trees
could
be
uprooted
.


Trees
and
branches
that
collapsed
caused
considerable
damage
,
particularly
to
power
lines
,
with
estimates
of
storm
costs
ranging
between
$
1
billion
and
$
3
billion
.


In
all
,
3.2
million
U.S.
residences
and
businesses
in
12
states
experienced
power
outages
,
with
the
storm
also
impacting
three
Canadian
provinces
.


Some
customers
in
Connecticut
did
not
get
power
back
until
early
November
;
many
outages
lasted
11
days
Many
communities
chose
to
postpone
celebrations
of
Halloween
from
two
days
to
a
week
later
as
a
result
,
or
cancel
them
entirely
.


Delays
in
restoring
power
led
to
the
resignation
of
the
chief
operating
officer
of
Connecticut
Light
&
Power
amid
widespread
criticism
of
the
company
's
mishandling
of
both
the
nor'easter
and
Irene
.


The
Samarrah
Offensive
(
March
13
–
April
23
,
1917
)
was
launched
by
the
British
against
the
Ottomans
as
part
of
the
Mesopotamian
Campaign
in
World
War
I
.


After
Baghdad
fell
to
the
British
on
March
11
,
1917
,
there
were
still
10,000
Ottoman
troops
north
of
the
city
,
led
by
Khalil
Pasha
,
who
could
represent
a
threat
to
Anglo-Indian
forces
.


Furthermore
,
another
15,000
Ottomans
under
Ali
Ihsan
Bey
were
being
driven
out
of
Persia
by
the
Russians
,
and
were
attempting
at
joining
Khalil
's
forces
in
northern
Iraq
.


The
British
commander
,
Frederick
Stanley
Maude
,
decided
that
,
in
order
to
avert
these
threats
,
he
had
to
take
control
of
the
Samarrah
railroad
,
running
north
of
Baghdad
.


Operations
began
on
March
13
,
carried
forth
by
45,000
British
troops
.


On
March
19
,
they
conquered
Fallujah
,
a
crucial
step
toward
the
offensive
's
goal
.


The
British
continued
their
attacks
until
April
23
,
when
the
town
of
Samarrah
and
its
railroad
fell
into
their
hands
.


although
it
achieved
its
aims
,
the
unk
offensive
cost
the
british
about
18,000
casualties
,
a
considerable
price
(

numerous
monthly
rainfall
records
in
parts
of
the
Goldfields-Esperance
regions
of
Western
Australia
,
dropping
up
to
of

in
February
1995
.


The
fourth
named
storm
of
the
1994–95
Australian

cyclone
season
,
Bobby
developed
as
a
tropical
low
embedded
within
a
monsoon
trough
situated
north
of
the
Northern
Territory
coastline
on
19
February
.


The
storm
gradually
drifted
southwestward
and
later
southward
under
low
wind
shear
,
strengthening
enough
to
be
assigned
the
name
``
Bobby
''
by
the
Australian
Bureau
of
Meteorology
(
BoM
)
.


The
storm
rapidly
deepened
as
it
approached
the
coast
of
Western
Australia
,
and
attained
its
peak
intensity
of
925
mbar
(
hPa
;
27.32

)
at
0900
UTC
on
24
February
with
10-minute
maximum
sustained
winds
of
195
km/h
(
120
mph
)
.


After
making
landfall
as
a
somewhat
weaker
cyclone
near
Onslow
,
the
remnants
of
Bobby
drifted
southeastward
,
gradually
weakening
,
before
dissipating
over
the
southern
reaches
of
Western
Australia
.


Bobby
inflicted
minor
damage
throughout
Western
Australia
,
dropping
copious
rainfall
and
forcing
the
closure
of
many
facilities
and
roads
.


The
storm
's
destruction
was
most
severe
in
Onslow
,
where
20
residences
suffered
damage
.


Elsewhere
,
Bobby
knocked
out
power
and
water
supplies
,
unroofed
houses
,
tore
off
rain
gutters
,
toppled
fences
,
and
smashed
windows
.


The
flooding
of
a
stretch
of
the
Eyre
Highway
stranded
approximately
1000
vehicles
,
although
the
backup
was
later
cleared
more
than
a
week
later
.


Flooding
disrupted
mining
and
drilling
operations
throughout
southwestern
Australia
,
costing
the
industry
upwards
of
$
50
million
(
1995
AUD
;
$
38.7
million
USD
)
.


numerous
australian

efforts
after
the
cyclone
's
passage
,
while
power
and
water
service
was
restored
to
those
cut
off
during

Overall
,
the
cyclone
caused
eight

a
benefit
concert
that
took
place
at
Madison
Square
Garden
in
New
York
City
on
December
12
,
2012
.


The
concert
was
held
in
response
to
Hurricane
Sandy
,
which
devastated
portions
of
the
Northeastern
United
States
,
the
Caribbean
and
the
Mid-Atlantic
in
late
October
2012
and
cost
an
estimated

.


The
concert
was
broadcast
live
via
television
,
radio
,
movie
theaters
and
the
Internet
,
and
released
on
DVD
and
CD
.


A
documentary
film
was
also
made
about
the
concert
.


Proceeds
from
the
event
were
collected
by
the
Robin
Hood
Relief
Fund
to
benefit
victims
of
the
hurricane
in
New
York
,
New
Jersey
and
Connecticut
.


Many
famous

Operation
Rösselsprung
(
Knight
's
move
)
was
a
combined
airborne
and
ground
assault
by
the
German
XV
Mountain
Corps
and
their
allies
on
the
Supreme
Headquarters
of
the
Yugoslav
Partisans
located
in
the
Bosnian
town
of
Drvar
in
the
Independent
State
of
Croatia
during
World
War
II
.


The
operation
was
launched
on
25
May
1944
,
and
was
aimed
at
capturing
or
killing
the
Partisan
leader
Marshal
Josip
Broz
Tito
and
destroying
the
headquarters
,
support
facilities
and
co-located
Allied
military
missions
.


It
is
associated
with
the
Seventh
Enemy
Offensive
(
)
in
Yugoslav
history
,
forming
part
of
the
Seven
Enemy
Offensives
historiographical
framework
.


The
airborne
assault
itself
is
also
known
as
the
Raid
on
Drvar
(
)
.


Operation
Rösselsprung
was
a
coup
de
main
operation
,
involving
direct
action
by
a
combined
parachute
and
glider-borne
assault
by
the
500th
SS
Parachute
Battalion
and
a
planned
subsequent
link-up
with
ground
forces
of
the
XV
Mountain
Corps
converging
on
Drvar
.


The
airborne
assault
was
preceded
by
heavy
bombing
of
the
town
by
the
Luftwaffe
.


The
ground
forces
included
Home
Guard
forces
of
the
Independent
State
of
Croatia
along
with
collaborationist
Chetniks
.


Tito
,
his
principal
headquarters
staff
and
the
Allied
military
personnel
escaped
,
despite
their
presence
in
Drvar
at
the
time
of
the
airborne
assault
.


The
operation
failed
due
to
a
number
of
factors
,
including
fierce
Partisan
resistance
in
the
town
itself
and
along
the
approaches
to
Drvar
.


The
failure
of
the
various
German
intelligence
agencies
to
share
the
limited
intelligence
available
on
Tito
's
exact
location
and
the
lack
of
contingency
planning
by
the
commander
of
the
German
airborne
force
also
contributed
to
the
unsuccessful
outcome
for
the
Germans
.


Hurricane
Bertha
caused
minor
damage
in
the
United
States
,
Bermuda
,
and
Atlantic
Canada
in
July
and
August

.


The
third
tropical
cyclone
,
second
named
storm
,
and
first
hurricane
of
the
1990
Atlantic
hurricane
season
,
Bertha

from
a
frontal
low
pressure
area
offshore
of
North
Carolina
on
July

.


Initially
subtropical
,
it
slowly
acquired
tropical
characteristics
while
tracked
southeast
and
then
southwestward
.


By
early
on
July
27
,
the
cyclone
was
re-classified
as
a
tropical
depression
.


following
its
transition
,
the
depression
intensified
and
was
upgraded
to
tropical
storm
bertha
on
july
28
.


The
storm
then
curved
northeastward
and
rapidly
strengthened
.


Bertha
became
a
hurricane
early
on
July
29
,
though
it
weakened
back
to
a
tropical
storm
later
that
day
.


On
the
following
day
,
Bertha
re-intensified
into
a
hurricane
and
peaked
as
an
80

while
weakening
and
transitioning
back
into
an
extratropical
cyclone
.


Large
waves
impacted
the
East
Coast
of
the
United

.


In
Canada
,
strong
winds
caused
moderate
crop
damage
on
Prince
Edward
Island
and
collapsed
a
suspension
bridge
in
Nova
Scotia
.


Rainfall
caused
minor
flooding
in

Le
Sars
is
a
commune
in
the
Pas-de-Calais
department
in
the
Nord-Pas-de-Calais
region
of
France
.


The
village
lies
along
the
Albert–Bapaume
road
.


The
village
is
situated
south
of
Arras
,
at
the
junction
of
the
D
11
and
the
D
929
roads
.


Courcelette

north-west
,
Eaucourt
l'Abbaye
to
the
south-east
,
the
Butte
de
Warlencourt
is
to
the
north-east
and
Destremont
Farm
is

.


Military
operations
began
in
the
area
in
September
1914
during
the
Race
to
the
Sea
,
when
the
divisions
of
the
II
Bavarian
Corps
advanced
westwards
on
the
north
bank
of
the
Somme
,
passing
through
Le
Sars
towards
Albert
and
Amiens
.


The
village
became
a
backwater
until
1916
,
when
the
British
and
French
began
the
Battle
of
the
Somme
and
was
the
site
of
several
air
operations
by
the
Royal
Flying
Corps
,
which
attacked
German
supply
dumps
in
the
vicinity
.


During
the
Battle
of
Flers–Courcelette
the
British
Fourth
Army
advanced
close
to
the
village
and
operations
to
capture
it
began
on
1
October
.


The
village
was
overrun
by
the
23rd
Division
on
7
October
,
during
the
Battle
of
Le
Transloy
several
hundred
prisoners
being
taken
from
the
4th
Division
.


After
the
village
was
captured
,
the
crest
of
the
rise
to
the
east
became
the
limit
of
the
British
advance
.


In
the
winter
of
1916–1917
,
which
was
the
worst
for
fifty
years
,
the
area
was
considered
by
the
troops
of
the
I
Anzac
Corps
to
be
the
foulest
sector
of
the
Somme
front
.


The
village
was
lost
in
March
1918
and
recaptured
for
the
last
time
in
August
by
the
21st
Division
.

Maghreb
refers
to
Islamist
militant
and
terrorist
activity
in
the
Maghreb
and
Sahel
regions
of
North
Africa
since
2002
.


The
conflict
succeeded
the
conclusion
of
the
Algerian
Civil
War
as
the
militant
group
Salafist
Group
for
Preaching
and
Combat
(
GSPC
)
allied
itself
with
al-Qaeda
to
eventually
become
al-Qaeda
in
the
Islamic
Maghreb
(
AQIM
)
.


algeria
and
other
maghreb
states
affected
by
the
activity
have
been
offered
assistance
in
fighting
extremist
militants
by
the
united

and
the

since
2007
,
when

began
.


The
Arab
Spring
in
2011
presented
an
opportunity
for
militant
Islamists
to
put
increasing
pressure
on
governments
and
engage
in
full-scale
warfare
.


In
2012
,
AQIM
and
Islamist
allies
captured
the
northern
half
of
Mali
,
until
being
fought
back
less
than
a
year
later
following
a
French-led
foreign
intervention
,
which
was
succeeded
by
the
Sahel-wide
Operation
Barkhane
.


In
Libya
the
Islamic
State
of
Iraq
and
the

(
ISIL
)
has
been
able
to
control
some
limited
territory
in
the

The
Battle
of
Quebec
(
)
was
fought
on
December
31
,
1775
,
between
American
Continental
Army
forces
and
the
British
defenders
of
Quebec
City
early
in
the
American
Revolutionary
War
.


The
battle
was
the
first
major
defeat
of
the
war
for
the
Americans
,
and
it
came
with
heavy
losses
.


General
Richard
Montgomery
was
killed
,
Benedict
Arnold
was
wounded
,
and
Daniel
Morgan
and
more
than
400
men
were
taken
prisoner
.


The
city
's
garrison
,
a
motley
assortment
of
regular
troops
and
militia
led
by
Quebec
's
provincial
governor
,
General
Guy
Carleton
,
suffered
a
small
number
of
casualties
.


Montgomery
's
army
had
captured
Montreal
on
November
13
,
and
early
in
December
they
became
one
force
that
was
led
by
Arnold
,
whose
men
had
made
an
arduous
trek
through
the
wilderness
of
northern
New
England
.


Governor
Carleton
had
escaped
from
Montreal
to
Quebec
,
the
Americans
'
next
objective
,
and
last-minute
reinforcements
arrived
to
bolster
the
city
's
limited
defenses
before
the
attacking
force
's
arrival
.


Concerned
that
expiring
enlistments
would
reduce
his
force
,
Montgomery
made
the
end-of-year
attack
in
a
blinding
snowstorm
to
conceal
his
army
's
movements
.


The
plan
was
for
separate
forces
led
by
Montgomery
and
Arnold
to
converge
in
the
lower
city
before
scaling
the
walls
protecting
the
upper
city
.


Montgomery
's
force
turned
back
after
he
was
killed
by
cannon
fire
early
in
the
battle
,
but
Arnold
's
force
penetrated
further
into
the
lower
city
.


Arnold
was
injured
early
in
the
attack
,
and
Morgan
led
the
assault
in
his
place
before
he
became
trapped
in
the
lower
city
and
was
forced
to
surrender
.


Arnold
and
the
Americans
maintained
an
ineffectual
blockade
of
the
city
until
spring
,
when
British
reinforcements
arrived
.


The
Million
Family
March
was
a
rally
in
Washington
D.C.
to
celebrate
family
unity
and
racial
and
religious
harmony
;
as
well
as
to
address
other
issues
,
including
abortion
,
capital
punishment
,
health
care
,
education
,
welfare
and
Social
Security
reform
,
substance
abuse
prevention
,
and
overhaul
of
the
World
Bank
and
International
Monetary
Fund
.


The
march
’
s
organizers
also
planned
a
voter
registration
drive
and
hoped
that
participants
would
be
encouraged
to
vote
in
the
upcoming
presidential
and
congressional
elections
.


Louis
Farrakhan
was
the
main
speaker
and
the
event
was
sponsored
by
his
organization
,
The
Nation
of
Islam
,
and
by
Sun
Myung
Moon
's
Family
Federation
for
World
Peace
and
Unification
(
usually
known
as
the
Unification
Church
)
.


It
was
held
on
October
16
,
2000
;
the
fifth
anniversary
of
the
Million
Man
March
,
which
was
also
organized
by
Minister
Farrakhan
.


Benjamin
Chavis
Muhammad
,
the
national
director
for
the
march
,
when
asked
by
``
USA
Today
''
if
he
thought
it
would
be
as
successful
as
the
Million
Man
March
answered
:
``
Yes
,
we
believe
that
the
Million
Family
March
will
be
as
successful
as
the
Million
Man
March
.


But
the
Million
Man
March
and
the
Million
Family
March
have
different
objectives
.


One
builds
on
the
other
.


The
Million
Family
March
is
an
expansion
of
the
Million
Man
March
.
''


Minister
Farrakhan
told
Nation
of
Islam
members
:
``
I
do
n't
want
us
to
get
bent
out
of
shape
because
folk
of
another
race
desire
to
help
.


I
say
to
the
Muslims
that
are
present
that
I
am
grateful
for
the
help
of
the
Family
Federation
for
World
Peace
under
Rev
.


and
Mrs
.


Moon
...


The
Honorable
Elijah
Muhammad
told
us
that
people
would
come
from
the
East
,
that
they
would
teach
us
everything
we
need
to
know
in
order
to
be
the
people
that
God
meant
for
us
to
be
.
''


Dan
Fefferman
,
a
leader
in
the
Unification
Church
of
the
United
States
,
wrote
a
letter
to
fellow
church
members
saying
that
Rev
.


Moon
knew
that
some
of
them
had
``
problems
with
Minister
Farrakhan
''
,
including
the
Nation
of
Islam
's
push
for
``
a
ban
on
interracial
marriage
and
their
support
for
a
separate
nation
for
American
blacks
...


There
are
certainly
policies
in
the
march
's
agenda
...
which
most
of
us
do
not
support
...
our
support
for
the
march
is
limited
to
central
themes
such
as
the
God-centered
family
,
interracial
harmony
,
interreligous
unity
and
moral
revival
.

In
his
speech
Minister
Farrakhan
called
for
racial
harmony

the
2009
united
nations
climate
change
conference
,
commonly
known
as
the
copenhagen
summit
,
was
held
at
the
bella
center
in
copenhagen
,
denmark
,
between
7
and
18
december
.


The
conference
included
the
15th
Conference
of
the
Parties
(
COP
15
)
to
the
United
Nations
Framework
Convention
on
Climate
Change
(
UNFCCC
)
and
the
5th
Meeting
of
the
Parties
(
MOP
5
)
to
the
Kyoto
Protocol
.


According
to
the
Bali
Road
Map
,
a
framework
for
climate
change
mitigation
beyond
2012
was
to
be
agreed
there
.


On
Friday
18
December
,
the
final
day
of
the
conference
,
international
media
reported
that
the
climate
talks
were
``
in
disarray
''
.


Media
also
reported
that
in
lieu
of
a
summit
collapse
,
only
a
``
weak
political
statement
''
was
anticipated
at
the
conclusion
of
the
conference
.


The
Copenhagen
Accord
was
drafted
by
the
United
States
,
China
,
India
,
Brazil
and
South
Africa
on
18
December
,
and
judged
a
``
meaningful
agreement
''
by
the
United
States
government
.


It
was
``
taken
note
of
''
,
but
not
``
adopted
''
,
in
a
debate
of
all
the
participating
countries
the
next
day
,
and
it
was
not
passed
unanimously
.


The
document
recognised
that
climate
change
is
one
of
the
greatest
challenges
of
the
present
day
and
that
actions
should
be
taken
to
keep
any
temperature
increases
to
below
2
°C
.


The
document
is
not
legally
binding
and
does
not
contain
any
legally
binding
commitments
for
reducing
emissions
.


The
siege
of
Inverness
Castle
took
place
in
1562
.


When
Mary
,
Queen
of
Scots
visited
Inverness
on
9
September
1562
the
gates
of
the
castle
were
shut
in
her
face
by
Alexander
Gordon
upon
the
orders
of
George
Gordon
,
4th
Earl
of
Huntly
,
who
was
chief
of
Clan
Gordon
and
Sheriff
of
the
county
.


The
castle
was
subsequently
besieged
by
supporters
of
the
Queen
.


The
siege
lasted
for
three
days
and
when
the
castle
fell
,
Alexander
Gordon
was
hanged
for
treason
.


His
head
was
displayed
on
the
castle
.


Some
key
members
of
the
garrison
,
which
consisted
of
only
12
or
14
``
able
persons
''
were
imprisoned
,
the
others
allowed
to
go
free
.


The
Queen
slept
at
Inverness
Castle
on
the
nights
of
11
,
12
,
13
and
14
September
1562
,
then
moved
on
to
Spynie
Palace
.


Alexander
Mackenzie
's
later
account
of
the
siege
includes
the
clans
Mackenzie
,
Ross
,
Fraser
and
Munro
contributing
to
Queen
Mary
's
rescue
but
only
the
Frasers
and
Munros
are
mentioned
in
the
earliest
account
written
by
George
Buchanan
.


buchanan
's
account
was
originally
written
in
latin
but
was
published
in
english
by
james
aikman
in
1827
,
it
reads
:
upon
hearing
of
the
danger
of
their
princess
,
a
great
number
of
the
ancient
scots
,
partly
by
persuasion
,
and
partly
of
their
own
accord
,
flocked
around
her
,
particularly
the
frasers
and
unk
,
the
bravest
of
these
tribes
.


When
the
queen
found
herself
sufficiently
strong
,
she
laid
siege
to
the
castle
,
which
having
neither
a
sufficient
garrison
,
not
being
properly
fortified
for
sustaining
an
attack
,
surrendered
,
when
the
commanders
were
executed
,
and
the
men
dismissed
.


The
English
diplomat
Thomas
Randolph
recorded
a
remark
made
by
Queen
Mary
at
Inverness
,
who
was
in
high
spirits
and
undismayed
in
the
conflict
.


When
the
night
watch
returned
in
the
morning
she
regretted
that
she
was
``
not
a
man
to
know
what
life
it
was
to
lie
all
night
in
the
fields
,
or
to
walk
upon
the
causeway
with
a
jack
and
knapschall
,
a
Glasgow
buckler
and
a
broad
sword
.

The
Walt
Disney
World
Millennium
Celebration
was
an
event
at
the
Walt
Disney
World
Resort
as
part
of
millennium
celebrations
held
around
the
world
.


Running
from
October
1
,
1999
to
January
1
,
2001
,
the
celebration
was
primarily
based
at
Epcot
,
with
its
emphasis
on
human
potential
and
the
possibilities
of
the
future
.


The
Celebration
spawned
many
changes
for
Epcot
.


In
1999
a
large
wand
was
erected
next
to
Spaceship
Earth
with
``
2000
''
written
on
it
,
also
a
new
fireworks
show
was
created
for
the
World
Showcase
Lagoon
called
``
''
.


A
parade
located
in
Epcot
called
``
Tapestry
of
Nations
''
was
also
created
for
the
celebration
,
that
would
also
become
the
inspiration
for
the
Disney
produced
Super
Bowl
XXXIV
halftime
show
which
promoted
the
Millennium
Celebration
.


``
Celebrate
the
Future
Hand
in
Hand
''
was
the
theme
song
of
the
celebration
,
and
was
released
on
the
1999
Walt
Disney
World
Official
Album
.


The
Walt
Disney
World
Millennium
Celebration
album
also
contained
this
song
as
well
as
the
soundtracks
of
the
fireworks
show
and
the
parade
.


This
CD
was
also
available
in
a
slightly
different
form
on
the
Walt
Disney
World
:
Yearlong
Millennium
Celebration
CD
,
a
promotional
album
available
to
purchasers
of
Energizer
batteries

a
number
of
hilly
sections
near
Osaka
Castle
.

the
battle
of
bull
's
ferry
on
20
and
21
july
1780
saw
two
american
brigades
under
brigadier
general
anthony
wayne
attack
a
party
of
loyalist
americans
led
by
thomas
ward
.


The
Loyalists
successfully
defended
a
blockhouse
against
an
ineffective
bombardment
by
four
American
artillery
pieces
and
a
failed
attempt
to
storm
the
position
by
Wayne
's
infantry
.


During
the
action
,
American
light
dragoons
under
Major
Light
Horse
Harry
Lee
drove
off
a
large
number
of
cattle
that
were
kept
in
the
area
for
the
use
of
the
British
army
in
New
York
City
.


The
clash
inspired
British
Major
John
André
to
write
a
satirical
ballad
entitled
``
The
Cow
Chace
''
.


the
skirmish
was
fought
at
bulls
ferry
,
new
jersey
in
the
northern
theater
of
the
american
revolutionary
war
after
saratoga
.


At
this
stage
of
the
conflict
only
raids
and
minor
actions
occurred
in
the
north

The
Battle
of
Laswari
took
place
on
November
1
,
1803
near
Laswari
village
,
Alwar
.


It
was
part
of
the
Second
Anglo-Maratha
War
.


The
British
under
Gerard
Lake
were
anxious
to
finish
the
war
by
neutralizing
the
last
substantial
force
that
the
Maratha
confederacy
possessed
,
consisting
of
twelve
battalions
of
regular
infantry
trained
by
the
adventurer
Chevalier
Dudrenec
.


Dudrenec
deserted
and
command
fell
onto
Ambaji
Ingle
,
a
Maratha
officer
.


Lake
decided
to
dispense
first
with
his
artillery
and
later
with
his
infantry
in
a
series
of
forced
marches
to
catch
up
with
these
,
he
thus
initially
encountered
the
enemy
force
with
just
three
brigades
of
cavalry
,
the
British
troopers
by
repeated
charges
were
able
to
contain
the
Maratha
army
until
their
infantry
arrived
.


The
British
,
commanded
by
Lake
were
about
10,000
men
strong
,
opposing
Sindhia
's
force
of
9,000
veteran
infantry
and
5,000
cavalry
under
the
command
of
Abaji
.


The
British
were
also
supported
by
allied
troops
from
Alwar
.


The
Maratha
infantry
made
a
most
gallant
defence
,
standing
their
ground
until
the
survivors
laid
down
their
arms
.


The
cavalry
also
suffered
heavily
.


Seventy-two
guns
and
a
large
quantity
of
ammunition
and
stores
were
captured
.


Lake
later
wrote
``
I
never
was
in
so
severe
a
business
in
my
life
or
anything
like
it…
these
fellows
fought
like
devils
,
or
rather
like
heroes
''
.


``
The
casualties
on
both
sides
were
very
heavy
.


The
Company
lost
many
officers
,
including
Maj.
Gen.
Weir
,
Col.
Vandeleur
,
and
Maj.
Griffith
.


Lakes
's
son
was
also
killed

The
Qinghe
Special
Steel
Corporation
disaster
was
an
industrial
disaster
that
occurred
on
April
18
,
2007
,
in
Qinghe
District
,
Tieling
,
Liaoning
,
China
.


Thirty-two
people
were
killed
and
six
were
injured
when
a
ladle
used
to
transport
molten
steel
separated
from
an
overhead
rail
in
the
Qinghe
Special
Steel
Corporation
factory
.


A
subsequent
investigation
by
the
Chinese
authorities
found
that
the
plant
had
been
lacking
many
major
safety
features
and
was
severely
below
regulation
benchmarks
,
with
the
direct
cause
of
the
accident
being
attributed
to
inappropriate
use
of
substandard
equipment
.


The
investigation
also
concluded
that
the
various
other
safety
failings
at
the
facility
were
contributing
factors
.


The
report
went
on
to
criticize
safety
standards
all
throughout
the
Chinese
steel
industry
.


Sun
Huashan
,
deputy
head
of
the
State
Administration
of
Work
Safety
,
said
that
it
was
``
the
most
serious
accident
to
hit
China
's
steel
industry
since
1949
.

Two
people
on

An
investigation
found
that
a
non-return
valve
in
the
fuel
system
had
been
installed
the
wrong
way
round
causing
two
of
the
engines
to
be
starved
of
fuel
.


the
technician
found
responsible
for
incorrectly
fitting
the
valve
was
charged
under
the
air
force
act
.


Following
the
accident
,
the
non-return
valve
was
re-designed
so
it
could
not
be
installed
incorrectly
.


Two
RAF
officers
who
took
part
in
the
rescue
after
the
crash
were
highly
praised
for
``
refusing
to
give
up
while
there
was
hope
of
finding
survivors
among
the
wreckage

The
2012
Homs
offensive
was
a
Syrian
Army
offensive
on
the
armed
rebellion
stronghold
of
Homs
,
within
the
scope
of
the
Siege
of
Homs
,
beginning
in
early
February
2012
and
ending
with
the
U.N.
brokered
cease
fire
on
April
14
,
2012
.


The
offensive
began
by
artillery
bombardment
by
the
Syrian
armed
forces
in
response
to
an
attack
by
the
Free
Syrian
Army
on
Syrian
Army
checkpoints
on
3
February
2012
,
killing
10
soldiers
.


Government
forces
then
began
to
bombard
the
city
using
tanks
,
helicopters
,
and
artillery
,
rockets
and
mortars
.


The
Syrian
government
has
denied
that
the
bombardment
is
indiscriminate
and
blamed
``
armed
groups
''
for
the
civilian
deaths
,
including
the
deaths
of
foreign
journalists
.


Heavy
shelling
continued
on
29
February
,
as
the
Syrian
armed
forces
launched
a
ground
operation
to
restore
control
of
the
Baba
Amr
neighbourhood
.


The
Syrian
government
announced
that
the
army
was
being
sent
into
the
area
and
were
``
cleaning
''
it
from
rebel
fighters
,
and
that
the
operation
would
be
over
in
a
matter
of
hours
.


At
this
stage
,
water
supplies
,
electricity
and
communications
were
entirely
cut
off
in
the
Baba
Amr
district
according
to
opposition
activists
.


Heavy
clashes
continued
throughout
the
day
,
as
the
Syrian
Army
's
4th
Armoured
Division
sent
in
tanks
and
infantry
.


Baba
Amr
was
finally
secured
by
the
Syrian
army
on
the
morning
of
1
March
,
as
rebel
forces
claimed
they
had
made
a
``
tactical
retreat
''
from
the
area
,
after
running
low
on
weapons
and
ammunition

between
leading
associate
members
of
the
International
Cricket
Council
(
ICC
)
.


The
tournament
took
place
during
2015
to
2017
.


It
ran
in
parallel
with
the
2015–17
ICC
World
Cricket
League
Championship
but
with
slightly
different
teams
.


As
Ireland
and
Afghanistan
had
qualified
for
the
ICC
One
Day
International
Championship
ranking
qualification
process
,
they
were
replaced
by
Kenya
and
Nepal
in
the
limited
over
event
;
however
they
continued
to
play
the
four-day
event
.


as
a
result
of
changes
to
the
structure
of
international
cricket
announced
by
the
icc
in
january
2014
,
the
winner
of
the
unk
intercontinental
cup
(
and
following
editions
of
the
tournament
)
were
originally
scheduled
to
play
four
five-day
matches
against
the
bottom
ranked
test
nation
(
two
home
and
two
away
matches
)
,
an
event
known
as
the
2018
icc
test
challenge
.


should
the
winner
of
the
intercontinental
cup
go
on
to
win
the
icc
test
challenge
,
they
would
have
became
the
11th
test
nation
.


however
,
in
february
2017
following
an
icc
board
meeting
,
changes
were
agreed
in
principle
to
expand
the
number
of
test
nations
to
twelve
.


both
afghanistan
and
ireland
were
likely
to
be
granted
test
status
before
the
proposed
2018
icc
test
challenge
.


in
june
2017
,
the
icc
awarded
both
afghanistan
and
ireland
full
member
status
,
making
them
eligible
to
play
test
match
cricket
.


as
a
result
,
the
planned
test
challenge
was
scrapped
.


Afghanistan
won
the
competition
,
after
beating
the
United
Arab
Emirates
by
10
wickets
in
their
final
game
.


They
finished
with
121
points
,
with

rashid
khan
,
man
of
the
match
for
afghanistan
in

final
fixture
,
said
that
winning
the
intercontinental
cup
was
``
good
preparation
for
test
cricket
for
us
''

hurricane
floyd
was
a
very
powerful
cape
verde
hurricane
which
struck
the
bahamas
and
the
east
coast
of
the
united
states
.


It
was
the
sixth
named
storm
,
fourth
hurricane
,
and
third
major
hurricane
in
the
1999
Atlantic
hurricane
season
.


Floyd
triggered
the
fourth
largest
evacuation
in
US
history
(
behind
Hurricane
Irma
,
Hurricane
Gustav
,
and
Hurricane
Rita
)
when
2.6
million
coastal
residents
of
five
states
were
ordered
from
their
homes
as
it
approached
.


The
hurricane
formed
off
the
coast
of
Africa
and
lasted
from
September
7
to
19
,
becoming
extratropical
after
September
17
,
and
peaked
in
strength
as
a
very
strong
Category
4
hurricane—just
2
mph
short
of
the
highest
possible
rating
on
the
Saffir–Simpson
Hurricane
Scale
.


It
was
among
the
largest
Atlantic
hurricanes
of
its
strength
ever
recorded
,
in
terms
of
gale-force
diameter
.


Floyd
was
once
forecast
to
strike
Florida
,
but
turned
away
.


Instead
,
Floyd
struck
the
Bahamas
at
peak
strength
,
causing
heavy
damage
.


It
then
moved
parallel
to
the
East
Coast
of
the
United
States
,
causing
massive
evacuations
and
costly
preparations
from
Florida
through
the
Mid-Atlantic
states
.


the
storm
weakened
significantly
,
however
,
before
striking
the
cape
fear
region
,
north
carolina
as
a
very
strong
category
2
hurricane
,
and
caused
further
damage
as
it
traveled
up
the
mid-atlantic
region
and
into
new
england
.


The
hurricane
produced
torrential
rainfall
in
Eastern
North
Carolina
,
adding
more
rain
to
an
area
already
hit
by
Hurricane
Dennis
just
weeks
earlier
.


The
rains
caused
widespread
flooding
over
a
period
of
several
weeks
;
nearly
every
river
basin
in
the
eastern
part
of
the
state
exceeded
500-year
flood
levels
.


In
total
,
Floyd
was
responsible
for
76
fatalities
and
$
6.5
billion
(
1999
USD
)
in
damage
.


Due
to
the
destruction
,
the
World
Meteorological
Organization
retired
the
name
``
Floyd
''
.

Tokyo
,
Japan
and
was
held
on
Sunday
,
24
February
.


An
IAAF
Gold
Label
Road
Race
,
it
was
the
first
World

Majors
event
to
be
held
that
year
and
represented
the
first
occasion
that
the
Tokyo
race
was
part
of
the
elite-level
marathon
series
.


The
2013
Tokyo
Marathon
featured
marathon
races
for
runners
and
wheelchair
racers
.


A
10-kilometre
race
was
also
held
for
the
disabled
and
runners
under

years
.


Dennis
Kimetto
won
the
men
's
race
in
a
course
record
time
of
2:06:50
hours
.


The
women

,
Aberu
Kebede
,
had

of
2:25:34
hours
,
which
was
six

set
a
new
participation
record
with
a
total
of

Stage
5
(
or
,
originally
,
``
Stage
V
''
)
is
an
unofficial
stage
at
the
Walnut
Valley
Festival
,
an
annual
bluegrass
festival
in
Winfield
,
Kansas
,
United
States
.


Set
up
in
the
Pecan
Grove
campground
,
the
informal
stage
began
in
1987
when
camper
Russell
Brace
and
friends
built
it
on
the
back
of
a
flatbed
truck
.


The
stage
is
so-named
because
the
festival
proper
has
four
main
stages
.


The
stage
was
immediately
popular
and
is
now
a
cherished
tradition
at
the
annual
event
.


Audiences
at
Stage
5
can
usually
expect
to
hear
typical
acoustic
string
instruments
.


However
,
many
musicians
,
while
there
,
part
from
traditional
bluegrass
styles
and
emphasize
a
looser
,
more
rock-oriented
interpretation
of
roots
music
.


Several
notables
have
played
Stage
5
.


Among
them
:
Tommy
Emmanuel
,
The
Wilders
,
Beppe
Gambetta
,
an
early
incarnation
of
the
Dixie
Chicks
,
and
Split
Lip

The
Battle
of
Radom
,
also
known
as
the
Battle
of

Poland
during
the
Second
World
War
.


It
lasted
from

September
1939
to

Polish
troops
of
the
Prusy
Army
,
under
General
,
defended
the
city
of
Iłża
and
the
road
from
Sandomierz
to
Radom
.


The
Poles
were
not
ready
to
meet
head
on
overwhelming
German
XV
Army
Corps
(
General
Hermann
Hoth
)
,
and
were
easily
defeated
after
two
days
of
fighting
.


Prusy
Army
,
in
the
aftermath
of
the
battle
,
ceased
to
exist
.


Some
of
the

's
units
joined
other
tactical
groupings
of
the
Polish
armed
forces
.


In
the

,
Elton
John
set
out
on

started
off
in
North

and
ended
in
Europe
.


The
second
year
of
the
tour
also
started
off
in
North
America
but
was
interrupted
by
John
's
and
Billy
Joel
's
1998

The
Battle
of
the
Chesapeake
,
also
known
as
the
Battle
of
the
Virginia
Capes
or
simply
the
Battle
of
the
Capes
,
was
a
crucial
naval
battle
in
the
American
Revolutionary
War
that
took
place
near
the
mouth
of
the
Chesapeake
Bay
on
5
September
1781
.


The
combatants
were
a
British
fleet
led
by
Rear
Admiral
Sir
Thomas
Graves
and
a
French
fleet
led
by
Rear
Admiral
Francois
Joseph
Paul
,
the
Comte
de
Grasse
.


The
battle
was
strategically
decisive
,
in
that
it
prevented
the
Royal
Navy
from
reinforcing
or
evacuating
the
besieged
forces
of
Lieutenant
General
Lord
Cornwallis
at
Yorktown
,
Virginia
.


The
French
were
able
to
achieve
control
of
the
sea
lanes
against
the
British
and
provided
the
Franco-American
army
with
siege
artillery
and
French
reinforcements
.


These
proved
decisive
in
the
Siege
of
Yorktown
,
effectively
securing
independence
for
the
Thirteen
Colonies
.


Admiral
de
Grasse
had
the
option
to
attack
British
forces
in
either
New
York
or
Virginia
;
he
opted
for
Virginia
,
arriving
at
the
Chesapeake
at
the
end
of
August
.


Admiral
Graves
learned
that
de
Grasse
had
sailed
from
the
West
Indies
for
North
America
and
that
French
Admiral
de
Barras
had
also
sailed
from
Newport
,
Rhode
Island
.


He
concluded
that
they
were
going
to
join
forces
at
the
Chesapeake
.


He
sailed
south
from
Sandy
Hook
,
New
Jersey
,
outside
New
York
Harbor
,
with
19
ships
of
the
line
and
arrived
at
the
mouth
of
the
Chesapeake
early
on
5
September
to
see
de
Grasse
's
fleet
already
at
anchor
in
the
bay
.


De
Grasse
hastily
prepared
most
of
his
fleet
for
battle—24
ships
of
the
line—and
sailed
out
to
meet
him
.


The
two-hour
engagement
took
place
after
hours
of
maneuvering
.


The
lines
of
the
two
fleets
did
not
completely
meet
;
only
the
forward
and
center
sections
fully
engaged
.


The
battle
was
consequently
fairly
evenly
matched
,
although
the
British
suffered
more
casualties
and
ship
damage
,
and
it
broke
off
when
the
sun
set
.


The
British
tactics
have
been
a
subject
of
debate
ever
since
.


The
two
fleets
sailed
within
view
of
each
other
for
several
days
,
but
de
Grasse
preferred
to
lure
the
British
away
from
the
bay
where
de
Barras
was
expected
to
arrive
carrying
vital
siege
equipment
.


He
broke
away
from
the
British
on
13
September
and
returned
to
the
Chesapeake
,
where
de
Barras
had
since
arrived
.


Graves
returned
to
New
York
to
organize
a
larger
relief
effort
;
this
did
not
sail
until
19
October
,
two
days
after
Cornwallis
surrendered
.

Arena
in
Munich
,
Germany
.


The
match
was
to
decide
the
winner
of
the
2011–12
season
of
the
UEFA
Champions
League
,
Europe
's
premier
club
football
tournament
.

League
final
to
be
held
at
the
Allianz
Arena
(
known
as
Fußball
Arena
München
for
the
final
)
.


As
tenants
of
the
Arena
,
this
meant
Bayern
were
the
first
finalists
to
have
home
advantage
since
1984
.


Both
teams
progressed
to
the
knockout
stages
by
finishing
top
of
their
group
.


Bayern
then
beat
Basel
,
Marseille
and
Real
Madrid
to
reach
the
final
,
while
Chelsea
knocked
out
Napoli
,
Benfica
and
defending
champions
Barcelona
.


Bayern
took
the
lead
late
in
the
second
half
through
Thomas
Müller
,
but
Didier
Drogba
equalised
for
Chelsea
five
minutes
later
to
take
the
game
to
extra
time
,
in
which
Arjen
Robben
missed
an
awarded
penalty
,
Petr
Čech
saving
the
low
drive
.


The
teams
stayed
level
at
1–1
and
the
match
went
to
a
penalty
shoot-out
,
which
Chelsea
won
4–3
to
clinch
their
first
Champions
League
title
.


In
doing
so
,
they
became
the
first
London
club
to
win
the
tournament
,
the
fifth
English
club
and
22nd
overall
.


As
winners
,
Chelsea
took
part
in
the
2012
UEFA
Super
Cup
,
losing
4–1
to
Atlético
Madrid
,
the
winners
of
the
2011–12
UEFA
Europa
League
.


The
victory
also
allowed
them
to
enter
the
following
season
's
Champions
League
competition
(
having
failed
to
qualify
for
it
by
their
league
finishing
position
)
at
the
expense
of
London
rivals
Tottenham
Hotspur
,
who
would
otherwise
have
entered
the
competition
having
finished
fourth
in
the
Premier
League
.


Chelsea
also
represented
UEFA
at
the
2012
FIFA
Club

entering
at
the

stage
;
however
,
they
were
beaten
1–0
by
Corinthians
in
the
final
.

The
Wola
massacre
(
)
was
the
systematic
killing
of
between
40,000
and
50,000
people
in
the
Wola
suburb
of
Poland
's
capital
city
Warsaw
by
German
Wehrmacht
and
German
collaborators
in
the
Russian
RONA
forces
during
the
early
phase
of
the
Warsaw
Uprising
.


The
genocide
was
ordered
by
Hitler
who
directed
to
kill
``
anything
that
moves
''
.


From
5
to
12
August
1944
,
tens
of
thousands
of
Polish
civilians
along
with
captured
Home
Army
resistance
fighters
were
brutally
and
systematically
murdered
by
the
Germans
in
organised
mass
executions
throughout
Wola
.


Whole
families
perished
including
babies
,
children
and
old
people
.


Germans
murdered
patients
in
hospitals
,
killing
them
in
their
beds
.


Doctors
and
nurses
caring
for
them
were
also
killed
.


Dead
bodies
were
piled
up
to
be
burnt
and
before
burning
dogs
were
let
loose
to
check
if
anybody
was
still
alive
.


If
found
alive
they
were
killed
on
the
spot
.


Black
fires
from
the
burning
of
thousands
of
bodies
covered
the
whole
suburb
.


Hundreds
of
women
were
raped
and
then
killed
.


Parents
were
made
to
watch
their
children
being
killed
and
priests
trying
to
protect
those
who
sought
refuge
in
churches
were
murdered
,
some
at
the
altar
.


The
Germans
anticipated
that
these
atrocities
would
crush
the
insurrectionists
'
will
to
fight
and
put
the
uprising
to
a
swift
end
.


However
,
the
ruthless
pacification
of
Wola
only
stiffened
Polish
resistance
,
and
it
took
another
two
months
of
heavy
fighting
for
the
Germans
to
regain
control
of
the
city
.


The
liberation
of
Isfahan
was
a
direct
result
of
the
Battle
of
Murche-Khort
in
which
the
Persian
army
under

attacked
and
routed
Ashraf
's
Afghan
army
.


The
day
after
Murche-Khort
on
November
16
,
1729
Nader
marched
his
army
into
Isfahan
where
the
looting
and
mob
violence
that

gripped
the
city
in
the
chaotic
aftermath
of
Ashraf
's
departure
ceased
immediately
.


Order
was
restored
with
many
of
the
Afghans
hiding
throughout
the
city
being
dragged
through
the
streets
and
massacred
without
mercy
in
reprisals
.


The
tomb
of
Mahmud
Hotaki
was
also
another

II
regains
the
Safavid
capital
.


On
December
9
,
1729
Nader
awaited
outside
the
city
gates
for
the
Shah
's
arrival
.


Tahmasp
was
received
in
a
ceremony
in
which
as
soon
as
he
reached
Nader
's
person
he
``
dismounted
from
his
horse
in
a
show
of
respect
whence
Nader
did
likewise
rushing
forth
to
dissuade
the
Shah
from
his
magnanimous
deed
,
however
the
Shah
insisted
they
walk
together
and
expressed
an
inability
to
reward
Nader
's
ceaseless
service
to
him
.


After
a
few
more
minutes
of
polite
conversation
the
Shah
remounted
his
steed
and
led
the
way
back
into
the
city
with
Nader
following
close
behind
''
.


The
Shah
's
return
was
greeted
with
much
jubilation
from
the
citizens
of
Isfahan
.


Tahmasp
however
was
reduced
to
tears
when
he
witnessed
the
destitution
and
abject
condition
of
the
once
glorious
capital
of
a
mighty
empire

After
the
bombings
,
Jewell
was
temporarily
investigated
as
a
suspect
by
the
Federal
Bureau
of
Investigation
and
the
news
media
falsely
focused
on
him
aggressively
as
the
presumed
culprit
.


However
,
in
October
1996
,
Jewell
was
exonerated
when
the
FBI
declared
that
he
was
no
longer
a
person
of
interest
.

tried
before
being
convicted

The
'
(
ecclesiastical
reservation
)
was
a
measure
inserted
into
the
Peace
of
Augsburg
of
1555
to
balance
the
principal
proviso
of
'
in
ecclesiastical
lands
.


In
the
hereditary
dynastic
lands
,
such
as
those
governed
by
a
prince
or
a
duke
,
the
principle
of
``
''
(
Latin
:
whose
land
,
his
religion
)
provided
that
the
religion
of
the
people
would
be
the
same
as
that
of
the
territorial
ruler
.


If
this
same
principle
were
applied
in
ecclesiastical
lands
,
such
as
those
ruled
by
a
prince-bishop
or
an
abbot
,
the
conversion
of
an
incumbent
to
Lutheranism
would
convert
the
entire
principality
to
Protestantism
.


The
'
was
inserted
to
prevent
this
:
in
the
event
that
the
prince
converted
to
Lutheranism
,
the
ruler
would
forfeit
his
seat
and
be
replaced
by
a
Catholic
.


The
measure
was
only
inserted
into
the
treaty
as
a
result
of
Imperial
authority
,
as
it
was
not
supported
by
Protestants
participating
in
the
treaty
.


Nonetheless
,
the
Protestants
chose
not
to
veto
the
measure
and
in
return
gained
the
'
that
protected
Protestant
knights
and
long-established
Protestant
cities
and
communities
,
including
those
in
territories
where
``
''
applied
.


The
measure
was
contested
in
1583
,
when
the
Archbishop-Elector
of
Cologne
,
Gebhard
Truchsess
von
Waldburg
,
converted
to
Protestantism
,
specifically
to
Calvinism
.


In
the
Cologne
War
,
supported
by
the
Dutch
Republic
and
the
Electorate
of
the
Palatinate
,
he
was
eventually
defeated
by
his
Catholic
replacement
,
Ernest
of
Bavaria
,
who
was
supported
by
William
V
,
Duke
of
Bavaria
his
brother
and
Philip
II
of
Spain
,
whose
army
,
under
the
command
of
Alexander
Farnese
,
Duke
of
Parma
,
physically
recovered
the
electoral
territory
.


Ernest
's
victory
upheld
the
principle
of
the
``
.
''


The
measure
continued
to
be
a
grievance
of
Protestants
.


After
the
ascension
of
Matthias
as
Holy
Roman
Emperor
,
his
new
chancellor
,
Melchior
Klesl
,
hoped
to
dissolve
the
religious
alliances
of
the
time
—
the
Protestant
Union
and
the
Catholic
League
—
and
bring
people
of
all
faiths
back
under
the
authority
of
the
Emperor
.


In
response
,
the
Protestant
Union
's
Assembly
at
Rothenburg
ob
der
Tauber
voted
in
March
1613
to
not
disband
while
the
Catholic
League
was
still
in
existence
,
and
to
ensure
certain
long-standing
grievances
were
rectified
,
including
the
``
''
.


The
Reavey
and
O'Dowd
killings
were
two
co-ordinated
gun
attacks
on
4
January
1976
in
County
Armagh
,
Northern
Ireland
.


six
irish
catholic
civilians
died
after
members
of
the
ulster
volunteer
force
(
uvf
)
,
an
ulster
loyalist
paramilitary
group
,
broke
into
their
homes
and
shot
them
.


Three
members
of
the
Reavey
family
were
shot
at
their
home
in
Whitecross
and
four
members
of
the
O'Dowd
family
were
shot
at
their
home
in
Ballydougan
.


Two
of
the
Reaveys
and
three
of
the
O'Dowds
were
killed
outright
,
with
the
third
Reavey
victim
dying
of
brain
hemorrhage
almost
a
month
later
.


The
shootings
were
part
of
a
string
of
attacks
on
Catholics
and
Irish
nationalists
by
the
``
Glenanne
gang
''
;
an
alliance
of
loyalist
militants
,
British
soldiers
and
Royal
Ulster
Constabulary
(
RUC
)
police
officers
.


Billy
McCaughey
,
a
police
officer
from
the
RUC
Special
Patrol
Group
,
admitted
taking
part
and
accused
another
officer
of
being
involved
.


His
colleague
John
Weir
said
that
those
involved
included
a
British
soldier
,
two
police
officers
and
an
alleged
police
agent
:
Robin
'the
Jackal
'
Jackson
.


The
next
day
,
gunmen
shot
dead
ten
Ulster
Protestant
civilians
in
the
Kingsmill
massacre
.


This
was
claimed
as
retaliation
for
the
Reavey
and
O'Dowd
shootings
.


Kingsmill
was
the
climax
of
a
string
of
tit-for-tat
killings
in
the
area
during
the
mid-1970s
.

''
there
is
now
a
winter
event
,
known
as
the
January
Jamboree
also
held
in
Fort
Lauderdale
,
FL
.


The
Women
's
Strike
for
Equality
was
a
strike
which
took
place
in
the
United
States
on
August
26
,
1970
.


It
celebrated
the
50th
anniversary
of
the
passing
of
the
Nineteenth
Amendment
,
which
effectively
gave
American
women
the
right
to
vote
.


The
rally
was
sponsored
by
the
National
Organization
for
Women
(
NOW
)
.


About
50,000
women
gathered
for
the
protest
in
New
York
City
and
even
more
throughout
the
country
.


At
this
time
,
the
gathering
was
the
largest
on
behalf
of
women
in
the
United
States
.


The
strike
,
spearheaded
by
Betty
Friedan
,
self-stated
three
primary
goals
:
free
abortion
on
demand
,
equal
opportunity
in
the
workforce
,
and
free
childcare
.


The
strike
also
advocated
for
other
second
wave
feminist
goals
more
generally
,
such
as
political
rights
for
women
,
and
social
equality
in
relationships
such
as
marriage
.


The
Wech
Baghtu
wedding
party
airstrike
refers
to
the
killing
of
about
37
Afghan
civilians
,
mostly
women
and
children
,
and
injuring
about
2
others
by
a
United
States
military
airstrike
on
3
November
2008
.


The
group
was
celebrating
a
wedding
at
a
housing
complex
in
the
village
of
Wech
Baghtu
,
a
Taliban
stronghold
in
the
Shah
Wali
Kot
District
of
Kandahar
province
,
Afghanistan
.


The
Afghan
government
accused
the
Taliban
of
seeking
shelter
near
the
wedding
party
.


On
7
November
2008
,
Afghan
officials
said
a
joint
investigation
found
that
37
civilians
and
26
insurgents
were
killed
in
Wech
Baghtu
.


Wedding
parties
in
Afghanistan
are
segregated
by
sex
;
of
the
civilians
,
23
were
children
,
10
were
women
,
and
4
were
men
.


Another
27
persons
were
injured
,
including
the
bride
.


The
bombing
destroyed
the
housing
complex
where
women
and
children
had
gathered
to
celebrate
.


On
5
November
2008
,
Afghan
President
Hamid
Karzai
responded
by
demanding
that
newly
elected
US
President
Barack
Obama
end
civilian
deaths
,
stating
``
Our
demand
is
that
there
will
be
no
civilian
casualties
in
Afghanistan
.


We
can
not
win
the
fight
against
terrorism
with
airstrikes
—
this
is
my
first
demand
of
the
new
president
of
the
United

—
to
put
an
end
to
civilian

The
Battle
of
Harlaw
(
)
was
a
Scottish
clan
battle
fought
on
24
July
1411
just
north
of
Inverurie
in
Aberdeenshire
.


It
was
one
of
a
series
of
battles
fought
during
the
Middle
Ages
between
the
barons
of
northeast
Scotland
against
those
from
the
west
coast
.


The
battle
was
fought
to
resolve
competing
claims
to
the
Earldom
of
Ross
,
a
large
region
of
northern
Scotland
.


Robert
Stewart
,
Duke
of
Albany
,
Regent
of
Scotland
,
had
taken
control
of
the
earldom
as
guardian
of
his
niece
Euphemia
Leslie
.


This
claim
was
contested
by
Donald
,
Lord
of
the
Isles
,
who
had
married
Euphemia
's
aunt
Mariota
.


Donald
invaded
Ross
with
the
intention
of
seizing
the
earldom
by
force
.


First
he
defeated
a
large
force
of
Mackays
at
the
Battle
of
Dingwall
.


He
captured
Dingwall
Castle
and
then
advanced
on
Aberdeen
with
10,000
clansmen
.


Near
Inverurie
he
was
met
by
1,000–2,000
of
the
local
gentry
,
many
in
armour
,
hastily
assembled
by
the
Earl
of
Mar
.


After
a
day
of
fierce
fighting
there
was
no
clear
victor
;
Donald
had
lost
900
men
before
retreating
back
to
the
Western
Isles
,
and
Mar
had
lost
600
.


The
latter
could
claim
a
strategic
victory
in
that
Aberdeen
was
saved
,
and
within
a
year
Albany
had
recaptured
Ross
and
forced
Donald
to
surrender
.


However
Mariota
was
later
awarded
the
earldom
of
Ross
in
1424
and
the
Lordship
of
the
Isles
would
keep
the
title
for
much
of
the
15th
century
.


The
ferocity
of
the
battle
gave
it
the
nickname
``
Red
Harlaw
''
.


It
is
commemorated
by
a
40-foot
(
12
m
)
high
memorial
on
the
battlefield
near
the
town
of
Inverurie
,
supposedly
by
the
church
at
Chapel
of
Garioch
,
and
by
ballads
and
music
.


The
Battle
of
Reval
took
place
on
June
30
,
1602
,
during
the
Polish–Swedish
War
(
1600–1611
)
near
present-day
Tallinn
in
Estonia
.


The
Polish
forces
were
led
by
Grand
Field
Hetman
Stanisław
Żółkiewski
who
had
been
sent
against
Swedish
forces
gathering
by
Tallinn
by
Grand
Crown
Hetman
Jan
Zamoyski
.


Żółkiewski
attacked
``
on
the
march
''
with
two
squadrons
of
Polish
hussars
.


The
charge
however
was
not
successful
.


As
a
result
,
the
Swedish
forces
put
up
frisian
horses
as
a
protection
against
further
frontal
cavalry
charges
.


Żółkiewski
then
sent
light
cavalry
on
a
round
about
flanking
maneuver
which
attacked
the
Swedes
from
behind
,
coinciding
with
another
charge
by
the
hussars
.


The
Swedish
lines
broke
as
a
result
.


The
Swedes
were
led
by
Reinhold
Arnep
.


The
2006
Kolkata
leather
factory
fire
was
a
deadly
industrial
fire
that
occurred
in
West
Bengal
,
India
,
on
22
November
2006
.


The
fire
broke
out
in
a
leather
bag
factory
located
in
the
Tannix
International
,
Topsia
,
in
the
South
24
Parganas
district
in
Greater
Kolkata
area
,
and
generated
a
wave
of
criticism
of
the
poor
safety
standards
in
place
among
the
country
's
sweatshops
.


The
industrial
fire
claimed
the
lives
of
at
least
ten
people
,
who
were
unable
to
escape
because
the
doors
were
locked
shut
illegally
.


Authorities
,
in
response
to
local
residents
'
angry
criticism
,
admitted
that
the
emergency
response
to
the
accident
was
substandard
.


Two
separate
investigations
were
launched
.


One
inquiry
focused
on
the
fire
itself
,
while
the
other
sought
to
ascertain
criminal
responsibility
for
the
disaster
as
well
as
the
operation
of
the
illegal
factory
.


The
results
of
both
are
either
pending
or
have
yet
to
be
released
to
the
general
public
.


Aeroflot
Flight

The
collision
occurred
at
an
altitude
of
(
flight
level
130
)
.


Both
aircraft
lost
their
right
wings
and
tails
,
went
out
of
control
and
crashed
about
one
or
two
minutes
later
near
the
village
of
Zolochiv
,
Ukrainian
SSR
,
Soviet
Union
,
killing
all
94
people
on
both
aircraft
.


Civil
and
military
air
traffic
controllers
mislocated
both
aircraft
involved
,
leading
to
violations
of
air
traffic
control
rules
.


Among
the
victims
of
the
disaster
were
graphics
artist
Alexander
Aksinin
,
the
young
Estonian

The
Hexthorpe
rail
accident
occurred
on
16
September
1887
at
Hexthorpe
railway
platform
some
west
of
Doncaster
on
the
South
Yorkshire
Railway
line
to
Sheffield
and
Barnsley
.


The
platform
was
situated
within
a
block
section
between
Hexthorpe
Junction
and
Cherry
Tree
Lane
and
so
had
no
signals
of
its
own
.


The
railway
platform
was
a
simple
wooden
structure
on
the
Doncaster
-
bound
line
usually
used
for
the
collection
of
tickets
from
the
many
trains
arriving
in
the
town
for
the
St.
Leger
race
meeting
.


The
usual
method
of
working
the
section
of
line
was
to
pass
trains
from
Hexthorpe
Junction
under
a
'permissive
'
block
ruling
,
not
usually
used
on
passenger
lines
,
with
additional
control
by
two
flagmen
spaced
between
the
junction
box
and
the
ticket
platform
.


On
this
day
two
trains
were
in
the
section
,
the
first
,
a
Midland
Railway
train
,
stood
at
the
platform
,
the
second
,
another
Midland
train
waiting
just
to
its
rear
.


As
the
first
train
moved
off
the
second
moved
onto
the
platform
so
that
tickets
could
be
checked
.


The
third
train
was
a
Liverpool
to
Hull
express
worked
by
a
MS
&
LR
crew
and
probably
the
crew
who
should
have
understood
the
working
of
the
line
better
than
any
other
.


This
train
came
over
Hexthorpe
Junction
with
,
first
the
'distant
'
signal
and
then
the
'home
'
signal
at
danger
.


With
speed
down
to
a
crawl
the
'home
'
signal
was
lowered
,
the
driver
assumed
,
wrongly
,
that
with
no
other
fixed
signals
to
Cherry
Tree
Lane
his
route
was
clear
and
speed
gradually
rose
.


In
the
official
report
it
was
said
that
the
first
of
the
flagmen
gave
no
indication
and
the
second
gave
an
ambiguous
signal
which
was
seen
by
the
fireman
but
not
properly
understood
.


The
express
was
reported
travelling
between
35
and
40
m.p.h
.


when
they
rounded
the
curve
and
saw
the
Midland
train
still
in
the
platform
.


The
driver
applied
the
'simple
'
vacuum
brake
and
threw
the
locomotive
into
reverse
but
could
not
stop
within
the
short
distance
of
less
than
250
yards
.


The
trial
of
the
driver
and
fireman
at
York
,
before
the
Lord
Chief
Justice
was
the
first
big
legal
case
in
which
the
newly
formed
trade
union
A.S.L.E.F
.


were
part
and
for
which
they
engaged
eminent
counsel
to
defend
their
members
.


The
jury
returned
a
verdict
of
'not
guilty
'
and
the
Lord
Chief
Justice
said
in
his
summing
up
that
``
...
he
could
not
but
think
that
the
railway
company
was
seriously
to
blame
for
having
had
in
use
a
brake
which
not
only
was
not
the
best
in
existence
,
but
which
was
known
to
be
insufficient
and
liable
to
break
down
''
.


The
management
were
``
thick
skinned
''
over
all
safety
matters
and
in
this
case
Sir
Edward
Watkin
,
the
company
chairman
,
said
``
...
it
was
a
misfortune
that
the
Lord
Chief
Justice
should
have
exonerated
the
driver
and
fireman
''
.


Regardless
of
Sir
Edward
's
thinking
the
Hexthorpe
accident
,
closely
followed
by
the
Armagh
rail
disaster
in
Northern
Ireland
sounded
the
death
knell
of
the
'simple
'
vacuum
brake
.

Hammer
was
part
of
the
Iraq

The
four-hour
operation
netted
nine
detainees
and
38
illegal

.


Just
after

,
the
U.S.
troops
established
blocking
positions
around
the
neighborhood
while
the
Iraqi
units
fanned
out
through
the
narrow
streets
,
searching
houses
and
apartment
complexes
room-by-room
for
weapons
and
contraband
.


``
This
just
shows
the
commitment
of
the
Iraqi
Army
to
protecting
the
people
of
Adhamiyah
by
going
after
criminals
and
terrorists
who
want
to
create

The
colourful
opening
ceremony
was
held
in
the
Rizal
Memorial
Stadium
in
Manila
.


A
new
football
stadium
and
indoor
arena
was
built
in
Pasig
named
the
University
of
Life
Track
&
Field
and
Arena
or
the
ULTRA
,
now
called
the
PhilSports
Arena
.


The
adjacent
apartments
were
used
as
the
athlete
's
quarters
and
was
converted
into
a
``
BLISS
''
housing
project
of
First
Lady
Imelda
Marcos
.


The
final
medal
tally
was
led
by
Indonesia
,
followed
by

and

The
Markale
market
shelling
or
Markale
massacres
were
two
separate
bombardments
carried
out
by
the
Army
of
Republika
Srpska
targeting
civilians
during
the
Siege
of
Sarajevo
in
the
Bosnian
War
.


They
occurred
at
the
Markale
(
marketplace
)
located
in
the
historic
core
of
Sarajevo
,
the
capital
of
Bosnia
and
Herzegovina
.


The
first
occurred
on
5
February
1994
;
68
people
were
killed
and
144
more
were
wounded
by
a
mortar
.


The
second
occurred
on
28
August
1995
when
five
mortar
shells
killed
43
people
and
wounded
75
others
.


The
latter
attack
was
the
alleged
reason
for
NATO
air
strikes
against
Bosnian
Serb
forces
that
would
eventually
lead
to
the
Dayton
Peace
Accords
and
the
end
of
the
war
in
Bosnia
and
Herzegovina
.


The
responsibility
of
the
Army
of
the
Republika
Srpska
for
the
first
shelling
is
contested
.


since
investigations
to
establish
the
location
from
where
the
shells
had
been
fired
led
to
ambiguous
results
.


It
was
claimed
that
the
Bosnian
army
had
actually
shelled
its
own
people
in
order
to
provoke
intervention
of
Western
countries
on
their
side
.


The
International
Criminal
Tribunal
for
the
former
Yugoslavia
(
ICTY
)
in
its
appeal
judgement
of
Stanislav
Galić
in
2006
summarized
the
evidence
and
ruled
that
the
conclusion
that
the
shells
had
been
fired
from
a
location
occupied
by
Serbian
forces
was
a
reasonable
one
;
nevertheless
,
Radovan
Karadžić
during
his
trial
before
ICTY
tried
to
use
this
claim
to
his
defense
,
but
was
found
guilty
.


The
Shangani
Patrol
(
or
Wilson
's
Patrol
)
was
a
34-soldier
unit
of
the
British
South
Africa
Company
that
in
1893
was
ambushed
and
annihilated
by
more
than
3,000
Matabele
warriors
in
Rhodesia
(
now
Zimbabwe
)
,
during
the
First
Matabele
War
.


Headed
by
Major
Allan
Wilson
,
the
patrol
was
attacked
just
north
of
the
Shangani
River
in
Matabeleland
,
Rhodesia
.


Its
dramatic
last
stand
,
sometimes
called
``
Wilson
's
Last
Stand
''
,
achieved
a
prominent
place
in
the
British
public
imagination
and
,
subsequently
,
in
Rhodesian
history
,
similarly
to
events
such
as
the
Battle
of
The
Little
Bighorn
in
the
United
States
,
the
Battle
of
Shiroyama
in
Japan
,
the
Battle
of
the
Alamo
in
Texas
,
and
the
Greeks
'
last
stand
at
Thermopylae
.


The
patrol
comprised
elements
of
the
Mashonaland
Mounted
Police
and
the
Bechuanaland
Border
Police
.


Scouting
ahead
of
Major
Patrick
Forbes
's
column
attempting
the
capture
of
the
Matabele
King
Lobengula
(
following
his
flight
from
his
capital
Bulawayo
a
month
before
)
,
it
crossed
the
Shangani
late
on
3
December
1893
.


It
moved
on
Lobengula
the
next
morning
,
but
was
ambushed
by
a
host
of
Matabele
riflemen
and
warriors
near
the
king
's
wagon
.


Surrounded
and
outnumbered
about
a
hundred-fold
,
the
patrol
made
a
last
stand
as
three
of
its
number
broke
out
and
rode
back
to
the
river
to
muster
reinforcements
from
Forbes
.


However
,
the
Shangani
had
risen
significantly
in
flood
,
and
Forbes
was
himself
involved
in
a
skirmish
near
the
southern
bank
;
Wilson
and
his
men
therefore
remained
isolated
to
the
north
.


After
fighting
to
the
last
cartridge
,
and
killing
over
ten
times
their
own
number
,
they
were
annihilated
.


The
patrol
's
members
,
particularly
Wilson
and
Captain
Henry
Borrow
,
were
elevated
in
death
to
the
status
of
national
heroes
,
representing
endeavour
in
the
face
of
insurmountable
odds
.


The
anniversary
of
the
battle
on
4
December
1893
became
an
annual
public
holiday
in
Rhodesia
two
years
later
,
and
was
an
official
non-work
day
until
1920
.


A
historical
war
film
depicting
the
episode
,
``
Shangani
Patrol
''
,
was
produced
and
released
in
1970
.


Controversy
surrounds
the
breakout
before
the
last
stand—which
various
writers
have
posited
might
have
actually
been
desertion—and
a
box
of
gold
sovereigns
,
which
a
Matabele
``
inDuna
''
(
leader
)
later
claimed
had
been
given
to
two
unidentified
men
from
Forbes
's
rear
guard
on
2
December
,
along
with
a
message
that
Lobengula
admitted
defeat
and
wanted
the
column
to
stop
pursuing
him
.


Two
batmen
were
initially
found
guilty
of
accepting
the
gold
,
keeping
it
for
themselves
and
not
passing
on
the
message
,
but
the
evidence
against
them
was
inconclusive
and
largely
circumstantial
;
the
convictions
were
ultimately
overturned
.


The
Arab–Israeli
conflict
refers
to
the
political
tension
,
military
conflicts
and
disputes
between
Arab
countries
and
Israel
,
which
climaxed
during
the
20th
century
.


The
roots
of
the
Arab–Israeli
conflict
are
attributed
to
the
rise
of
Zionism
and
Arab
nationalism
towards
the
end
of
the
19th
century
,
though
the
two
national
movements
had
not
clashed
until
the
1920s
.


part
of
the
dispute
unk
from
the
conflicting
claims
to
the
land
.


Territory
regarded
by
the
Jewish
people
as
their
ancestral
homeland
is
at
the
same
time
regarded
by
the
Pan-Arab
movement
as
historically
and
currently
belonging
to
the
Arab
Palestinians
,
and
in
the
Pan-Islamic
context
,
as
Muslim
lands
.


the
sectarian
conflict
between
palestinian
jews
and
arabs
emerged
in
the
1920s
,
peaking
into
a
full-scale
civil
war
in
1947
and
transforming
into
the
first
unk
war
in
may
1948
,
following
the
israeli
declaration
of
independence
.


Large-scale
hostilities
mostly
ended
with
the
cease-fire
agreements
after
the
1973
Yom
Kippur
War
.


Peace
agreements
were
signed
between
Israel
and
Egypt
in
1979
,
resulting
in
Israeli
withdrawal
from
the
Sinai
Peninsula
and
abolishment
of
the
military
governance
system
in
the
West
Bank
and
Gaza
Strip
,
in
favor
of
Israeli
Civil
Administration
and
consequent
unilateral
annexation
of
the
Golan
Heights
and
East
Jerusalem
.


The
nature
of
the
conflict
has
shifted
over
the
years
from
the
large-scale
,
regional
Arab–Israeli
conflict
to
a
more
local
Israeli–Palestinian
conflict
,
which
peaked
during
the
1982
Lebanon
War
.


With
the
decline
of
the
First
Palestinian
Intifada
,
the
interim
Oslo
Accords
led
to
the
creation
of
the
Palestinian
National
Authority
in
1994
,
within
the
context
of
the
Israeli–Palestinian
peace
process
.


The
same
year
Israel
and
Jordan
reached
a
peace
accord
.


A
cease-fire
has
been
largely
maintained
between
Israel
and
Baathist
Syria
,
as
well
as
with
Lebanon
.


Despite
the
peace
agreements
with
Egypt
and
Jordan
,
interim
peace
accords
with
the
Palestinian
Authority
and
the
generally
existing
cease-fire
,
until
mid-2010s
the
Arab
League
and
Israel
had
remained
at
odds
with
each
other
over
many
issues
.


Developments
in
the
course
of
the
Syrian
Civil
War
reshuffled
the
situation
near
Israel
's
northern
border
,
putting
the
Syrian
Arab
Republic
,
Hezbollah
and
the
Syrian
opposition
at
odds
with
each
other
and
complicating
their
relations
with
Israel
,
upon
the
emerging
warfare
with
Iran
.


The
conflict
between
Israel
and
Hamas-ruled
Gaza
,
is
also
attributed
to
the
Iran–Israel
proxy
conflict
in
the
region
.


By
2017
,
Israel
and
several
Arab
Sunni
states
led
by
Saudi
Arabia
,
formed
a
semi-official
coalition
to
confront
Iran
-
a
move
which
some
marked
as
the
fading
of
the
Arab-Israeli
Conflict
.


The
Platine
War
(
18
August
1851
–
3
February
1852
)
was
fought
between
the
Argentine
Confederation
and
an
alliance
consisting
of
the
Empire
of
Brazil
,
Uruguay
,
and
the
Argentine
provinces
of
Entre
Ríos
and
Corrientes
.


The
war
was
part
of
a
long-running
dispute
between
Argentina
and
Brazil
for
influence
over
Uruguay
and
Paraguay
,
and
hegemony
over
the
Platine
region
(
areas
bordering
the
Río
de
la
Plata
)
.


The
conflict
took
place
in
Uruguay
and
northeastern
Argentina
,
and
on
the
Río
de
la
Plata
.


Uruguay
's
internal
troubles
,
including
the
long-running
Uruguayan
Civil
War
(
``
La
Guerra
Grande
''
–
``
The
Great
War
''
)
,
were
heavily
influential
factors
leading
to
the
Platine
War
.


In
1850
,
the
Platine
region
was
politically
unstable
.


although
the
governor
of
buenos
aires
,
juan
manuel
de
rosas
,
had
gained
dictatorial
control
over
other
argentine
provinces
,
his
rule
was
plagued
by
a
series
of
regional
rebellions
.


Meanwhile
,
Uruguay
struggled
with
its
own
civil
war
,
which
started
after
gaining
independence
from
the
Brazilian
Empire
in
1828
in
the
Cisplatine
War
.


Rosas
backed
the
Uruguayan
Blanco
party
in
this
conflict
,
and
further
desired
to
extend
Argentine
borders
to
areas
formerly
occupied
by
the
Spanish
Viceroyalty
of
the
Río
de
la
Plata
.


This
meant
asserting
control
over
Uruguay
,
Paraguay
,
and
Bolivia
.


This
threatened
Brazilian
interests
and
sovereignty
since
the
old
Spanish
Viceroyalty
had
also
included
territories
which
had
long
been
incorporated
into
the
Brazilian
province
of
Rio
Grande
do
Sul
.


Brazil
actively
pursued
ways
to
eliminate
the
threat
from
Rosas
.


In
1851
,
it
allied
with
the
Argentine
breakaway
provinces
of
Corrientes
and
Entre
Rios
(
led
by
Justo
José
de
Urquiza
)
,
and
the
anti-Rosas
Colorado
party
in
Uruguay
.


Brazil
next
secured
the
south-western
flank
by
signing
defensive
alliances
with
Paraguay
and
Bolivia
.


Faced
with
an
offensive
alliance
against
his
regime
,
Rosas
declared
war
on
Brazil
.


Allied
forces
first
advanced
into
Uruguayan
territory
,
defeating
Rosas
'
Blanco
party
supporters
led
by
Manuel
Oribe
.


Afterwards
,
the
Allied
army
was
divided
,
with
the
main
arm
advancing
by
land
to
engage
Rosas
'
main
defenses
and
the
other
launching
a
seaborne
assault
directed
at
Buenos
Aires
.


The
Platine
War
ended
in
1852
with
the
Allied
victory
at
the
Battle
of
Caseros
,
for
some
time
establishing
Brazilian
hegemony
over
much
of
South
America
.


The
war
ushered
in
a
period
of
economic
and
political
stability
in
the
Empire
of
Brazil
.


With
Rosas
gone
,
Argentina
began
a
political
process
which
would
result
in
a
more
unified
state
.


However
,
the
end
of
the
Platine
war
did
not
completely
resolve
issues
within
the
Platine
region
.


Turmoil
continued
in
subsequent
years
,
with
internal
disputes
among
political
factions
in
Uruguay
,
a
long
civil
war
in
Argentina
,
and
an
emergent
Paraguay
asserting
its
claims
.


Two
more
major
international
wars
(
see
:
Paraguayan
War
)
followed
during
the
next
two
decades
,
sparked
by
territorial
ambitions
and
conflicts
over
influence
.


The
2009
Palma
Nova
bombing
occurred
on
July
30
,
2009
,
when
a
limpet
bomb
went
off
outside
a
Civil
Guard
barracks
in
the
town
of
Palma
Nova
,
Majorca
,
Spain
.


The
bomb
was
placed
under
a
patrol
car
and
two
Civil
Guard
officers
died
as
a
result
of
the
explosion
.


A
second
device
was
found
under
another
Civil
Guard
vehicle
at
nearby
barracks
and
safely
exploded
by
police
.


On
August
9
,
the
Basque
nationalist
and
separatist
organisation
ETA
claimed
responsibility
for
the
attack
,
while
four
other
bombs
exploded
around
restaurants
and
shopping
centres
in
Palma
,
Majorca
,
causing
no
injuries
.


The
bombing
was
ETA
's
first
attack
in
Majorca
since
it
tried
to
kill
King
Juan
Carlos
I
in
the
summer
of
1995
,
and
its
deadliest
attack
since
it
killed
two
Civil
Guard
officers
in
Capbreton
,
France
in
2007
.


The
attack
came
on
the
eve
of
the
50th
anniversary
of
ETA
's
founding
,
and
days
before
the
King
's
yearly
visit
to
Majorca
.


The
2002
Indoor
Cricket
World
Cup
was
an
Indoor
Cricket
tournament
that
took
place
in
Wellington
,
New
Zealand
from
30
September
to
6
October
2002
involving
both
a
men
's
and
a
women
's
division
.


There
were
a
total
of
17
matches
played
in
the
men
's
division
and
14
matches
played
in
the
women
's
division
.


In
the
men
's
division
a
round
robin
tournament
was
played
with
each
team
playing
the
other
once
in
order
to
rank
the
sides
.


All
five
teams
then
competed
in
the
finals
,
with
Australia
eventually
defeating
New
Zealand
in
the
final
itself
.


This
win
represented
their
4th
World
Cup
title
in
succession
and
was
despite
losing
their
first
ever
World
Cup
game
to
New
Zealand
in
the
major
semi
final
.


The
women
's
division
also
featured
a
round
robin
tournament
,
though
each
of
the
four
sides
played
each
other
twice
.


at
the
conclusion
of
the
round
robin
games
,
the
highest
ranked
side
(
in
this
case
,
australia
)
progressed
through
to
the
final
leaving
2nd
and
3rd
place
(
new
zealand
and
sri
lanka
)
to
contest
the
semi
final
.


Australia
defeated
New
Zealand
in
the
final
,
claiming
their
3rd
World
Cup
title
in
succession
.


The
event
was
marred
by
the
late
withdrawal
of
South
Africa
from
both
divisions
,
a
decision
that
would
have
significant
repercussions
for
the
South
African
national
body
.


Gordon
Hill
(
born
31
January

)
,
better
known
as
The
Wealdstone
Raider
,
is
an
English
builder
who
later
gained
prominence
as
an
Internet
meme
.


A
long-time
supporter
of
Wealdstone
F.C.
,
he
gained
attention
due
to
a
humorous
viral
video
of
him
heckling
opposing
supporters
of
Whitehawk
F.C
.


at
a
football
match
in
March
2013

which
ultimately
ended
in
a
1–1
draw
,
with
phrases
such
as
``
You

and
``

However
,
the

did
not
reach
its
peak
in

by
BBC

included
The
Wealdstone

in
the
'top

'
of

The
nickname
``

came
from
the

The
Twelfth
Siege
of
Gibraltar
was
fought
between
September
1704
and
May
1705
during
the
War
of
the
Spanish
Succession
.


It
followed
the
capture
in
August
1704
of
the
fortified
town
of
Gibraltar
,
at
the
southern
tip
of
Spain
,
by
an

led
by
Sir
George

Alliance
,
Holy
Roman
Empire
,
England
,
the

Portugal
and
the

,
had
allied
to
prevent
the
unification
of

by
supporting
the
claim
of
the
Habsburg
pretender
Archduke

,
when
Portugal
joined
the
confederate
powers
.


From
then
,
English
naval
attentions
were
focused
on
mounting
a
campaign
in
the
Mediterranean
to
distract
the
French
navy
and
disrupt
French
and
Bourbon
Spanish
shipping
or
capture
a
port
for
use
as
a
naval
base
.


The
capture
of
Gibraltar
was
the
outcome
of
that
initial
stage
of
the
Mediterranean
campaign
.


At
the
start
of
the
siege
,
Gibraltar
was
garrisoned
by
around
2,000
Dutch
,
English
,
Austrian
and
pro-Habsburg
Spanish
troops
facing
a
besieging
force
of
up
to
8,000
French
,
pro-Bourbon
Spanish
and
Irish
troops
.


The
defenders
were
able
to
hold
off
the
numerically
superior
besieging
force
through
exploiting
Gibraltar
's
geography
and
the
small
town
's
fortifications
,
though
they
were
frequently
short
of
manpower
and
ammunition
.


The
besiegers
were
undermined
by
disputes
between
the
French
and
Spanish
officers
and
terrible
conditions
in
their
trenches
and
bastions
,
which
led
to
outbreaks
of
epidemic
disease
and
undermined
morale
.


Sea
power
proved
crucial
,
as
the
French
navy
sought
unsuccessfully
to
prevent
the
Grand
Alliance
shipping
in
fresh
troops
,
ammunition
and
food
.


Three
naval
battles
were
fought
during
the
siege
,
two
of
which
were
clear
defeats
for
the
French
and
the
last
of
which
resulted
in
the
siege
being
abandoned
as
hopeless
after
nine
months
of
fruitless
shelling
.


The
outcome
was
disastrous
for
the
French
and
Bourbon
Spanish
side
,
which
was
said
to
have
lost
10,000
men
against
only
400
for
the
Grand
Alliance
.


Between
26
November
1972
and
20
January
1973
,
there
were
four
paramilitary
bombings
in
the
centre
of
Dublin
,
Ireland
.


Three
civilians
were
killed
and
185
people
were
injured
.


No
group
ever
claimed
responsibility
for
the
attacks
and
nobody
was
ever
charged
in
connection
with
the
bombings
.


the
first
bombing
in
burgh
quay
may
have
been
carried
out
by
former
associates
of
the
littlejohn
brothers
who
were
secret
intelligence
service
provocateurs
,
in
a
successful
attempt
to
provoke
an
irish
government
clampdown
against
the
provisional
ira
,
while
the
other
three
bombings
were
possibly
perpetrated
by
loyalist
paramilitaries
,
specifically
the
ulster
volunteer
force
(
uvf
)
,
with
british
military
or
intelligence
assistance
.


The
UVF
claimed
in
1993
to
have
carried
out
the
1974
Dublin
and
Monaghan
bombings
which
incurred
the
greatest
loss
of
life
in
a
single
day
throughout
the
30-year
conflict
known
as
the
Troubles
.


On
1
December
1972
,
when
two
separate
car
bombs
exploded
in
Eden
Quay
and
Sackville
Place
,
Dáil
Éireann
was
debating
a
bill
to
amend
the
``
Offences
Against
the
State
Act
''
which
would
enact
stricter
measures
against
the
Provisional
IRA
and
other
paramilitary
groups
.


As
a
result
of
the
two
bombings
,
which
killed
two
men
and
wounded
131
,
the
Dáil
voted
for
the
amendment
,
which
introduced
special
emergency
powers
to
combat
the
IRA
.


It
is
believed
that
the
26
November
and
1
December
bombings
were
executed
to
influence
the
outcome
of
the
voting
.


Irish
Supreme
Court
Justice
Henry
Barron
commissioned
an
official
inquiry
into
the
bombings
.


The
findings
were
published
in
a
report
in
November
2004
.


Chemistry
:
The
Tour
was
the
second
concert
tour
by
British
all-female
pop
group
Girls
Aloud
.


It
supported
their
third
studio
album
,
``
Chemistry
''
.


Following
the
success
of
2005
's
What
Will
the
Neighbours
Say
?


Live
,
Girls
Aloud
performed
in
arenas
across
the
United
Kingdom
for
the
first
time
.


Girls
Aloud
announced
tour
dates
in
October
2005
.


They
performed
just
ten
dates
,
making
it
their
shortest
tour
.


The
tour
began
in
Nottingham
on
22
May
2006
and
concluded
in
London
on
3
June
2006
.


The
show
was
divided
into
five
sections
with
distinct
costumes
,
including
the
encore
.


The
set
list
featured
songs
mostly
from
``
Chemistry
''
,
but
also
included
singles
from
Girls
Aloud
's
first
two
albums
and
cover
versions
.


Girls
Aloud
began
the
show
by
rising
from
underneath
the
stage
to
perform
the
opening
number
``
Biology
''
.


The
stage
included
video
screens
and
a
catwalk
which
extended
into
the
audience
.


Chemistry
Tour
received
generally
positive
reviews
from
contemporary
music
critics
who
praised
Girls
Aloud
's
energy
and
fun
.


The
tour
was
a
commercial
success
,
leading
to
the
announcement
of
another
arena
tour
the
following
year
.


A
recording
of
the
show
was
released
on
DVD
in
November
2006
,
oddly
titled
Girls

:
Greatest

Severe
Tropical
Cyclone
Sina
was
the
only
named
tropical
cyclone
to
develop
within
the
South
Pacific
basin
during
the
1990–91
season
.


The
system
was
first
noted
as
a
shallow
depression
within
the
South
Pacific
Convergence
Zone
to
the
west
of
Wallis
Island
.


over
the
next
three
days
the
system
moved
towards
the
west-northwest
,
before
it
was
named
sina
during
november
24
,
after
it
had
developed
into
a
tropical
cyclone
.


over
the
next
couple
of
days
the
system
intensified
further
and
developed
an
eye
feature
as
it
erratically
moved
towards
fiji
.


Sina
subsequently
peaked
in
intensity
during
November
26
,
before
the
system
passed
through
the
Fijian
Islands
over
the
next
two
days
as
it
started
to
gradually
weaken
.


Sina
subsequently
passed
just
to
the
north
of
Tongatapu
in
Tonga
during
November
29
,
before
it
passed
about
160
km
(
100
mi
)
to
the
south
of
Niue
and
near
the
Southern
Cook
Islands
during
the
next
day
.


The
system
subsequently
rapidly
weakened
and
became
an
extratropical
cyclone
during
December
1
,
before
they
were
absorbed
by
an
advancing
trough
of
low
pressure
near
50°S
on
December
4
.


The
cyclone
caused
no
deaths
and
over
in
damages
,
as
it
affected
Fiji
,
Tonga
,
Niue
and
the
Southern
Cook
Islands
.


Ahead
of
the
system
affecting
Fiji
,
hundreds
of
people
were
evacuated
from
Fiji
's
outer
island
resorts
to
hotels
on
the
mainland
.


High
winds
and
heavy
rain
forced
the
closure
of
several
local
airports
and
the
main
Nadi
International
Airport
.


As
Sina
moved
through
the
archipelago
,
the
system
destroyed
or
damaged
houses
and
other
building
structures
,
while
bringing
down
electric
and
telephone
lines
and
uprooting
trees
.


The
system
also
washed
away
a
railway
bridge
on
Vanua
Levu
that
was
used
to
take
sugar
cane
to
Labasa
's
mills
,
leaving
growers
no
choice
but
to
go
through
the
village
of
Korowiri
.


However
,
the
workers
refused
to
go
into
their
fields
unless
they
had
police
protection
to
go
through
the
village
,
after
Methodists
from
the
local
church
attacked
a
group
of
growers
for
working
on
Sundays
in
defiance
of
Fiji
's
Sunday
Observance
Decree
.


Within
Tonga
only
minor
damage
to
weak
structures
,
trees
,
banana
plantations
,
electric
and
telephone
lines
was
recorded
.


Within
both
Niue
and
the
Southern
Cook
Islands
only
minor
damage
to
crops
and
structures
was
reported
.


The
events
surrounding
the
formation
of
the
United
Kingdom
's
government
in
2010
took
place
between
7
May
and
12
May
2010
,
following
the
2010
general
election
,
which
failed
to
produce
an
overall
majority
for
any
of
the
country
's
three
main
political
parties
.


The
election
,
held
on
6
May
,
resulted
in
the
first
hung
parliament
in
the
UK
in
36
years
,
sparking
a
series
of
negotiations
which
would
form
the
first
coalition
government
since
the
Second
World
War
.


The
governing
Labour
administration
led
by
Gordon
Brown
was
defeated
in
the
election
and
lost
its
overall
majority
after
13
years
in
office
.


The
opposition
Conservatives
led
by
David
Cameron
won
the
largest
number
of
seats
in
the
new
Parliament
,
but
fell
short
of
the
number
required
to
secure
an
overall
majority
.


Consequently
,
senior
figures
from
both
parties
embarked
on
a
series
of
make-or-break
meetings
with
representatives
from
the
Liberal
Democrats
led
by
Nick
Clegg
,
aimed
at
forming
a
coalition
government
.


As
leader
of
the
third
largest
party
,
Clegg
had
announced
that
the
Liberal
Democrats
would
enter
talks
with
whichever
party
held
the
greater
number
of
seats
.


A
series
of
meetings
with
the
Conservatives
began
shortly
after
the
hung
parliament
was
announced
,
and
continued
over
the
weekend
after
the
election
.


negotiations
were
also
held
with
the
labour
party
.


the
scottish
national
party
signalled
its
willingness
to
join
labour
and
the
liberal
democrats
in
government
as
part
of
a
rainbow
coalition
,
but
it
quickly
became
clear
that
gordon
brown
's
continued
presence
as
prime
minister
was
seen
as
a
major
obstacle
to
formulating
a
unk
democrat
deal
.


although
brown
relinquished
his
role
as
labour
leader
on
10
may
,
the
party
failed
to
reach
an
agreement
with
the
liberal
democrats
;
the
latter
instead
struck
a
deal
with
the
conservatives
the
following
day
.


Brown
resigned
as
Prime
Minister
on
the
evening
of
11
May
,
and
the
Conservative–Liberal
Democrat
Coalition
government
led
by
David
Cameron
took
office
shortly
thereafter
.


The
Liberal
Democrats
emerged
from
a
meeting
of
their
Parliamentary
party
and
Federal
Executive
to
announce
that
the
coalition
deal
had
been
``
approved
overwhelmingly
''
shortly
after
midnight
on
12
May
,
and
later
the
same
day
the
two
parties
published
the
Conservative
–
Liberal
Democrat
coalition
agreement
setting
out
the
terms
of
their
deal
.


While
Cameron
became
Prime
Minister
,
Liberal
Democrat
leader
Nick
Clegg
was
appointed
as
Deputy
Prime
Minister
.


Get
Your
Sting
and
Blackout
World
Tour
is
a
worldwide
concert
tour
by
German
rock
band
Scorpions
.


It
follows
the
release
of
the
album
``
Sting
in
the
Tail
''
.


The
European
dates
were
followed
by
dates
in
North
America
,
South
America
,
Asia
,
and
Africa
.


Shortly
before
the
tour
began
,
members
of
the
Scorpions
announced
that
this
would
be
their
last
world
tour
before
retirement
.


However
,
they
have
retracted
this
decision
.


The
successive
tour

crashed
during
the
final
minutes
of
an
air
show
at
the
marine

in
beaufort
,
south

.


The
sole
fatality
was
the
pilot
,
Lieutenant
Commander
Kevin

Davis
.


The
body
of
the
pilot
and
the
flight
recorder
were
recovered
and
moved
to
the
local
coroner
's
office
.


Eight
nearby
residents
were
injured
by
flying
debris
.


A
report
was
released
on
January
15
,
2008
,
ending
the
investigation
by
the
Navy
into
the
crash
.


The
report
states
that
when
Lieutenant
Commander
Davis
pulled
back
into
a
6.8-
''

pull
,
he
lost
control
of
the
aircraft
due

Operation
Anklet
was
the
codename
given
to
a
British
Commando
raid
during
the
Second
World
War
.


The
raid
on
the
Lofoten
Islands
was
carried
out
in
December
1941
,
by
300
men
from
No
.


12
Commando
and
the
Norwegian
Independent
Company
1
.


The
landing
party
was
supported
by
22
ships
from
three
navies
.


at
the
same
time
,
another
raid
was
taking
place
in
UNK
.


This
raid
was
Operation
Archery
,
on
27
December
1941
,
and
Operation
Anklet
was
seen
as
a
diversionary
raid
for
this
bigger
raid
,
intended
to
draw
away
the
German
naval
and
air
forces
.


The
1975
Australian
constitutional
crisis
,
also
known
simply
as
the
Dismissal
,
has
been
described
as
the
greatest
political
and
constitutional
crisis
in
Australian
history
.


it
culminated
on
11
november
1975
with
the
dismissal
from
office
of
the
prime
minister
,
gough
whitlam
of
the
australian
labor
party
(
alp
)
,
by
governor-general
sir
john
kerr
,
who
then
commissioned
the
leader
of
the
opposition
,
malcolm
fraser
of
the
liberal
party
,
as
caretaker
prime
minister
.


whitlam
's
labor
government
had
been
elected
in
1972
with
a
small
majority
in
the
house
of
representatives
,
but
with
the
senate
balance
of
power
being
held
by
the
democratic
labor
party
who
usually
supported
the
liberal-country
opposition
.


Another
election
in
1974
resulted
in
little
change
.


While
the
Whitlam
Government
introduced
many
new
policies
and
programs
,
it
was
also
rocked
by
scandals
and
political
miscalculations
.


in
october
1975
,
the
opposition
used
its
control
of
the
senate
to
defer
passage
of
appropriation
bills
(
needed
to
finance
government
expenditure
)
,
that
had
been
passed
by
the
house
of
representatives
.


the
opposition
stated
that
they
would
continue
their
stance
unless
whitlam
called
an
election
for
the
house
of
representatives
,
and
urged
kerr
to
dismiss
whitlam
unless
he
agreed
to
their
demand
.


Whitlam
believed
that
Kerr
would
not
dismiss
him
,
and
Kerr
did
nothing
to
disabuse
Whitlam
of
this
notion
.


On
11
November
1975
,
Whitlam
intended
to
call
a
half-Senate
election
in
an
attempt
to
break
the
deadlock
.


When
he
went
to
seek
Kerr
's
approval
of
the
election
,
Kerr
instead
dismissed
him
as
Prime
Minister
and
shortly
thereafter
installed
Fraser
in
his
place
.


Acting
quickly
before
all
ALP
parliamentarians
became
aware
of
the
change
of
government
,
Fraser
and
his
allies
were
able
to
secure
passage
of
the
appropriation
bills
,
and
Kerr
dissolved
Parliament
for
a
double
dissolution
election
.


Fraser
and
his
government
were
returned
with
a
massive
majority
in
the
election
held
the
following
month
.


The
events
of
the
Dismissal
led
to
only
minor
constitutional
change
.


The
Senate
retained
its
power
to
block
supply
,
and
the
Governor-General
the
power
to
dismiss
government
ministers
.


However
,
these
powers
have
not
since
been
used
to
force
a
government
from
office
.


Kerr
was
widely
criticised
by
Labor
supporters
for
his
actions
,
resigned
early
as
Governor-General
,
and
lived
much
of
his
remaining
life
abroad
.


The
2019
Southeast
Asian
Games
,
officially
known
as
the
30th
Southeast
Asian
Games
(
``
Filipino
:
Ika-30
Palaro
ng
Timog-Silangang
Asya
''
)
or
2019
SEA
Games
and
commonly
known
as
Philippines
2019
will
be
the
30th
edition
of
the
Southeast
Asian
Games
,
a
biennial
regional
multi-sport
event
which
will
be
hosted
by
the
Philippines
from
30
November
to
11
December
2019
.


For
this
edition
of
the
Games
,
four
designated
hubs
will
serve
as
hosts
namely
Manila
,
Clark
,
Subic
,
and
a
fourth
cluster
consisting
of
venues
not
grouped
with
the
first
three
hubs
.


This
will
be
the
fourth
time
that
the
Philippines
will
host
the
games
and
its
first
time
since
2005
.


Previously
,
it
had
also
hosted
the
1981
and
1991
editions
of
the
games
.


This
edition
is
most
notable
for
being
the
first
edition
to
include
e-sports
and
obstacle
course
as
well
as
having
the
highest
number
of
sports
in
the
history
of
the
games
,
at
56
.


The
hosting
rights
were
originally
awarded
to
Brunei
Darussalam
,
but
the
country
pulled
out
days
before
the
2015
Southeast
Asian
Games
due
to
``
financial
and
logistical
reasons
.
''


The
Philippines
was
set
to
host
the
games
,
after
Brunei
's
withdrawal
.


However
,
the
Philippines
'
hosting
was
left
uncertain
following
the
withdrawal
of
government
support
on
July
2017
as
it
plans
to
use
the
funds
intended
for
the
games
on
the
rehabilitation
of
Marawi
after
being
occupied
by
ISIS
supporters
.


Thailand
,
Indonesia
was
willing
to
step
in
if
no
other
countries
expressed
interest
to
host
.


Eventually
,
the
Philippines
reversed
its
withdrawal
of
support
and
announced
that
it
accepted
the
hosting
of
the
Games
on
16
August
2017
.


The
country
's
hosting
of
the
30th
SEA
Games
is
considered
as
a
stepping
stone
for
its
possible
bid
to
host
the
2030
Asian
Games
.


The
1971
Southeast
Asian
Peninsular
Games
,
officially
known
as
the
6th
Southeast
Asian
Peninsular
Games
,
was
a
Southeast
Asian
multi-sport
event
held
in
Kuala
Lumpur
,
Malaysia
from
6
to
13
December
1971
with
15
sports
featured
in
the
games
.


In
this
edition
of
the
games
,
host
country
Malaysia
joined
Singapore
in
pressuring
Thailand
to
let
the
SEAP
Games
Federation
expand
to
include
the
Philippines
and
Indonesia
,
but
to
no
avail
.


Thai
officials
felt
that
such
expansion
would
be
contrary
to
the
small
family
affair
they
had
intended
the
games
to
be
,
and
would
not
be
in
keeping
with
the
close-neighbours
spirit
the
games
was
supposed
to
cultivate
.


This
was
the
second
time
Malaysia
hosted
the
games
and
its
first
time
since
1965
.


The
games
was
opened
and
closed
by
Abdul
Halim
,
the
King
of
Malaysia
at
the
Stadium
Merdeka
.


The
final
medal
tally
was
led
by
Thailand
,
followed
by
host
Malaysia
and
Singapore
.


Operation
Corridor
92
(
,
``
Operacija
Koridor
92
''
)
was
the
largest
operation
conducted
during
the
Bosnian
War
by
the
Army
of
Republika
Srpska
(
VRS
)
against
the
forces
of
the
Croatian
Defence
Council
(
HVO
)
and
the
Croatian
Army
(
HV
)
in
the
Bosanska
Posavina
region
of
northern
Bosnia
and
Herzegovina
between
24
June
and
6
October
1992
.


The
objective
of
the
offensive
was
to
re-establish
a
road
link
between
the
city
of
Banja
Luka
in
the
west
of
the
country
and
the
eastern
parts
of
the
territory
controlled
by
the
Bosnian
Serbs
.


The
offensive
was
prompted
by
the
capture
of
Derventa
by
the
HV
and
the
HVO
–
a
move
that
blocked
the
single
overland
road
between
the
VRS-controlled
territories
.


The
VRS
successfully
recaptured
Derventa
and
pushed
the
HVO
and
the
HV
north
,
capturing
several
towns
in
the
process
.


In
the
second
phase
of
the
offensive
,
the
VRS
reached
the
Sava
River
,
the
border
with
Croatia
,
and
destroyed
a
bridgehead
held
by
the
HV
and
the
HVO
at
Bosanski
Brod
.


The
offensive
involved
more
than
60,000
troops
and
resulted
in
heavy
casualties
for
all
sides
,
especially
the
HVO
.


The
Croatian
National
Defence
Council
commissioned
a
report
into
the
loss
of
Bosanska
Posavina
and
blamed
internal
conflicts
,
a
double
chain
of
command
and
ineffective
counterintelligence
for
the
defeat
.


The
outcome
later
caused
speculation
that
it
was
the
result
of
a
political
arrangement
between
Serb
and
Croatian
leaders
to
secure
a
land
trade
,
though
a
Central
Intelligence
Agency
analysis
rejected
such
allegations
.


temples

tour
was
a
concert
tour
by
bob
dylan
.


He
was
supported
on
the
tour
by
Tom
Petty
and
the
Heartbreakers
.


The
tour
started
with
two
concerts
in
Israel
and
covered
various
European
countries
,
culminating
in
four
concerts
at
Wembley
Arena
in
London
,
England
.


Roger
McGuinn
was
the
opening
act
for
this
tour
(
who
was
also
supported
by
Tom
Petty
and
the
Heartbreakers
)
.


This
was
the
last
time
that
Dylan
has
toured
with
Tom
Petty
and
the
last
tour
before
beginning
the
Never
Ending
Tour
.


Dylan
and

briefly
united
in
Holmdel
,
New

in
the
summer
of
2003
.


The
2007
Songkhla
bombings
took
place
in
Songkhla
Province
,
Thailand
on
27
and
28
May
2007
,
and
are
believed
to
be
part
of
the
ongoing
south
Thailand
insurgency
.


At
least
four
people
were
killed
and
36
were
injured
.


The
explosions
started
in
Hat
Yai
when
a
string
of
seven
bomb
blasts
that
injured
13
people
in
Hat
Yai
.


Most
of
the
bombs
were
hidden
in
garbage
bins
and
detonated
nearly
at
the
same
time
starting
at
21:00
.


But
one
bomb
was
hurled
into
JB
Hat
Yai
Hotel
and
another
exploded
in
front
of
Hat
Yai
Garden
Hotel
.


The
following
day
,
a
bomb
exploded
in
front
of
a
busy
market
in
the
Saba
Yoi
.


The
bomb
,
which
exploded
shortly
after
16:00
,
was
hidden
in
a
motorcycle
parked
in
front
of
the
market
next
to
a
railway
station
.


The
motorcycle
was
destroyed
by
the
blast
,
and
a
nearby
car
damaged
,
as
were
dozens
of
stalls
belonging
to
fruit
and
vegetable
vendors
.


The
bombs
were
the
first
terrorist
attacks
in
Songkhla
since
the
south
Thailand
insurgency
reignited
in
November
2004
.


The
Sonning
Cutting
railway
accident
occurred
during
the
early
hours
of
24
December
1841
in
the
Sonning
Cutting
through
Sonning
Hill
,
near
Reading
,
Berkshire
.


A
Great
Western
Railway
(
GWR
)
luggage
train
travelling
from
London
Paddington
to
Bristol
Temple
Meads
station
entered
Sonning
Cutting
.


The
train
comprised
the
broad-gauge
locomotive
``
Hecla
''
,
a
tender
,
three
third-class
passenger
carriages
and
some
heavily
laden
goods
waggons
.


The
passenger
carriages
were
between
the
tender
and
the
goods
waggons
.


Recent
heavy
rain
had
saturated
the
soil
in
the
cutting
causing
it
to
slip
,
covering
the
line
on
which
the
train
was
travelling
.


On
running
into
the
slipped
soil
the
engine
was
derailed
,
causing
it
to
slow
rapidly
.


The
passenger
coaches
were
crushed
between
the
goods
waggons
and
the
tender
.


Eight
passengers
died
at
the
scene
and
seventeen
were
injured
seriously
,
one
of
whom
died
later
in
hospital
.


Details
of
the
accident
and
subsequent
proceedings
were
reported
widely
by
the
newspapers
of
the
day
.


The
Internal
conflict
in
Azawad
has
been
a
two-year-long
insurgency
in
Northern
Mali
between
a
pro-independence
ultra
Nationalist
group
,
the
MNLA
and
a
coalition
of
Islamists
terror
groups
.


The
conflict
began
when
Northern
Mali
declared
itself
independent
from
the
government
creating
the
un-recognized
state
of
Azawad
.


Both
the
Islamists
and
MNLA
formed
an
alliance
in
combatting
the
Malian
government
.


An
internal
conflict
sprung
up
over
the
imposing
of
sharia
law
in
the
new
state
and
the
MNLA
distancing
itself
from
the
coalition
to
a
democratic
state
.


Islamists
gained
popularity
amongst
anti-Tuareg
tribes
that
helped
it
overthrow
MNLA
authority
in
Gao
.


Both
sides
clashed
repeatedly
leading
to
the
Battle
of
Gao
where
the
MNLA
were
driven
from
the
North
's
two
main
cities
,
Gao
and
Timbuktu
.


The
MNLA
soon
lost
all
of
its
strongholds
in
the
North
in
a
matter
of
months
.


They
went
into
hiding
secretly
gaining
support
and
strength
.


The
beginning
of
2013
led
the
start
of
the
French
intervention
in
Mali
that
ousted
the
Islamists
from
the
North
's
cities
and
brought
back
Malian
authority
.


The
MNLA
supported
the
French
and
Chadian
forces
in
military
operations
against
Islamists
sanctuaries
in
the
mountains
.


The
MNLA
recaptured
several
important
towns
in
the
Kidal
Region
but
refused
to
dis-arm
or
hand
them
over
to
the
Malian
government
.


A
series
of
Islamists
sponsored
terror
attacks
plagued
MNLA
forces
for
siding
with
the
French
.


Checkpoints
and
bases
were
targeted
with
suicide
bombings
that
targeted
MNLA
members
.


A
peace
deal
was
reached
with
the
Malian
army
in
June
that
let
the
army
transverse
freely
in
MNLA
occupied
zones
that
were
under
Malian
jurisdiction
.


Ethnic
violence
sprung
over
the
murder
of
a
Tuareg
Government
officers
family
.


The
MNLA
responded
by
harassing
and
murdering
Fulani
civilians
who
create
a
majority
of
Islamists
rebels
.


The
Islamists
stepped
up
their
attacks
in
one
such
instance
massacring
30
Tuareg
merchants
.


The
MNLA
has
since
been
battling
Islamists
.


Mabila
(
also
spelled
Mavila
,
Mavilla
,
or
Mauvilla
)
was
a
small
fortress
town
known
to
Chief
Tuskaloosa
in
1540
,
in
a
region
of
present-day
central
Alabama
.


The
exact
location
has
been
debated
for
centuries
,
but
southwest
of
present-day
Selma
,
Alabama
,
is
one
possibility
.


Mabila
was
a
Trojan
horse
,
constructed
as
a
fake
village
.


It
concealed
more
than
2500
native
warriors
,
who
had
been
gathered
in
1540
by
their
chief
to
attack
a
large
part
of
invaders
in
the
Muskogee
territory
:
Spanish
explorer
Hernando
de
Soto
and
his
expedition
.


When
Hernando
de
Soto
had
first
met
Tuskaloosa
at
his
home
village
,
and
asked
him
for
supplies
,
Tuskaloosa
advised
them
to
travel
to
another
of
his
towns
,
known
as
``
Mabila
''
,
where
supplies
would
be
waiting
.


A
native
messenger
was
sent
ahead
to
Mabila
.


When
Tuskaloosa
arrived
with
the
first
group
of
Spaniards
,
he
asked
the
Spanish
people
to
leave
.


When
a
fight
broke
out
between
one
soldier
and
a
native
,
many
hidden
warriors
emerged
from
houses
and
began
shooting
arrows
.


The
Spaniards
fled
,
leaving
their
possessions
inside
the
fortress
.


The
full
conflict
that
resulted
is
called
the
Battle
of
Mabila
.


Hurricane
Leslie
was
an
Atlantic
tropical
cyclone
that
had
minor
effects
in
Bermuda
and
Atlantic
Canada
in
September
2012
.


The
twelfth
tropical
cyclone
of
the
annual
hurricane
season
,
Leslie
developed
from
a
tropical
wave
located
nearly
east
of
the
Leeward
Islands
on
August
30
.


about
twelve
hours
later
,
it
strengthened
into
tropical
storm
leslie
.


Tracking
steadily
west-northwestward
,
it
slowly
intensified
due
to
only
marginally
favorable
conditions
.


By
September
2
,
the
storm
curved
north-northwestward
while
located
north
of
the
Leeward
Islands
.


Thereafter
,
a
blocking
pattern
over
Atlantic
Canada
caused
Leslie
to
drift
for
four
days
.


Late
on
September
5
,
Leslie
was
upgraded
to
a
Category
1
hurricane
.


However
,
due
to
its
slow
movement
,
the
storm
causing
upwelling
,
which
decreased
sea
surface
temperatures
(
SST
's
)
,
weakening
Leslie
back
to
a
tropical
storm
on
September
7
.


The
storm
drifted
until
September
9
,
when
it
accelerated
while
passing
east
of
Bermuda
.


Relatively
strong
winds
on
the
island
caused
hundreds
of
power
outages
and
knocked
down
tree
branches
,
electrical
poles
,
and
other
debris
.


Slight
re-intensification
took
place
,
with
Leslie
becoming
a
hurricane
again
,
before
transitioning
into
an
extratropical
cyclone
near
Newfoundland
on
September
11
.


In
Atlantic
Canada
,
the
storm
brought
heavy
rainfall
to
both
Nova
Scotia
and
Newfoundland
.


In
the
latter
,
localized
flooding
occurred
,
especially
in
the
western
portions
of
the
province
.


Also
in
Newfoundland
,
strong
winds
from
Leslie
ripped
off
roofs
,
destroyed
trees
,
and
left
45,000
homes
without
power
.


Additionally
,
a
partially
built
house
was
destroyed
and
several
incomplete
homes
were
damaged
in
Pouch
Cove
.


Overall
,
Hurricane
Leslie
caused
$
10.1
million
(
2012
USD
)
in
damage
and
no
fatalities
.


the
landing
at
cape
helles
(
turkish
:
``

)
was
part
of
the
amphibious
invasion
of
the
gallipoli
peninsula
by
british
and
french
forces
on
25
april
1915
during
the
first
world
war
.


Helles
,
at
the
foot
of
the
peninsula
,
was
the
main
landing
area
.


With
the
support
of
the
guns
of
the
Royal
Navy
,
the
29th
Division
was
to
advance
along
the
peninsula
on
the
first
day
and
seize
the
heights
of
Achi
Baba
.


The
British
were
then
to
go
on
to
capture
the
forts
that
guarded
the
straits
of
the
Dardanelles
.


A
feigned
landing
at
Bulair
by
the
Royal
Naval
Division
and
a
real
landing
at
Anzac
Cove
were
made
to
the
north
at
Gaba
Tepe
,
by
the
Australian
and
New
Zealand
Army
Corps
before
dawn
and
a
diversionary
landing
was
made
by
French
forces
at
Kum
Kale
on
the
Asiatic
shore
of
the
Straits
.


After
dark
another
demonstration
was
made
by
the
French
in
Besika
Bay
.


The
Helles
landing
was
mismanaged
by
the
British
commander
,
Major
General
Aylmer
Hunter-Weston
.


V
and
W
beaches
became
bloodbaths
,
despite
the
meagre
defences
,
while
the
landings
at
other
sites
were
not
exploited
.


although
the
british
managed
to
gain
a
foothold
ashore
,
their
plans
were
in
disarray
.


For
two
months
the
British
fought
several
costly
battles
to
reach
the
first
day
objectives
but
were
defeated
by
the
Ottoman
army
.


Typhoon
Rammasun
,
known
in
the
Philippines
as
Typhoon
Glenda
,
was
one
of
the
only
two
Category
5
super
typhoons
on
record
in
the
South
China
Sea
,
with
the
other
one
being
Pamela
in
1954
.


Rammasun
had
destructive
impacts
across
the
Philippines
,
South
China
,
and
Vietnam
in
July
2014
.


Rammasun
is
a
Siamese
word
for
thunder
god
.


After
Lingling
and
Kajiki
earlier
in
2014
,
Rammasun
became
the
third
tropical
cyclone
,
and
first
typhoon
to
directly
impact
the
Philippines
in
2014
.


The
ninth
named
storm
and
the
third
typhoon
of
the
annual
typhoon
season
,
Rammasun
formed
in
the
Intertropical
Convergence
Zone
,
an
area
near
the
equator
where
the
northeast
and
southeast
trade
winds
come
together
,
and
slowly
drifted
northwest
.


Having
passed
through
the
islands
of
Micronesia
,
the
system
turned
west
and
quickly
moved
under
the
influence
of
a
subtropical
ridge
(
STR
)
.


Rammasun
posed
a
significant
threat
to
the
Philippine
island
of
Luzon
,
as
it
was
expected
to
reach
typhoon
intensity
before
making
landfall
there
.


though
initially
forecast
to
make
landfall
in
cagayan
valley
,
the
storm
followed
a
more
westerly
path
and
was
later
forecast
to
make
landfall
in
the
bicol
region
and
then
pass
through
bataan
and
zambales
before
brushing
past
metro
manila
.


In
preparation
for
the
storm
,
Governor
of
Guam
Eddie
Calvo
declared
the
island
in
Condition
of
Readiness
3
and
later
upgraded
it
to
Condition
of
Readiness
1
.


On
July
11
,
NASA
satellites
revealed
Rammasun
passing
directly
over
Guam
.


the
american
national
weather
service
stated
that
an
unexpected
rise
in
wind
shear
kept
the
system
from
intensifying
much
further
before
reaching
guam
.


Rammasun
only
made
landfall
on
Guam
as
a
tropical
depression
,
with
winds
much
weaker
than
earlier
anticipated
.


However
,
under
the
system
,
the
island
received
a
substantial
amount
of
rainfall
,
making
that
day
the
wettest
in
around
3
months
.


The
United
States
territory
received
25
to
50
mm
(
1
to
2
inches
)
of
rain
.


Along
with
the
Philippines
,
Taiwan
also
expected
impact
from
Rammasun
.


Moderate
to
heavy
rainfall
was
predicted
through
most
of
the
country
.


Chinese
meteorologists
were
focusing
on
second
and/or
third
landfalls
in
the
Chinese
Hainan
province
and
northern
Vietnam
.


Residents
of
Hong
Kong
were
also
warned
of
rainfall
and
subsequent
landslides
.


Following
the
closure
of
maritime
seaports
,
more
than
100
passengers
were
reportedly
stranded
at
the
Port
of
Batangas
,
along
with
39
rolling
cargoes
.


Meanwhile
,
at
least
841
passengers

A
total
50

over
100
thousand
families
were
evacuated
as
the
typhoon
neared
landfall
.


The
Philippine

said
that
they
have
prepared
all
government
hospitals
to
aid
the
rescue
and
relief
process
during
and
after
the
typhoon
.


They
claimed
that
they
are
much
better
prepared
now
,
than
they
were
for
earlier
typhoons
.


Ahead
of
the
landfall
,
a
city
in
the
province
of
Albay
had
declared
a
state
of
calamity
.

Various
parts
of
the
National

reported
power
outages
during
the
storm

They
were
reportedly
caused
by
``
a

grossed
$
188.6
million
in
2013
and

The
Chu–Han
Contention
(
206–202
BC
)
was
an
interregnum
between
the
Qin
dynasty
and
the
Han
dynasty
in
Chinese
history
.


Following
the
collapse
of
the
Qin
dynasty
in
206
BC
,
Xiang
Yu
split
the
former
Qin
Empire
into
the
Eighteen
Kingdoms
.


Two
major
contending
powers
emerged
,
Western
Chu
and
Han
,
which
engaged
in
a
struggle
for
supremacy
over
China
.


Western
Chu
was
led
by
Xiang
Yu
,
while
the
Han
leader
was
Liu
Bang
.


Several
minor
kings
also
warred
,
but
these
were
largely
independent
of
the
main
conflict
between
Western
Chu
and
Han
.


The
war
ended
in
202
BC
with
total
victory
for
Han
,
with
Liu
Bang
soon
proclaiming
himself
first
emperor
of
the
Han
dynasty
.


Hurricane
Charlie
was
the
deadliest
tropical
cyclone
of
the
1951
Atlantic
hurricane
season
.


The
third
named
storm
,
second
hurricane
,
and
second
major
hurricane
of
the
season
,
it
developed
from
a
tropical
wave
east
of
the
Lesser
Antilles
.


It
moved
briskly
west-northwest
,
passing
between
the
islands
of
Dominica
and
Guadeloupe
.


It
strengthened
to
a
hurricane
in
the
eastern
Caribbean
Sea
,
and
it
struck
Jamaica
with
winds
near
Category
3
intensity
.


It
strengthened
to
a
peak
intensity
of
135
mph
(
215
km/h
)
prior
to
landfall
on
Quintana
Roo
,
Yucatán
Peninsula
.


It
weakened
over
land
,
and
it
re-strengthened
over
the
Gulf
of
Mexico
before
it
made
a
final
landfall
near
Tampico
.


In
its
path
,
Charlie
caused
more
than
250
deaths
.


The
hurricane
produced
Jamaica
's
deadliest
natural
disaster
of
the
20th
century
,
causing
more
than
152
deaths
and
$
50,000,000
in
damages
.


The
hurricane
was
described
as
Tampico
's
worst
tropical
cyclone
since
1936
,
and
it
caused
more
than
100
fatalities
in
the
surrounding
areas
.


Many
bodies
were
not
recovered
after
flooding
.


The
hurricane
produced
peak
gusts
of
160
mph
(
260
km/h
)
at
the
airport
,
and
its
strongest
sustained
winds
were
unmeasured
in
mainland
Mexico
,
suggesting
that
it
may
have
been
a
Category
4
hurricane
at
landfall
.


The
Siege
of
Florence
took
place
from
24
October
1529
to
10
August
1530
,
at
the
end
of
the
War
of
the
League
of
Cognac
.


A
large
Imperial
and
Spanish
army
under
Philibert
of
Châlon
,
Prince
of
Orange
and
Pier
Maria
III
de
'
Rossi
surrounded
the
city
,
and
,
after
a
siege
of
nearly
ten
months
,
captured
it
,
overthrowing
the
Republic
of
Florence
and
installing
Alessandro
de
'
Medici
as
the
ruler
of
the
city
.


The
Florentines
had
thrown
off
Medici
rule
and
established
a
republic
after
the
Sack
of
Rome
in
1527
;
the
Florentine
Republic
had
continued
to
participate
in
the
war
on
the
side
of
the
French
.


the
french
defeats
at
naples
in
1528
and
unk
in
1529
,
however
,
led
to
francis
i
of
france
concluding
the
treaty
of
cambrai
with
the
holy
roman
emperor
charles
v.
when
pope
clement
vii
and
the
republic
of
venice
also
concluded
treaties
with
the
emperor
,
florence
was
left
to
fight
alone
.


Charles
,
attempting
to
gain
Clement
's
favor
,
ordered
his
armies
to
seize
Florence
and
return
the
Medici
to
power
.


The
Republic
resisted
this
incursion
;
but
,
left
without
allies
and
betrayed
by
many
of
the
mercenaries
in
her
employ
,
Florence
was
unable
to
keep
fighting
indefinitely
.


After
the
capture
of
Volterra
by
the
Imperial
forces
and
the
death
of
Francesco
Ferruccio
at
the
Battle
of
Gavinana
,
further
resistance
became
impractical
,
and
the
city
surrendered
in
August
1530
.


On
25
June
1994
,
the
22:45
from
Wemyss
Bay
to
Glasgow
,
in
Scotland
,
derailed
and
smashed
into
a
bridge
after
hitting
concrete
blocks
placed
deliberately
on
the
railway
by
vandals
outside
of
where
Drumfrochar
railway
station
would
be
opened
4
years
later
.


The
train
involved
was
a
refurbished
Class
303
Electric
Multiple
Unit
.


The
concrete
blocks
were
cable-trough
covers
,
which
were
placed
across
the
rails
of
the
single-track
line
by
two
vandals
who
had
climbed
down
to
the
railway
to
urinate
on
their
way
home
.


The
railway
at
this
point
is
on
a
curve
,
going
to
the
right
as
the
train
was
travelling
.


The
leading
bogie
of
the
EMU
derailed
and
the
train
immediately
collided
with
the
solid
structure
of
the
overbridge
,
crushing
the
driver
's
cab
,
killing
driver
Arthur
McKee
,
35
,
and
also
killing
passenger
Alan
Nicol
,
21
,
who
was
seated
immediately
behind
the
cab
,
with
his
back
to
the
partition
.


Alan
Nicol
had
taken
this
location
to
reduce
the
risk
of
injury
from
broken
glass
should
the
train
be
stoned
by
vandals
,
which
was
a
common
occurrence
in
that
area
.


Including
the
two
trainstaff
,
the
train
was
carrying
six
people
.


Following
the
tragedy
,
many
youths
in
the
surrounding
area
were
questioned
by
police
regarding
the
incident
.


After
a
trial
by
the
High
Court
,
Gary
Dougan
and
Craig
Houston
,
two
17-year-olds
from
Greenock
were
each
imprisoned
for
15
years
for
culpable
homicide
.


Dougan
and
Houston
launched
an
appeal
against
their
convictions
two
years
later
.


In
September
1996
,
the
Court
of
Appeal
in
Edinburgh
upheld
both
convictions
.


the
sabra
and
shatila
massacre
(
also
known
as
the
sabra
and
chatila
massacre
)
was
the
killing
of
between
460
and
3,500
civilians
,
mostly
palestinians
and
lebanese
shiites
,
by
a
militia
close
to
the
kataeb
party
,
also
called
phalange
,
a
predominantly
christian
lebanese
right-wing
party
in
the
sabra
neighborhood
and
the
adjacent
shatila
refugee
camp
in
beirut
,
lebanon
.


From
approximately
18:00
on
16
September
to
08:00
on
18
September
1982
,
a
widespread
massacre
was
carried
out
by
the
militia
under
the
eyes
of
their
Israeli
allies
.


The
Phalanges
,
allies
to
the
Israeli
Defence
Forces
(
IDF
)
,
were
ordered
by
the
IDF
to
clear
out
Palestine
Liberation
Organization
(
PLO
)
fighters
from
Sabra
and
Shatila
,
as
part
of
the
IDF
maneuvering
into
West
Beirut
.


The
IDF
received
reports
of
some
of
the
Phalanges
atrocities
in
Sabra
and
Shatila
but
failed
to
take
any
action
to
prevent
or
stop
the
massacre
.


the
massacre
was
presented
as
retaliation
for
the
assassination
of
newly
elected
lebanese
president
bachir
gemayel
,
the
leader
of
the
lebanese
kataeb
party
.


It
was
wrongly
assumed
by
the
Phalangists
that
Palestinian
militants
had
carried
out
the
assassination
.


in
june
1982
,
the
israel
defense
forces
had
invaded
lebanon
with
the
intention
of
rooting
out
the
plo
.


by
mid-1982
,
under
the
supervision
of
the
multinational
force
,
the
plo
withdrew
from
lebanon
following
weeks
of
battles
in
west
beirut
and
shortly
before
the
massacre
took
place
.


Various
forces
—
Israeli
,
Phalangists
and
possibly
also
the
South
Lebanon
Army
(
SLA
)
—
were
in
the
vicinity
of
Sabra
and
Shatila
at
the
time
of
the
slaughter
,
taking
advantage
of
the
fact
that
the
Multinational
Force
had
removed
barracks
and
mines
that
had
encircled
Beirut
's
predominantly
Muslim
neighborhoods
and
kept
the
Israelis
at
bay
during
the
Beirut
siege
.


The
Israeli
advance
over
West
Beirut
in
the
wake
of
the
PLO
withdrawal
,
which
enabled
the
Phalangist
raid
,
was
considered
a
violation
of
the
ceasefire
agreement
between
the
various
forces
.


The
Israeli
Army
surrounded
Sabra
and
Shatila
and
stationed
troops
at
the
exits
of
the
area
to
prevent
camp
residents
from
leaving
and
,
at
the
Phalangists
'
request
,
fired
illuminating
flares
at
night
.


According
to
Alain
Menargues
,
the
direct
perpetrators
of
the
killings
were
the
``
Young
Men
''
,
a
gang
recruited
by
Elie
Hobeika
,
a
prominent
figure
in
the
Phalanges
,
the
Lebanese
Forces
intelligence
chief
and
liaison
officer
with
Mossad
,
from
men
who
had
been
expelled
from
the
Lebanese
Forces
for
insubordination
or
criminal
activities
.


The
killings
are
widely
believed
to
have
taken
place
under
Hobeika
's
direct
orders
.


Hobeika
's
family
and
fiancée
had
been
murdered
by
Palestinian
militiamen
,
and
their
Lebanese
allies
,
at
the
Damour
massacre
of
1976
,
itself
a
response
to
the
1976
Karantina
massacre
of
Palestinians
and
Lebanese
Muslims
at
the
hands
of
Christian
militants
.


Hobeika
later
became
a
long-serving
Member
of
the
Parliament
of
Lebanon
and
served
in
several
ministerial
roles
.


Other
Phalangist
commanders
involved
were
Joseph
Edde
from
South
Lebanon
,
Dib
Anasta
,
head
of
the
Phalangist
Military
Police
,
Michael
Zouein
,
and
Maroun
Mischalani
from
East
Beirut
.


In
all
300–400
militiamen
were
involved
,
including
some
from
Sa'ad
Haddad
's
South
Lebanon
Army
.


in
1983
,
a
commission
chaired
by
UNK
macbride
,
the
assistant
to
the
un
secretary
general
and
president
of
united
nations
general
assembly
at
the
time
,
concluded
that
israel
,
as
the
camp
's
occupying
power
,
bore
responsibility
for
the
violence
.


The
commission
also
concluded
that
the
massacre
was
a
form
of
genocide
.


in
1983
,
the
israeli
kahan
commission
,
appointed
to
investigate
the
incident
,
found
that
israeli
military
personnel
,
aware
that
a
massacre
was
in
progress
,
had
failed
to
take
serious
steps
to
stop
it
.


the
commission
deemed
israel
indirectly
responsible
,
and
ariel
sharon
,
then
defense
minister
,
bore
personal
responsibility
``
for
ignoring
the
danger
of
bloodshed
and
revenge
''
,
forcing
him
to
resign
.


The
1587
siege
of
Kagoshima
took
place
during
Japan
's
Sengoku
period
,
and
was
the
last
stand
of
the
Shimazu
family
against
the
forces
of
Toyotomi
Hideyoshi
.


This
was
the
final
battle
in
Hideyoshi
's
campaign
to
take
Kyūshū
.


Following
the
Shimazu
defeat
at
Sendaigawa
,
the
Shimazu
then
retreated
to
their
home
castle
of
Kagoshima
.


Hideyoshi
's
forces
numbering
roughly
60,000
,
then
made
a
landing
,
having
set
off
from
Akune
.


Under
the
leadership
of
Hashiba
Hidenaga
,
Fukushima
Masanori
,
Katō
Kiyomasa
and
Kuroda
Yoshitaka
,
they
then
surrounded
the
city
.


The
land-based
divisions
,
which
were
not
on
the
boats
from
Akune
,
had
traversed
the
volcanic
valleys
defending
the
city
with
the
help
of
local
monks
.


In
the
end
,
however
,
negotiation
precluded
any
fighting
.


The
7
July
2005
London
bombings
,
often
referred
to
as
7/7
,
were
a
series
of
coordinated
Islamist
terrorist
suicide
attacks
in
London
,
England
,
that
targeted
commuters
travelling
on
the
city
's
public
transport
system
during
the
morning
rush
hour
.


Four
radical
Islamic
terrorists
separately
detonated
three
homemade
bombs
in
quick
succession
aboard
London
Underground
trains
across
the
city
and
,
later
,
a
fourth
on
a
double-decker
bus
in
Tavistock
Square
.


The
train
bombings
occurred
on
the
Circle
line
near
and
at
Edgware
Road
,
and
on
the
Piccadilly
line
near
.


52
people
of
18
different
nationalities
,
all
of
whom
were
UK
residents
,
were
killed
,
and
more
than
700
were
injured
in
the
attacks
,
making
it
Britain
's
deadliest
terrorist
incident
since
the
1988
bombing
of
Pan
Am
Flight
103
near
Lockerbie
,
Scotland
,
and
England
's
deadliest
since
the
1974
Birmingham
pub
bombings
,
as
well
as
the
country
's
first
Islamist
suicide
attack
.


The
explosions
were
caused
by
triacetone
triperoxide
IEDs
packed
into
backpacks
.


The
bombings
were
followed
two
weeks
later
by
a
series
of
attempted
attacks
that
failed
to
cause
injury
or

The
``
Struma
''
disaster
was
the
sinking
on
24
February
1942
of
a
ship
,
,
that
had
been
trying
to
take
nearly
800
Jewish
refugees
from
Axis-allied
Romania
to
Mandatory
Palestine
.


She
was
a
small
iron-hulled
ship
of
only
that
had
been
built
in
1867
as
a
steam-powered
schooner
but
had
recently
been
re-engined
with
an
unreliable
second-hand
diesel
engine
.


``
Struma
''
was
only
long
,
had
a
beam
of
only
and
a
draught
of
only
but
an
estimated
791
refugees
and
10
crew
were
crammed
into
her
.


``
Struma
''
s
diesel
engine
failed
several
times
between
her
departure
from
Constanţa
on
the
Black
Sea
on
12
December
1941
and
her
arrival
in
Istanbul
on
15
December
.


She
had
to
be
towed
by
a
tug
boat
to
leave
Constanţa
and
to
enter
Istanbul
.


On
23
February
1942
,
with
her
engine
still
inoperable
and
her
refugee
passengers
aboard
,
Turkish
authorities
towed
``
Struma
''
from
Istanbul
through
the
Bosphorus
out
to
the
coast

refugees
plus
10
crew
,
making
it
the
Black
Sea
's
largest
exclusively
civilian
naval
disaster
of
World
War
II
.


Until
recently
the
number
of
victims
had
been
estimated
at
768
,
but
the
current
figure
is
the
result
of
a
recent
study
of
six
different
passenger
lists
.


Only
one
person
aboard
,
19-year-old
David
Stoliar
,

(
he
died

Typhoon
Fanapi
,
known
in
the
Philippines
as
Typhoon
Inday
,
was
a
damaging
and
deadly
typhoon
that
struck
Taiwan
and
southeastern
China
in
September
2010
.


It
was
the
eleventh
tropical
storm
and
fourth
typhoon
of
the
annual
season
.


The
storm
formed
on
September
14
east
of
the
Philippines
and
moved
slowly
for
several
days
,
initially
to
the
northwest
,
then
curving
to
the
northeast
before
turning
westward
due
to
a
ridge
to
the
north
.


During
this
time
,
Fanapi
intensified
to
reach
10
minute
maximum
sustained
winds
of
175
km/h
(
110
mph
)
.


Fanapi
made
its
first
landfall
on
September
19
over
Hualien
,
Taiwan
,
becoming
the
first
typhoon
to
hit
the
island
since
Typhoon
Morakot
in
August
2009
.


Later
that
day
made
a
final
landfall
in
Fujian
,
China
.


The
storm
dissipated
on
September
21
over
southern
China
.


The
typhoon
first
affected
southern
Japan
,
bringing
rainfall
to
the
outer
Miyako
Islands
.


However
,
impacts
were
worst
in
Taiwan
and
mainland
China
.


In
southern
Taiwan
,
Fanapi
dropped
heavy
rainfall
,
peaking
at
1,126
mm
(
44
in
)
in
Majia
,
Pingtung
.


About
150,000
people
evacuated
their
homes
,
and
there
were
heightened
preparations
after
the
damaging
effects
of
Typhoon
Morakot
the
previous
year
.


The
heavy
rainfall
from
Fanapi
caused
landslides
,
heavy
crop
damage
,
and
flooding
,
notably
in
the
major
city
of
Kaohsiung
,
where
rains
totaled
.


In
some
areas
of
the
city
,
the
floods
reached
over
one-story
deep
,
inundating
cars
and
causing
about
NT
$
3
billion
(
New
Taiwan
dollar
,
US
$
93.75
million
)
in
industrial
damage
.


There
were
five
deaths
in
Taiwan
during
the
storm
's
passage
,
and
damage
was
estimated
at
NT
$
5
billion
(
US
$
158
million
)
.


Later
,
the
threat
from
Fanapi
caused
264,000
people
to
evacuate
their
homes
in
southeastern
China
.


The
storm
dropped
heavy
rainfall
in
the
region
,
reaching
in
Guangdong
.


Fanapi
also
caused
landslides
there
,
killing
100
people
,
including
28
in
Xinyi
due
to
a
collapse
at
a
mine
.


Also
in
Guangdong
,
the
storm
wrecked
16,000
homes
and
flooded
of
crop
fields
.


Provincial
damage
was
estimated
at
¥5.15
billion
(
CNY
,
$
757.05
million
)
.


The
name
Fanapi
was
later
retired
due
to
the
heavy
damage
.

,
and
almost
obliterated
the
Peruvian
army
defending
it
.


at
the
end
of
the

in
order
that
the
Chilean
army
could
enter
the
Peruvian
capital
city
at
Miraflores
,
two
days
later

Panhandle
.


Turning
northeast
,
it
crossed
Georgia
and
South
Carolina
,
and
entered
the

match
was
played
at
Wembley
Stadium
on
15
March
1980
,
and
was
contested
by
League
Cup
holders
and
European
champions
Nottingham
Forest
and
Wolverhampton
Wanderers
.


Wolves
won
the
match
1–0
thanks
to
an
Andy
Gray
goal
in
the
67th
minute
.


As
both
League
Cup
and
European
Cup
holders
,
Nottingham
Forest
had
entered
the
match
as
clear
favourites
.


Indeed
,
victory
here
would
have
given
the
club
a
hat
trick
of
League
Cup
wins
,
and
they
retained
the
European
Cup
at
the
end
of
the
season
.


By
contrast
,
Wolves
'
last
silverware
had
been
their
League
Cup
win
six
years
earlier
and
they
had
finished
a
lowly
18th
in
the
First
Division
in
the
previous
campaign
,
whilst
Forest
had
ended
runners-up

The
1975
Pacific
Northwest
hurricane
was
an
unusual
Pacific
tropical
cyclone
that
attained
hurricane
status
farther
north
than
any
other
Pacific
hurricane
.


It
was
officially
unnamed
,
with
the
cargo
ship
providing
vital
meteorological
data
in
assessing
the
storm
.


The
twelfth
tropical
cyclone
of
the
1975
Pacific
hurricane
season
,
it
developed
from
a
cold-core
upper-level
low
merging
with
the
remnants
of
a
tropical
cyclone
on
August
31
,
well
to
the
northeast
of
Hawaii
.


Convection
increased
as
the
circulation
became
better
defined
,
and
by
early
on
September
2
it
became
a
tropical
storm
.


Turning
to
the
northeast
through
an
area
of
warm
water
temperatures
,
the
storm
quickly
strengthened
,
and
,
after
developing
an
eye
,
it
attained
hurricane
status
late
on
September
3
,
while
located
about
1,200
miles
(
1,950
km
)
south
of
Alaska
.


After
maintaining
peak
winds
for
about
18
hours
,
the
storm
rapidly
weakened
,
as
it
interacted
with
an
approaching
cold
front
.


Early
on
September
5
,
it
lost
its
identity
near
the
coast
of

than
the

and
a
half
out
of
ten
given
to
the
2007
event
's
ranking
by
Chris
Sokol
.


In
October
2017
,
with
the
launch
of
the
Global
Wrestling
Network
,
the
event
became
available
to
stream
on
demand
.


British
European
Airways
Flight
548
was
a
scheduled
passenger
flight
from
London
Heathrow
to
Brussels
that
crashed
near
the
town
of
Staines
,
England
,
soon
after
take-off
on
18
June
1972
,
killing
all
118
people
on
board
.


The
accident
became
known
as
the
Staines
air
disaster
and
,
,
remains
the
deadliest
air
accident
(
as
opposed
to
terrorist
incidents
)
in
the
United
Kingdom
.


It
marks
the
highest
death
toll
involving
a
Hawker
Siddeley
Trident
.


The
aircraft
suffered
a
deep
stall
in
the
third
minute
of
its
flight
and
crashed
to
the
ground
,
narrowly
missing
a
busy
main
road
.


The
inquest
principally
blamed
the
captain
for
failing
to
maintain
airspeed
and
configure
the
high-lift
devices
correctly
.


It
also
cited
the
captain
's
heart
condition
and
the
limited
experience
of
the
co-pilot
,
while
noting
an
unspecified
``
technical
problem
''
that
the
crew
apparently
resolved
before
take-off
.


The
crash
took
place
against
the
background
of
a
pilots
'
strike
that
had
caused
bad
feelings
between
crew
members
.


The
strike
had
also
disrupted
services
,
causing
Flight
548
to
be
loaded
with
the
maximum
weight
allowable
.


Recommendations
from
the
inquiry
led
to
the
mandatory
installation
of
cockpit
voice
recorders
in
British-registered
airliners
.


Another
recommendation
was
for
greater
caution
before
allowing
off-duty
crew
members
to
occupy
flight
deck
seats
.


Some
observers
felt
that
the
inquiry
was
unduly
biased
in
favour
of
the
aircraft
's
manufacturers
.

ura
)
,
following
a
bloody
purge
that

14
members

dead
,
broke
into
a

a
hostage
.


A
standoff
between
police

The
lodge
was
a
natural
fortress

solidly
constructed
of
thick
concrete
on
a
steep
hillside
with
only
one
entrance
,
which
,
along
with

pay-per-view
buys
,
an
increase
on
the
figure
earned
by
the
2009

Despite
the
increased
number
of

,
the
event
received
generally
negative
reviews

Herzegovina
(
ARBiH
)
from
the
Srebrenica
enclave
on
Orthodox
Christmas
Day
,
7
January
1993
.


During
the
Bosnian
War
,
the
Srebrenica
enclave
was
besieged
by
the
Serb
forces
who
rarely
allowed
humanitarian
aid
to
enter
the
area
,
creating
hunger
and
lack
of
medicine
among
the
Srebrenica
inhabitants
.


It
is
alleged
that
the
ARBiH
attacked
,
among
other
objectives
,
in
order
to
find
food
,
but
also
to
acquire
weapons
,
ammunition
and
military
equipment
.


The
attack
was
organized
to
coincide
with
the
Serbian
Orthodox
Christmas
,
leaving
the
Serbs
unprepared
for
any
attack
.


49
people
died
in
the
attack
on
the
Serb
side
:
35
VRS
soldiers
and
11
civilians
.


There
was
one
survivor
,
who
happened
to
be
in
his
water
main
hole
.


The
event
is
still
marked
by
controversy
.


Republika
Srpska
claimed
that
all
the
homes
were
systematically
torched
by
Bosniak
armed
group
,
but
this
could
not
be
independently
verified
during
the
trial
of
Naser
Orić
by
the
ICTY
,
where
the
judges
concluded
that
many
houses
were
already
previously
destroyed
during
the
war
.


The
civilian
casualties
in
the
village
led
to
allegations
by
Serbia
that
Bosniak
forces
had
carried
out
a
massacre
.


Orić
was
acquitted
of
the
charges
relating
to
the
killings
,
and
later
acquitted
of
all
charges
on
appeal
.

Airport
,
Japan
.


on
august

,
1985
,
a
boeing
unk
operating
this
route
suffered
a
sudden
decompression
twelve
minutes
into
the
flight
and
crashed
in
the
area
of
mount

,
ueno
,
gunma
prefecture
,
from

thirty-two
minutes
later
.


the
crash
site
was
on
unk
ridge
,
near
mount
unk
.


japan
's
aircraft
accident
investigation
commission
officially
concluded
that
the
rapid
decompression
was
caused
by
a
faulty
repair
by
boeing
technicians
after
a
unk
incident
during
a
landing
at
osaka
airport
seven
years
earlier
in
1978
.


A
doubler
plate
on
the
rear
bulkhead
of
the
plane
had
been
improperly
repaired
,
compromising
the
plane
's
airworthiness
.


Cabin
pressurization
continued
to
expand
and
contract
the
improperly
repaired
bulkhead
until
the
day
of
the
accident
,
when
the
faulty
repair
finally
failed
,
causing
the
rapid
decompression
that
ripped
off
a
large
portion
of
the
tail
and
caused
the
loss
of
hydraulic
controls
to
the
entire
plane
.


The
aircraft
,
configured
with
increased
economy
class
seating
,
was
carrying
524
people
.


Casualties
of
the
crash
included
all
15
crew
members
and
505
of
the
509
passengers
.


some
passengers
survived
the
initial
crash
but
subsequently
died
of
their
injuries
hours
later
,
mostly
due
to
the
japan
self-defense
forces
'
decision
to
wait
until
the
next
day
to
go
to
the
crash
site
,
after
declining
an
offer
from
a
nearby
united
states
air
force
base
to
start
an
immediate
rescue
operation
.


It
is
the
deadliest
single-aircraft
accident
in
aviation
history
.


operation
scorch
sword
(
)
was
a
surprise
airstrike
carried
out
by
islamic
republic
of
iran
air
force
(
iriaf
)
on
30
september
1980
,
that
damaged
an
unk
nuclear
reactor
17
km
south-east
of
baghdad
,
iraq
.


Eight
days
into
the
Iran–Iraq
War
,
Operation
Scorch
Sword
commenced
.


at
dawn
on
30
september
1980
,
four
iranian
f-4e
phantom
jets
refueled
mid-air
near
the
iran-iraq
border
.


After
crossing
into
Iraq
,
the
fighters
climbed
to
a
higher
altitude
to
be
undetectable
by
Iraqi
radar
.


Moments
later
,
two
of
the
Phantoms
peeled
off
,
and
dropped
to
a
lower
altitude
again
to
avoid
radar
detection
.


They
flew
stealthily
to
Tuwaitha
,
a
city
ten
miles
(
17.58
km
)
southeast
of
Baghdad
,
home
to
the
``
Osirak
''
nuclear
reactor
.


This
was
the
first
attack
on
a
nuclear
reactor
and
only
the
third
on
a
nuclear
facility
in
history
.


It
was
also
the
first
instance
of
a
preventive
attack
on
a
nuclear
reactor
,
the
intent
of
which
was
to
forestall
the
development
of
a
nuclear
weapon
.


the
reactor
was
completely
destroyed
in
another
airstrike
about
eight
months
later
on
7
june
1981
by
the
israeli
air
force
,
in
an
operation
called
operation
opera
.


On
16
July
1983
a
British
Airways
Helicopters
commercial
Sikorsky
S-61
helicopter
,
``
Oscar
November
''
(
G-BEON
)
,
crashed
in
the
southern
Celtic
Sea
,
in
the
Atlantic
Ocean
,
when
en
route
from
Penzance
to
St
Mary
's
,
Isles
of
Scilly
in
poor
visibility
.


Only
six
of
the
twenty-six
people
on
board
survived
.


It
was
Britain
's
worst
helicopter
civil
aviation
accident
at
the
time
.


An
investigation
was
promptly
carried
out
by
the
Accidents
Investigation
Branch
(
AIB
)
,
though
calls
for
a
public
inquiry
were
dismissed
.


The
AIB
found
that
the
accident
was
caused
by
pilot
error
,
in
failing
to
notice
and
correct
an
unintentional
descent
when
attempting
to
fly
at
low
altitude
due
to
poor
visibility
.


Other
contributory
factors
were
found
to
be
a
failure
to
monitor
flight
instruments
adequately
,
and
a
lack
of
audio
height
warning
equipment
.


The
crash
sparked
a
review
of
helicopter
safety
,
and
eight
recommendations
were
made
by
the
AIB
.


Of
these
,
seven
were
adopted
,
most
notably
that
it
was
mandatory
for
there
to
be
audible
height
warnings
on
passenger
helicopters
operating
off-shore
.


It
remained
the
worst
British
civilian
helicopter
accident
until
1986
,
when
the
Boeing
234LR
Chinook
helicopter
G-BWFC
crashed
in
the
North
Sea
,
with
45
fatalities
.


The
voyage
of
the
``
Glorioso
''
involved
four
naval
engagements
fought
in
1747
during
the
War
of
the
Austrian
Succession
between
the
Spanish
70-gun
ship
of
the
line
``
Glorioso
''
and
several
British
squadrons
of
ships
of
the
line
and
frigates
which
tried
to
capture
it
.


the
``
glorioso
''
,
carrying
four
million
silver
dollars
from
the
americas
,
was
able
to
repel
two
british
attacks
off
the
azores
and
cape
finisterre
,
successfully
landing
her
cargo
at
the
port
of
unk
,
spain
.


several
days
after
unloading
the
cargo
,
while
sailing
to
cadiz
for
repairs
,
``
glorioso
''
was
attacked
successively
near
cape
st
vincent
by
four
british
privateer
frigates
and
the
ships
of
the
line
hms
``
dartmouth
''
and
hms
``
russell
''
from
admiral
john
byng
's
fleet
.


The
``
Dartmouth
''
blew
up
killing
most
of
her
crew
,
but
the
92-gun
``
Russell
''
eventually
forced
the
``
Glorioso
''
to
strike
the
colours
.


The
British
took
her
to
Lisbon
,
where
she
had
to
be
broken
up
because
of
the
extensive
damage
suffered
during
the
last
battle
.


The
commander
of
the
ship
,
Pedro
Messia
de
la
Cerda
,
and
his
men
,
were
taken
to
Great
Britain
as
prisoners
,
but
were
considered
heroes
in
Spain
and
gained
the
admiration
of
their
enemies
.


Several
British
officers
were
court-martialed
and
expelled
from
the
Navy
for
their
poor
performance
against
the
enemy
.

According
to

intelligence
sources
,
the
attack
was
far
more
dangerous
than
the
2009
Pakistan
Army
General
Headquarters
attack
,
and
was
better
planned
and
more
rehearsed
than
the
previous
attack
.


It
was
the
biggest
attack
on
the
Navy
and
its
assets
since
1971
,
and
is
believed
to
be
the
last
major

The
Northern
Mali
Conflict
,
Mali
Civil
War
,
or
Mali
War
refers
to
armed
conflicts
that
started
from
January
2012
between
the
northern
and
southern
parts
of
Mali
in
Africa
.


On
16
January
2012
,
several
insurgent
groups
began
fighting
a
campaign
against
the
Malian
government
for
independence
or
greater
autonomy
for
northern
Mali
,
an
area
of
northern
Mali
they
called
Azawad
.


The
National
Movement
for
the
Liberation
of
Azawad
(
MNLA
)
,
an
organization
fighting
to
make
this
area
of
Mali
an
independent
homeland
for
the
Tuareg
people
,
had
taken
control
of
the
region
by
April
2012
.


On
22
March
2012
,
President
Amadou
Toumani
Touré
was
ousted
in
a
coup
d'état
over
his
handling
of
the
crisis
,
a
month
before
a
presidential
election
was
to
have
taken
place
.


Mutinous
soldiers
,
calling
themselves
the
National
Committee
for
the
Restoration
of
Democracy
and
State
(
CNRDR
)
,
took
control
and
suspended
the
constitution
of
Mali
.


As
a
consequence
of
the
instability
following
the
coup
,
Mali
's
three
largest
northern
cities—Kidal
,
Gao
and
Timbuktu—were
overrun
by
the
rebels
on
three
consecutive
days
.


On
5
April
2012
,
after
the
capture
of
Douentza
,
the
MNLA
said
that
it
had
accomplished
its
goals
and
called
off
its
offensive
.


The
following
day
,
it
proclaimed
the
independence
of
northern
Mali
from
the
rest
of
the
country
,
renaming
it
Azawad
.


The
MNLA
were
initially
backed
by
the
Islamist
group
Ansar
Dine
.


After
the
Malian
military
was
driven
from
northern
Mali
,
Ansar
Dine
and
a
number
of
smaller
Islamist
groups
began
imposing
strict
Sharia
law
.


The
MNLA
and
Islamists
struggled
to
reconcile
their
conflicting
visions
for
an
intended
new
state
.


Afterwards
,
the
MNLA
began
fighting
against
Ansar
Dine
and
other
Islamist
groups
,
including
Movement
for
Oneness
and
Jihad
in
West
Africa
(
MOJWA/MUJAO
)
,
a
splinter
group
of
Al-Qaeda
in
the
Islamic
Maghreb
.


By
17
July
2012
,
the
MNLA
had
lost
control
of
most
of
northern
Mali
's
cities
to
the
Islamists
.


The
government
of
Mali
asked
for
foreign
military
help
to
re-take
the
north
.


On
11
January
2013
,
the
French
military
began
operations
against
the
Islamists
.


Forces
from
other
African
Union
states
were
deployed
shortly
after
.


By
8
February
,
the
Islamist-held
territory
had
been
re-taken
by
the
Malian
military
,
with
help
from
the
international
coalition
.


Tuareg
separatists
have
continued
to
fight
the
Islamists
as
well
,
although
the
MNLA
has
also
been
accused
of
carrying
out
attacks
against
the
Malian
military
.


A
peace
deal
between
the
government
and
Tuareg
rebels
was
signed
on
18
June
2013
,
however
on
26
September
2013
the
rebels
pulled
out
of
the
peace
agreement
and
claimed
that
the
government
had
not
respected
its
commitments
to
the
truce
.


Fighting
is
still
ongoing
even
though
French
forces
are
scheduled
for
withdrawal
.


A
ceasefire
agreement
was
signed
on
19
February
2015
in
Algiers
,
Algeria
,
but
sporadic
terrorist
attacks
still
occur
.


Despite
the
signing
of
a
peace
accord
in
the
capital
on
15
April
2015
,
low-level
fighting
continues
.


the
unk
unk
standoff
was
a
military
standoff
between
india
and
pakistan
that
resulted
in
the
massing
of
troops
on
either
side
of
the
border
and
along
the
line
of
control
(
loc
)
in
the
region
of
kashmir
.


This
was
the
second
major
military
standoff
between
India
and
Pakistan
following
the
successful
detonation
of
nuclear
devices
by
both
countries
in
1998
,
with
the
first
being
the
Kargil
War
of
1999
.


the
military
buildup
was
initiated
by
india
responding
to
a
terrorist
attack
on
the
indian
parliament
on
13
december
2001
(
during
which
twelve
people
,
including
the
five
terrorists
who
attacked
the
building
,
were
killed
)
and
the
jammu
and
kashmir
legislative
assembly
on
1
october
2001
.


India
claimed
that
the
attacks
were
carried
out
by
two
Pakistan-based
terror
groups
fighting
Indian
administered
Kashmir
,
the
Lashkar-e-Taiba
and
Jaish-e-Mohammad
,
both
of
whom
India
has
said
are
backed
by
Pakistan
's
ISI–a
charge
that
Pakistan
denied
.


in
western
media
,
coverage
of
the
standoff
focused
on
the
possibility
of
a
nuclear
war
between
the
two
countries
and
the
implications
of
the
potential
conflict
on
the
american-led
``
global
war
on
terrorism
''
in
nearby
afghanistan
.


Tensions
de-escalated
following
international
diplomatic
mediation
which
resulted
in
the
October
2002
withdrawal
of
Indian
and
Pakistani
troops
from
the
international
border
.


The
2010
Africa
Cup
of
Nations
,
also
known
as
the
Orange
Africa
Cup
of
Nations
for
sponsorship
reasons
,
was
the
27th
Africa
Cup
of
Nations
,
the
biennial
football
championship
of
Africa
(
CAF
)
.


It
was
held
in
Angola
,
where
it
began
on
10
January
2010
and
concluded
on
31
January
.


In
the
tournament
,
the
hosts
Angola
were
to
be
joined
by
15
nations
who
advanced
from
the
qualification
process
that
began
in
October
2007
and
involved
53
African
national
teams
.


The
withdrawal
of
Togo
after
a
terrorist
attack
on
their
bus
upon
arriving
for
the
tournament
reduced
the
number
of
participating
nations
to
15
.


A
total
of
29
games
were
played
,
instead
of
the
scheduled
32
games
.


Egypt
won
the
tournament
,
their
seventh
ACN
title
and
an
unprecedented
third
in
a
row
,
beating
Ghana
1–0
in
the
final
.


The
2015
Baga
massacre
was
a
series
of
mass
killings
carried
out
by
the
Boko
Haram
terrorist
group
in
the
north-eastern
Nigerian
town
of
Baga
and
its
environs
,
in
the
state
of
Borno
,
between
3
January
and
7
January
2015
.


the
attack
began
on
3
january
when
boko
haram
overran
a
military
base
that
was
the
headquarters
of
the
multinational
joint
task
force
containing
troops
from
chad
,
niger
,
and
nigeria
.


The
militants
then
forced
thousands
of
locals
from
the
region
and
committed
mass
killings
that
culminated
on
the
7th
.


Fatalities
have
been
reported
to
be
``
heavy
''
but
their
extent
is
unclear
.


Western
media
outlets
reported
that
``
over
2,000
''
people
are
thought
to
have
been
killed
or
``
unaccounted
for
''
,
but
local
media
reported
``
at
least
a
hundred
''
fatalities
,
while
the
Nigerian
Ministry
of
Defence
said
that
no
more
than
150
people
in
total
had
been
killed
,
including
militants
.


Several
government
officials
denied
that
the
fatalities
were
as
extensive
as
reported
,
with
some
even
claiming
that
the
massacre
had
never
taken
place
or
that
the
Nigerian
military
had
repelled
the
militants
from
the
region
,
a
claim
that
was
refuted
by
local
officials
,
survivors
,
and
the
international
media
.


Baga
and
at
least
16
other
towns
are
thought
to
have
been
destroyed
as
over
35,000
people
are
reported
to
have
been
displaced
,

,
the

since
the

The
military
established
a
junta
called
the
National
Council
for
Peace
and
Order
(
NCPO
)
to
govern
the
nation
.


After
dissolving
the
government
and
the
Senate
,
the
NCPO
vested
executive
and
legislative
powers
in
its
leader
and
ordered
the
judicial
branch
to
operate
under
its
directives
.


In
addition
,
it
partially
repealed
the
2007
constitution
,
save
the
second
chapter
which
concerns
the
king
,
declared
martial
law
and
curfew
nationwide
,
banned
political
gatherings
,
arrested
and
detained
politicians
and
anti-coup
activists
,
imposed
Internet
censorship
and
took
control
of
the
media
.


The
NCPO
issued
an
interim
constitution
granting
itself
amnesty
and
sweeping
power
.


The
NCPO
also
established
a
military
dominated
national
legislature
which
later
unanimously
elected
General
Prayut
as
the
new
prime
minister
of
the
country
.


The
Demerara
rebellion
of
1823
was
an
uprising
involving
more
than
10,000
slaves
that
took
place
in
the
colony
of
Demerara-Essequibo
(
Guyana
)
.


The
rebellion
,
which
took
place
on
18
August
1823
and
lasted
for
two
days
,
was
led
by
slaves
with
the
highest
status
.


In
part
they
were
reacting
to
poor
treatment
and
a
desire
for
freedom
;
in
addition
,
there
was
a
widespread
,
mistaken
belief
that
Parliament
had
passed
a
law
for
emancipation
,
but
it
was
being
withheld
by
the
colonial
rulers
.


Instigated
chiefly
by
Jack
Gladstone
,
a
slave
at
``
Success
''
plantation
,
the
rebellion
also
involved
his
father
,
Quamina
,
and
other
senior
members
of
their
church
group
.


Its
English
pastor
,
John
Smith
,
was
implicated
.


The
largely
non-violent
rebellion
was
brutally
crushed
by
the
colonists
under
governor
John
Murray
.


They
killed
many
slaves
:
estimates
of
the
toll
from
fighting
range
from
100
to
250
.


After
the
insurrection
was
put
down
,
the
government
sentenced
another
45
men
to
death
,
and
27
were
executed
.


The
executed
slaves
'
bodies
were
displayed
in
public
for
months
afterwards
as
a
deterrent
to
others
.


Jack
was
deported
to
the
island
of
Saint
Lucia
after
the
rebellion
following
a
clemency
plea
by
Sir
John
Gladstone
,
the
owner
of
``
Success
''
plantation
.


John
Smith
,
who
had
been
court-martialed
and
was
awaiting
news
of
his
appeal
against
a
death
sentence
,
died
a
martyr
for
the
abolitionist
cause
.


News
of
Smith
's
death
strengthened
the
abolitionist
movement
in
Britain
.


Quamina
,
who
is
thought
to
have
been
the
actual
leader
of
the
rebellion
,
was
declared
a
national
hero
after
Guyana
's
independence
.


Streets
and
monuments
have
been
dedicated
to
him
in
the
capital
of
Georgetown
,
Guyana
.


The
Franklin
Dam
or
Gordon-below-Franklin
Dam
project
was
a
proposed
dam
on
the
Gordon
River
in
Tasmania
,
Australia
,
that
was
never
constructed
.


The
movement
that
eventually
led
to
the
project
's
cancellation
became
one
of
the
most
significant
environmental
campaigns
in
Australian
history
.


The
dam
was
proposed
for
the
purpose
of
generating
hydroelectricity
.


The
resulting
new
electricity
generation
capacity
would
have
been
.


The
proposed
construction
would
have
subsequently
impacted
upon
the
environmentally
sensitive
Franklin
River
,
which
joins
the
Gordon
nearby
.


During
the
campaign
against
the
dam
,
both
areas
were
listed
on
the
UNESCO
World
Heritage
Area
register
.


The
campaign
that
followed
led
to
the
consolidation
of
the
small
green
movement
that
had
been
born
out
of
the
non-violent
protest
campaign
against
the
building
of
three
dams
on
Lake
Pedder
in
the
late
1960s
and
early
1970s
.


over
the
five
years
between
the
announcement
of
the
dam
proposal
in
1978
and
the
axing
of
the
plans
in
1983
,
there
was
vigorous
debate
between
the
pro-
and
unk
lobbies
,
with
large
protests
from
both
sides
.


In
December
1982
,
the
dam
site
was
occupied
by
protesters
,
leading
to
widespread
arrests
and
greater
publicity
.


The
dispute
became
a
federal
issue
the
following
March
,
when
a
campaign
in
the
national
print
media
,
assisted
by
the
pictures
of
photographer
Peter
Dombrovskis
,
helped
bring
down
the
government
of
Malcolm
Fraser
at
the
1983
election
.


the
new
government
,
under
bob
hawke
,
had
promised
to
stop
the
dam
from
being
built
.


A
legal
battle
between
the
federal
government
and
Tasmanian
Government
followed
,
resulting
in
a
landmark
High
Court
ruling
in
the
federal
government
's
favour

The
Bosnian
War
(
Serbo-Croatian
:
``
Rat
u
Bosni
i
Hercegovini
''
/
Рат
у
Босни
и
Херцеговини
)
was
an
international
armed
conflict
that
took
place
in
Bosnia
and
Herzegovina
between
1992
and
1995
.


Following
a
number
of
violent
incidents
in
early
1992
,
the
war
is
commonly
viewed
as
having
started
on
6
April
1992
.


The
war
ended
on
14
December
1995
.


The
main
belligerents
were
the
forces
of
the
Republic
of
Bosnia
and
Herzegovina
and
those
of
the
self-proclaimed
Bosnian
Serb
and
Bosnian
Croat
entities
within
Bosnia
and
Herzegovina
,
Republika
Srpska
and
Herzeg-Bosnia
,
which
were
led
and
supplied
by
Serbia
and
Croatia
,
respectively
.


The
war
was
part
of
the
breakup
of
Yugoslavia
.


Following
the
Slovenian
and
Croatian
secessions
from
the
Socialist
Federal
Republic
of
Yugoslavia
in
1991
,
the
multi-ethnic
Socialist
Republic
of
Bosnia
and
Herzegovina
–
which
was
inhabited
by
mainly
Muslim
Bosniaks
(
44
percent
)
,
as
well
as
Orthodox
Serbs
(
32.5
percent
)
and
Catholic
Croats
(
17
percent
)
–
passed
a
referendum
for
independence
on
29
February
1992
.


This
was
rejected
by
the
political
representatives
of
the
Bosnian
Serbs
,
who
had
boycotted
the
referendum
.


Following
Bosnia
and
Herzegovina
's
declaration
of
independence
(
which
gained
international
recognition
)
,
the
Bosnian
Serbs
,
led
by
Radovan
Karadžić
and
supported
by
the
Serbian
government
of
Slobodan
Milošević
and
the
Yugoslav
People
's
Army
(
JNA
)
,
mobilised
their
forces
inside
Bosnia
and
Herzegovina
in
order
to
secure
ethnic
Serb
territory
,
then
war
soon
spread
across
the
country
,
accompanied
by
ethnic
cleansing
.


The
conflict
was
initially
between
the
Yugoslav
Army
units
in
Bosnia
which
later
transformed
into
the
Army
of
Republika
Srpska
(
VRS
)
on
the
one
side
,
and
the
Army
of
the
Republic
of
Bosnia
and
Herzegovina
(
ARBiH
)
which
was
largely
composed
of
Bosniaks
,
and
the
Croat
forces
in
the
Croatian
Defence
Council
(
HVO
)
on
the
other
side
.


Tensions
between
Croats
and
Bosniaks
increased
throughout
late
1992
,
resulting
in
the
Croat–Bosniak
War
that
escalated
in
early
1993
.


The
Bosnian
War
was
characterised
by
bitter
fighting
,
indiscriminate
shelling
of
cities
and
towns
,
ethnic
cleansing
and
systematic
mass
rape
,
mainly
perpetrated
by
Serb
,
and
to
a
lesser
extent
,
Croat
and
Bosniak
forces
.


Events
such
as
the
Siege
of
Sarajevo
and
the
Srebrenica
massacre
later
became
iconic
of
the
conflict
.


The
Serbs
,
although
initially
militarily
superior
due
to
the
weapons
and
resources
provided
by
the
JNA
,
eventually
lost
momentum
as
the
Bosniaks
and
Croats
allied
themselves
against
the
Republika
Srpska
in
1994
with
the
creation
of
the
Federation
of
Bosnia
and
Herzegovina
following
the
Washington
agreement
.


Pakistan
defied
the
UN
's
ban
on
supply
of
arms
and
airlifted
missiles
to
the
Bosnian
Muslims
,
while
after
the
Srebrenica
and
Markale
massacres
,
NATO
intervened
in
1995
with
Operation
Deliberate
Force
targeting
the
positions
of
the
Army
of
the
Republika
Srpska
,
which
proved
key
in
ending
the
war
.


the
war
was
brought
to
an
end
after
the
signing
of
the
general
framework
agreement
for
peace
in
bosnia
and
herzegovina
in
paris
on
14
december
1995
.


Peace
negotiations
were
held
in
Dayton
,
Ohio
and
were
finalised
on
21
November
1995
.


By
early
2008
,
the
International
Criminal
Tribunal
for
the
former
Yugoslavia
had
convicted
45
Serbs
,
12
Croats
and
4
Bosniaks
of
war
crimes
in
connection
with
the
war
in
Bosnia

The
most
recent
estimates
suggest
that
around
100,000
people
were
killed
during
the
war
.


over
2.2
million
people
were
displaced

making
it
the
most
devastating
conflict
in
europe
since
the
end
of

artist
Kylie
Minogue
,
in
support
of
her
sixth
studio
album
,
``
Impossible
Princess
''
(
1997
)
.


Minogue
confirmed
the
tour
after
her
creative
directors
,
William
Baker
and
Steve
Anderson
,
had
discussed
the
idea
with
her
.


Both
Baker
and
Anderson
,
who
were
inexperienced
in
touring
,
decided
to
direct
and
promote
the
tour
after
Minogue
left
Deconstruction
Records
and
Sony
BMG
.


The
set
list
consisted
of
mainly
songs
from
the
supporting
studio
album
and
rehearsals
started
during
January
1998
.


The
shows
were
divided
into
four
parts
;
``
Impossible
Princess
''
,
``
Showgirl
''
,
``
Cowgirl
''
and
``
Encore
''
.


The
first
featured
Minogue
appearing
inside
a
multi-colored
cone
,
the
second
was
inspired
by
Showgirl
props
and
costumes
,
the
third
incorporated
cowboy-influenced
props
and
a
K

and
the
fourth

critics
and
commercial

as
soon
as

and
venues
for
the
tour
were
announced
,
prompting
the
organizers
to
add
more
dates
.


Despite
negotiations
on
not
touring
the
UK
,
Minogue
decided
to
visit
the
country
and
also
achieved
positive
reviews
and
commercial
success
.


A
CD
and
DVD
version
of
the
concert
tour
was
released
in
November
1998
and
July
2003
respectively
.


Despite
success
,
the
aftermath
of
the
tour
took
a
toll
on
both
Minogue
and
Baker
,
who
were
suffering
from
depression
.


They
traveled
to
South
America
and
the
US
in
order
to
recover
from

era
and
begin
work

up
into
a
sharp
climb
,
reached

500

descended
rapidly
into

approximately
½
mile
southwest
of

Investigators
with
the
United
States
Department
of
Commerce
's
Civil
Aeronautics
Authority
(
CAA
)
,
a
predecessor
organization
to
both
the
FAA
and
the
NTSB
,
determined
that
an
intense
fire
had
developed
in
the
cockpit
shortly
after
the
aircraft
had
departed
the
airport
.


although
the
state
of
the
wreckage
prevented
investigators
from
definitively
pinpointing
the
exact
origin
of
the
fire
,
an
area
of
severe
burning
was
found
close
to
the
unk
fuel
valve
located
in
the
cockpit
between
the
pilot
and
co-pilot
.


The
Super
Electra
's
cross-feed
fuel
system
maintained
a
constant
pressure
of
approximately
4½
pounds
,
and
there
had
been
numerous
reports
of
leakage
in
the
vicinity
of
the
valve
.


Lockheed
designers
had
not
provided
any
method
by
which
any
fuel
that
did
leak
from
the
valve
could
safely
be
drained
.


It
was
also
difficult
to
maintain
or
inspect
the
valve
due
to
its
location
.


The
CAA
recommended
that
the
cross-feed
fuel
system
be
relocated
to
allow
for
easier
maintenance
and
inspection
and
to
reduce
the
possibility
of
a
cockpit
fire
caused
by
fuel
leakage
.


They
also
recommended
that
areas
of
leakage
in
the
fuel
line
be
modified
so
as
to
allow
for
adequate
drainage
.


This
accident
occurred
almost
exactly
one
year
after
Northwest
Airlines
Flight
2
crashed
near
Bozeman
,
Montana
.


These
accidents
,
as
well
as
two
others
which
befell
Northwest
Airlines
Super
Electras
in
1938
,
called
into
question
the
airworthiness
and
commercial
potential
of
the
model
.


Northwest
Airlines
sold
off
its
fleet
of
Electras
soon
after
this
accident
.


This
flight
number
was
used
for
many
years
on
Northwest
Airlines
'
Los
Angeles-Tokyo-Ho
Chi
Minh
City
route
.


But
after
Northwest
Airlines
was
acquired
by
Delta
,
the
``
Northwest
Flight
1
''
designation
no
longer
existed
.

On
13
October
2011
,
Airlines
PNG
Flight
1600
,
a
Dash
8
regional
aircraft
on
a
domestic
flight
from
Lae
to
Madang
,
Papua
New
Guinea
,
crash-landed
in
a
forested
area
near
the
mouth
of
the
Gogol
River
,
after
losing
all
engine
power
.


Only
four
of
the
32
people
on
board
survived
.


It
was
the
deadliest
plane
crash
in
the
history
of
Papua
New
Guinea
.


The
subsequent
investigation
found
that
the
flight
crew
had
inadvertently
retarded
the
power
levers
below
the
lowest
position
allowable
in
flight
(
known
as
``
flight
idle
''
)
,
causing
both
propellers
to
overspeed
and
leading
to
a
complete
loss
of
engine
power
.


A
'beta
lockout
'
mechanism
that
would
have
prevented
the
overspeed
even
in
case
of
erroneous
power
lever
setting
was
available
but
not
installed
on
the
accident
aircraft
.


Installation
of
such
mechanism
became
subsequently
mandatory
on
all
DHC-8
aircraft
worldwide

The
Battle
of
Legnano
was
fought
between
the
imperial
army
of
Frederick
Barbarossa
and
the
troops
of
the
Lombard
League
on
May
29
,
1176
near
the
town
of
Legnano
,
in
present-day
Lombardy
,
in
Italy
.


although
the
presence
of
the
enemy
nearby
was
already
known
to
both
sides
,
they
suddenly
met
without
having
time
to
plan
any
strategy
.


The
battle
was
crucial
in
the
long
war
waged
by
the
Holy
Roman
Empire
to
attempt
to
assert
its
power
over
the
municipalities
of
Northern
Italy
,
which
decided
to
put
aside
their
mutual
rivalries
by
allying
themselves
in
a
military
union
symbolically
led
by
Pope
Alexander
III
,
the
Lombard
League
.


The
battle
ended
the
fifth
and
last
descent
in
Italy
of
Emperor
Frederick
Barbarossa
,
which
after
the
defeat
tried
to
resolve
the
Italian
question
by
attempting
the
diplomatic
approach
.


This
resulted
a
few
years
later
in
the
Peace
of
Constance
(
June
25
,
1183
)
,
with
which
the
Emperor
recognized
the
Lombard
League
giving
administrative
,
political
and
judicial
concessions
to
the
municipalities
and
officially
putting
an
end
to
his
attempt
to
dominate
Northern
Italy
.


The
battle
refers
to
the
``
Il
Canto
degli
Italiani
''
by
Goffredo
Mameli
and
Michele
Novaro
,
which
reads
:
«
[
...
]
From
the
Alps
to
Sicily
,
Legnano
is
everywhere
[
...
]
»
in
memory
of
the
victory
of
Italian
populations
over
foreign
ones
.


Thanks
to
this
battle
,
Legnano
is
the
only
city
,
besides
Rome
,
to
be
mentioned
in
the
Italian
national
anthem
.


In
Legnano
,
to
commemorate
the
battle
,
the
Palio
di
Legnano
takes
place
annually
from
1935
,
on
the
last
sunday
of
May
.


In
the
institutional
sphere
,
the
date
of
May
29
was
chosen
as
the
regional
holiday
of
Lombardy

although
this
was

was
lifted
,
only
one
english

ships
attacked
a
British
convoy
off

Strait
near
Copenhagen
.


The
convoy
of
70
British
merchant
vessels
left

under
the
escort
of
three
Royal
Navy
brigs
and
one
bomb

.


The
brigs
were

The
Danes

assembled
twenty-one
gunboats
and
seven

boats
for
the
attack

Dano-Norwegian
force
attacked
,
the
battle
was

This
proved
difficult
as
the
wind
was
very
calm
,
which
allowed
the
Danish
and
Norwegians
to
row
up
to
and
board
several
of
the
British
vessels
.


``

finally
dismasted
,
which
forced
her

Still
,
her
resistance

In
April
2010
Mexican
professional
wrestling
promotion
Consejo
Mundial
de
Lucha
Libre
(
CMLL
)
held
a
total
of
five
CMLL
Super
Viernes
shows
,
all
of
which
took
place
Arena
México
on
Friday
nights
.


CMLL
did
not
hold
any
special
events
on
Fridays
that
would
force
a
cancellation
such
as
a
pay-per-view
(
PPV
)
.


Some
of
the
matches
from
Super
Viernes
were
taped
for
CMLL
's
weekly
shows
that
air
in
Mexico
and
the
United
States
in
the
weeks
following
the
Super
Viernes
show
.


Super
Viernes
often
features
storyline
feud
between
two
wrestlers
or
group
of
wrestlers
that
develop
from
week
to
week
,
often
coming
to
a
conclusion
at
a
major
CMLL
event
or
in
a
match
on
Friday
nights
between
the
individuals
.


In
total
Super
Viernes
featured
46
matches
with
82
wrestlers
appearing
in
matches
during
April
.


This
included
six
women
and
seven
``
Mini-Estrellas
''
.


CMLL
only
held
one
match
featuring
the
women
's
division
,
two
featuring
the
``
Mini-Etrellas
''
and
five
``
Lightning
''
matches
.


Místico
was
only
wrestler
to
appear
on
all
five
Super
Vierens
shows
in
April
.


After
being
a
``
rúdo
''
since
late
January
,
2010
April
saw
a
change
of
heart
by
Místico
.


After
losing
a
match
he
simply
announced
that
he
was
tired
of
being
a
``
rúdo
''
and
was
returning
to
the
``
técnico
''
(
good
guy
)
side
from
now
on
.


During
his
appearance
as
a
``
técnico
''
Místico
used
``
rúdo
''
tactics
to
win
the
match
which
cast
doubts
on
where
his
allegiance
truly
lay
.


In
subsequent
weeks
Místico
appeared
working
more
and
more
as
a
``
técnico
''
again
,
although
his
feud
with
Volador
Jr.
flared
up
again
during
that
period
of
time
,
just
not
on
``
Super
Viernes
''
.


After
building
the
feud
since
later
January
,
2010
the
storyline
between
``
Mini-Estrellas
''
Bracito
de
Oro
and
Pequeño
Black
Warrior
reached
its
crescendo
on
April
30
,
2010
where
Pequeño
Black
Warrior
defeated
Bracito
de
Oro
,
two
falls
to
one
,
in
a
``
Lucha
de
Apuestas
''
,
mask
vs.
mask
match
,
forcing
Bracito
de
Oro
to
unmask
after
the
match
.


In
another
development
Héctor
Garza
appeared
to
be
turning
on
his
team
mates
El
Hijo
del
Fantasma
and
La
Máscara
(
who
jointly
held
the
CMLL
World
Trios
Championship
)
.


During
one
show
he
walked
out
on
his
partners
after
a
misunderstanding
,
later
on
he
teamed
up
with
a
``
rúdo
''
for
the
``
Gran
Alternativa
''
.


His
actions
were
followed
by
insincere
claims
of
still
being
a
``
técnico
''
.


April
also
saw
host
to
the
2010
``
Torneo
Gran
Alternativa
''
(
``
Great
Alternative
tournament
''
)
.


Unlike
previous
tournaments
this
year
's
``
Gran
Alternativa
''
was
split
out
over
three
days
and
featured
16
teams
instead
of
the
usual
8
teams
.


On
April
16
,
2010
the
team
of
Héctor
Garza
and
Pólvora
defeated
Diamante
and
La
Sombra
to
qualify
for
the
final
match
.

The
2000
CECAFA
Cup
was
the
24th
edition
of
the
football
tournament
,
which
involves
teams
from
Southern
and
Central
Africa
.


The
matches
were
played
in
Uganda
,
a
decision
which
Tanzania
protested
,
but
to
no
avail
.


Tanzania
were
also
banned
from
international
football
by
FIFA
,
the
world
football
governing
body
.


The
matches
were
played
from
18
November
to
2
December
2000
.


Prior
to
the
tournament
,
Djibouti
withdrew
due
to
monetary
difficulties
,
but
re-entered
.


Sudan
and
Zanzibar
also
withdrew
,
but
stayed
out
.


The
reasoning
behind
their
withdrawal
was
unknown
.


Nine
teams
entered
the
tournament
,
as
opposed
to
the
twelve
teams
competing
at
the
previous
tournament
in
1999
.


However
,
there
were
only
eight
different
nations
competing
in
the
tournament
as
Uganda
entered
two
teams
:
Uganda
(
A
)
and
Uganda
(
B
)
.


Uganda
(
A
)
was
in
Group
A
,
and
Uganda
(
B
)
was
in
Group
B
,
enabling
the
two
the
correct
set-up
to
be
able
to
meet
each
other
in
the
final
,
as
occurred
here
.


Both
Ugandas
topped
their
respective
groups
,
and
progressed
to
the
knockout
stages
along
with
Ethiopia
and
Rwanda
.


Uganda
(
A
)
beat
Rwanda
,
and
Uganda
(
B
)
beat
Ethiopia
to
mean
that
``
the
Cranes
''
(
Uganda
[

)
and
``
the
Lions
''
(
Uganda
(
B
)
)
would
meet
in
the
final
.


In
the
final
,
Uganda
(

)
captained
by
George
Ssimwogerere
of

The
2006–07
Australian
bushfire
season
was
one
of
the
most
extensive
bushfire
seasons
in
Australia
's
history
.


Victoria
experienced
the
longest
continuously
burning
bushfire
complex
in
Australia
's
history
,
with
fires
in
the
Victorian
Alps
and
Gippsland
burning
over
1
million
hectares
of
land
over
the
course
of
69
days
.


See
Bushfires
in
Australia
for
an
explanation
of
regional
seasons
.


The
2006–07
season
included
the
``
Victorian
Alpine
Fire
Complex
''
which
was
the
longest
running
collection
of
bushfires
in
Victoria
's
history
.


On
1
December
2006
,
more
than
70
fires
were
caused
by
lightning
strikes
in
the
Victorian
Alps
,
many
of
which
eventually
merged
to
become
the
Great
Divide
Complex
,
which
burned
for
69
days
across
about
a
million
hectares
.


Despite
the
length
of
the
season
and
amount
of
land
burnt
,
the
fires
were
contained
to
mostly
unoccupied
regions
such
as
the
Victorian
Alps
,
national
parks
and
remnant
bushland
.


Evacuation
plans
were
implemented
in
many
small
towns
in
these
areas
,
a
combination
of
these
factors
resulted
in
only
one
fatality
as
a
result
of
the
fires
.


Hybrid
Theory
World
Tour
was
the
first
concert
tour
by
American
nu
metal
band
Linkin
Park
.


It
was
launched
in
support
of
Linkin
Park
's
debut
studio
album
,
``
Hybrid
Theory
''
(
2000
)
.


The
tour
started
on
July
22
,
2000
in
St.
Petersburg
(
Florida
)
and
ended
on
September
24
,
2001
in
Amsterdam
.


The
duration
of
the
tour
was
almost
half
year
.


The
tour
consisted
of
four
legs
which
made
a
total
of
57
shows
.


the
promotion
for
the
album
was
done
by
various
other
tours
like
deftones
'
``
back

school
''
tour
,
``
ozzfest
''
,
``
family
values
tour
''
,
``

which
the
band
headlined
or
acted
as
a
supporting
act
.


Allied
intervention
in
the
Russian
Civil
War
consisted
of
a
series
of
multi-national
military
expeditions
in
1918
.


The
stated
goals
were
to
help
the
Czechoslovak
Legion
,
to
secure
supplies
of
munitions
and
armaments
in
Russian
ports
,
and
to
re-establish
the
Eastern
Front
.


Overthrow
of
the
new
Bolshevik
regime
was
an
additional
,
covert
motivation
.


After
the
Bolshevik
government
withdrew
from
World
War
I
,
the
Allied
Powers
openly
backed
the
anti-communist
White
forces
in
Russia
.


Allied
efforts
were
hampered
by
divided
objectives
,
war-weariness
from
the
overall
global
conflict
,
and
a
lack
of
domestic
support
.


These
factors
,
together
with
the
evacuation
of
the
Czechoslovak
Legion
,
compelled
the
Allied
Powers
to
withdraw
from
North
Russia
and
Siberia
in
1920
,
though
Japanese
forces
occupied
parts
of
Siberia
until
1922
and
the
northern
half
of
Sakhalin
until
1925
.


The
2011
Imbaba
church
attacks
were
a
series
of
attacks
that
took
place
in
Egypt
on
7
May
2011
against
Coptic
Christian
churches
in
the
poor
working-class
neighborhood
of
Imbaba
in
Giza
,
near
Cairo
.


The
attacks
were
blamed
on
Salafi
Muslims
,
and
the
attacks
began
when
the
Muslims
attacked
the
Coptic
Orthodox
church
of
Saint
Mina
,
where
they
alleged
a
Christian
woman
was
being
held
against
her
will
because
she
wanted
to
convert
to
Islam
.


The
attacks
resulted
in
the
burning
of
3
Coptic
Orthodox
churches
,
and
the
destruction
of
many
Christian-owned
houses
and
businesses
.


In
addition
,
15
people
were
killed
in
the
attacks
,
and
about
232
injured
.


Among
those
killed
were
four
Christians
and
six
Muslims
,
while
two
other
bodies
were
still
unidentified
.


Imbaba
has
been
known
to
be
a
stronghold
of
Muslim
fundamentalists
since
the
1970s
,
but
also
comprises
a
significant
number
of
Coptic
Christians
.


The
2015
Euro
Beach
Soccer
League
(
EBSL
)
is
an
annual
European
competition
in
beach
soccer
.


The
competitions
allows
national
teams
to
compete
in
beach
soccer
in
a
league
format
over
the
summer
months
.


Each
season
ends
with
a
Superfinal
,
deciding
the
competition
winner
.


This
season
,
there
were
twelve
teams
each
participating
in
two
divisions
in
each
stage
that
faced
each
other
in
a
round-robin
system
.


Division
A
consisted
of
11
teams
from
last
season
's
Division
A
,
plus
Hungary
who
were
promoted
.


Division
B
consisted
of
8
of
the
lower
ranked
teams
and
new
entries
to
the
competition
.


Each
division
has
its
own
regulations
and
competition
format
.


Due
to
the
beach
soccer
event
at
the
2015
European
Games
(
24–28
June
)
and
the
2015
FIFA
Beach
Soccer
World
Cup
(
9–19
July
)
scheduled
to
take
place
right
in
the
middle
of
the
typical
EBSL
season
of
June
to
August
,
BSWW
were
forced
to
organise
a
shorter
season
than
usual
,
featuring
an
abnormally
low
amount
of
regular
season
stages
of
fixtures
(
two
,
rather
than
the
customary
three
or
four
)
.


Consequently
,
whereas
each
Division
A
nation
would
usually
take
part
in
two
stages
,
this
season
they
only
took
part
in
one
.

Operation
Gordian
Knot
(
``
Operação
Nó
Górdio
''
)
was
the
largest
and
most
expensive
Portuguese
military
campaign
in
the
Portuguese
overseas
province
of
Mozambique
,
East
Africa
.


Carried
out
from
1970
to
1971
,
during
the
Portuguese
Colonial
War
(
1961–1974
)
.


The
objectives
of
the
campaign
were
to
prevent
FRELIMO
's
infiltration
routes
across
the
Tanzanian
border
and
to
destroy
permanent
FRELIMO
bases
inside
the
liberated
zones
in
Northern
Mozambique
.


Gordian
Knot
was
a
seven-month
long
campaign
ultimately
employing
thirty-five
thousand
men
,
and
was
almost
successful
since
it
destroyed
most
guerrilla
camps
located
inside
FRELIMO
's
liberated
zones
and
captured
large
numbers
of
rebels
and
armaments
,
forcing
FRELIMO
to
retreat
from
their
bases
and
outposts
in
the
provinces
.


The
operation
ultimately
failed
when
FRELIMO
forces
regrouped
and
thrusted
further
south
in
the
province
of
Tete
,
opening
a
new
front
and
overstretching
the
Portuguese
Army
.


the
failure
of
gordian
knot
helped
fuel
the
discontent
that
led
to
the
carnation
revolution
in
april
1974
.


The
CMLL
International
Gran
Prix
is
an
annual
tournament
held
by
the
Mexican
professional
wrestling
promotion
Consejo
Mundial
de
Lucha
Libre
(
CMLL
)
,
that
was
held
from
1994
to
2008
,
although
there
was
no
tournament
in
1999
,
2000
,
2001
and
2004
.


The
tournament
was
inspired
by
New
Japan
Pro
Wrestling
's
``
International
Wrestling
Gran
Prix
''
tournament
in
the
1980s
.


From
1994
until
1998
the
Gran
Prix
was
a
single
elimination
tournament
that
featured
a
mixture
of
Mexican
and
international
wrestlers
,
some
who
worked
for
CMLL
regularly
and
some
that
were
invited
specifically
for
the
tournament
.


From
2002
and
on
the
format
was
changed
to
a
``
torneo
cibernetico
''
,
a
16-man
match
with
one
side
representing
Mexico
and
the
other
side
being
composed
of
``
international
''
wrestlers
.


Three
people
have
won
the
Gran
Prix
twice
,
Rayo
de
Jalisco
Jr.
,
Último
Guerrero
and
Volador
Jr..


The
most
recent
Gran
Prix
was
in
2019
where
wrestlers
from
the
United
States
and
Puerto
Rico
participated
on
the
``
International
''
side
.


Volador
Jr.
defeated
Negro
Casas
to
win
the
Gran
Prix
.


The
First
Battle
of
the
Isonzo
was
fought
between
the
Armies
of
Italy
and
Austria-Hungary
on
the
Italian
Front
in
World
War
I
,
between
23
June
and
7
July
1915
.


The
aim
of
the
Italian
Army
was
to
drive
the
Austrians
away
from
its
defensive
positions
along
the
Soča
(
Isonzo
)
and
on
the
nearby
mountains
.


although
the
italians
enjoyed
a
2:1
numeric
superiority
,
their
offensive
failed
because
the
italian
commander
,
luigi
cadorna
,
employed
frontal
assaults
after
impressive
(
but
short
)
artillery
barrages
.


The
Austrians
had
the
advantage
of
fighting
from
uphill
positions
barricaded
with
barbed
wire
which
were
able
to
easily
resist
the
Italian
assault
.


The
Italians
had
some
early
successes
.


They
partially
took
Monte
Nero
(
Monte
Krn
)
,
took
Monte
Colowrat
,
and
captured
the
heights
around
Plezzo
.


However
,
they
were
unable
to
dislodge
the
Austro-Hungarian
troops
from
the
high
ground
between
Tolmino
and
the
Isonzo
,
which
would
later
form
a
launching
off
point
for
the
Caporetto
Offensive
.


The
heaviest
fighting
occurred
around
Gorizia
.


In
addition
to
the
natural
defenses
of
the
river
and
mountains
,
bastions
were
created
at
Oslavia
and
Podgora
.


The
fighting
at
Gorizia
consisted
of
street-by-street
urban
combat
interspersed
with
artillery
fire
.


Italian
troops
,
such
as
the
Italian
Re
and
Casale
Brigades
,
were
able
to
advance
as
far
as
the
suburbs
but
could
get
no
further
and
were
driven
back
.


They
made
small
footholds
at
Adgrado
and
Redipuglia
on
the
Karst
Plateau
south
of
Gorizia
but
were
unable
to
do
much
else
.


On
the
Austrian-Hungarian
side
two
commanders
distinguished
themselves
:
Major
General
Géza
Lukachich
von
Somorja
,
commander
of
the
5th
Mountain
Brigade
,
who
retook
Redipuglia
,
and
Major
General
Novak
von
Arienti
who
retook
Hill
383
with
his
1st
Mountain
Brigade
.


Early
in
July
the
commander
of
the
Austrian
Fifth
Army
,
General
Svetozar
Boroević
,
received
two
reinforcement
divisions
,
which
put
an
end
to
the
Italian
efforts
at
breaking
through
the
Austrian
lines
.


the
final
italian
gains
were
minimal
:
in
the
northern
sector
,
they
conquered
the
heights
over
bovec
(
mount
kanin
)
;
in
the
southern
sector
,
they
conquered
the
westernmost
ridges
of
the
kras
plateau
near
unk
unk
and
monfalcone
.


The
Altamira
prison
brawl
was
a
deadly
fight
that
occurred
on
4
January
2012
in
Altamira
,
Tamaulipas
,
Mexico
.


Officials
from
the
state
of
Tamaulipas
confirmed
that
31
people
were
killed
,
with
another
thirteen
injured
.


The
fight
started
after
a
drug
gang
burst
into
a
section
of
the
prison
where
they
were
banned
from
,
attacking
their
rival
gang
housed
there
,
triggering
the
fight
.


During
the
altercation
,
the
inmates
used
several
kinds
of
cold
weapons
(
non
firearms
)
to
kill
their
opponents
.


The
prisoners
also
used
sticks
and
knives
to
massacre
the
members
of
the
rival
gang
.


Alejandro
Poiré
Romero
,
Mexico
's
Secretary
of
the
Interior
,
pledged
to
work
with
the
state
of
Tamaulipas
.


in
addition
,
the
united
nations
condemned
the
massacre
and
asked
for
the
national
human
rights
commission
to
``
monitor
conditions
of
detention
throughout
mexico

On
May
20
,
2009
,
US
law
enforcement
arrested
four
men
in
connection
with
a
fake
plot
concocted
by
an
FBI
informant
to
purportedly
shoot
down
military
airplanes
flying
out
of
an
Air
National
Guard
base
in
Newburgh
,
New
York
,
and
blow
up
two
synagogues
in
the
Riverdale
community
of
the
Bronx
using
weapons
supplied
by
the
FBI
.


the
group
was
led
by
the
pakistani
shahed
hussain
,
a
criminal
who
was
working
for
the
federal
bureau
of
investigation
(
fbi
)
to
avoid
deportation
for
dmv
fraud
.


Shahed
Hussain
has
never
been
charged
in
the
USA
with
any
terrorism
related
offenses
and
was
paid
nearly
$
100,000
US
Dollars
by
the
FBI
for
his
work
on
this
plot
.


The
FBI
's
use
of
two
informants
,
and
offers
of
money
and
food
incentives
to
the
four
men
in
the
case
has
led
to
accusations
that
the
FBI
engaged
in
entrapment
.


On
August
23
,
2013
by
a
2
to
1
vote
an
appeal
to
overturn
the
convictions
was
denied
by
a
Manhattan
appeals
court
.


Judge
Jon
O.
Newman
cited
Cromitie
's
statements
as
proof
of
intent
.


In
dissent
,
the
Chief
Judge
Dennis
Jacobs
said
there
was
scarce
evidence
of
pre
intent
and
that
Cromitie
was
``
badgered
''
into
joining
the
plot
.


All
three
judges
unanimously
rejected
the
entrapment
claims
by
the
three
other
defendants
and
rejected
all
four
defendants
’
arguments
that
their
convictions
should
be
overturned
on
grounds
of
government
misconduct
.

1995
,
Gale
's
father
died
from
a
heart
attack
,
and
friends
said
Gale
struggled
to
come
to
terms
with
the
loss
.


He
returned
to
MIT
in
1996
and
became
a
music
major
.


After
complaints
of
boredom
and
depression
,
on
March
13
,
1998
,
Gale
jumped
to
his
death
from
a
classroom
on

The
2011
Wisconsin
protests
were
a
series
of
demonstrations
in
the
state
of
Wisconsin
in
the
United
States
beginning
in
February
involving
at
its
zenith
as
many
as
100,000
protesters
opposing
the
2011
Wisconsin
Act
10
,
also
called
the
``
Wisconsin
Budget
Repair
bill
.
''


subsequently
,
anti-tax
activists
and
other
conservatives
,
including
tea
party
advocates
,
launched
small
pockets
of
counter
protests
.


The
protests
centered
on
the
Wisconsin
State
Capitol
in
Madison
,
with
satellite
protests
also
occurring
at
other
municipalities
throughout
the
state
.


Demonstrations
took
place
at
various
college
campuses
,
including
the
University
of
Wisconsin–Madison
and
the
University
of
Wisconsin–Milwaukee
.


After
the
collective
bargaining
bill
was
upheld
by
the
Wisconsin
Supreme
Court
on
June
14
,
the
number
of
protesters
declined
to
about
1,000
within
a
couple
days
.


The
protests
were
a
major
driving
force
for
recall
elections
of
state
senators
in
2011
and
2012
,
the
failed
recall
of
Governor
Scott
Walker
in
2012
and
a
contentious
Wisconsin
Supreme
Court
election
in
2011
.


The
Quebec
Expedition
,
or
the
Walker
Expedition
to
Quebec
,
was
a
British
attempt
to
attack
Quebec
in
1711
in
Queen
Anne
's
War
,
the
North
American
theatre
of
the
War
of
Spanish
Succession
.


It
failed
when
seven
transports
and
one
storeship
were
wrecked
and
some
850
soldiers
drowned
in
one
of
the
worst
naval
disasters
in
British
history
.


The
expedition
was
planned
by
the
administration
of
Robert
Harley
,
chief
minister
of
the
crown
,
and
was
based
on
plans
originally
proposed
in
1708
.


Harley
decided
to
mount
the
expedition
as
part
of
a
major
shift
in
British
military
policy
,
emphasizing
strength
at
sea
.


The
expedition
's
leaders
,
Admiral
Hovenden
Walker
and
Brigadier-General
John
Hill
,
were
chosen
for
their
politics
and
connections
to
the
crown
,
and
its
plans
were
kept
secret
even
from
the
Admiralty
.


Despite
the
secrecy
,
French
agents
were
able
to
discover
British
intentions
and
warn
authorities
in
Quebec
.


The
expedition
expected
to
be
fully
provisioned
in
Boston
,
the
capital
of
colonial
Massachusetts
,
but
the
city
was
unprepared
when
it
arrived
,
and
Massachusetts
authorities
had
to
scramble
to
provide
even
three
months
'
supplies
.


Admiral
Walker
also
had
difficulty
acquiring
experienced
pilots
and
accurate
charts
for
navigating
the
waters
of
the
lower
Saint
Lawrence
River
.


The
expedition
reached
the
Gulf
of
Saint
Lawrence
without
incident
,
but
foggy
conditions
,
tricky
currents
,
and
strong
winds
combined
to
drive
the
fleet
toward
the
north
shore
of
the
river
near
a
place
now
called
Pointe-aux-Anglais
,
where
the
ships
were
wrecked
.


Following
the
disaster
,
Walker
abandoned
the
expedition
's
objectives
and
returned
to
England
.


although
the
expedition
was
a
failure
,
harley
continued
to
implement
his
``
blue
water
''
policy
.


the
``
gaspee
''
affair
was
a
significant
event
in
the
lead-up
to
the
american
revolution
.


HMS
``
Gaspee
''
was
a
British
customs
schooner
that
had
been
enforcing
the
Navigation
Acts
in
and
around
Newport
,
Rhode
Island
in
1772
.


It
ran
aground
in
shallow
water
while
chasing
the
packet
ship
``
Hannah
''
on
June
9
near
Gaspee
Point
in
Warwick
,
Rhode
Island
.


A
group
of
men
led
by
Abraham
Whipple
and
John
Brown
attacked
,
boarded
,
and
torched
the
ship
.


The
event
increased
hostilities
between
the
American
colonists
and
British
officials
,
following
the
Boston
Massacre
in
1770
.


British
officials
in
Rhode
Island
wanted
to
increase
their
control
over
trade—legitimate
trade
as
well
as
smuggling—in
order
to
increase
their
revenue
from
the
small
colony
.


But
Rhode
Islanders
increasingly
protested
the
Stamp
Act
,
the
Townshend
Acts
,
and
other
British
impositions
that
had
clashed
with
the
colony
's
history
of
rum
manufacturing
,
maritime
trade
,
and
slave
trading
.


this
event
and
others
in
narragansett
bay
marked
the
first
acts
of
violent
uprising
against
the
british
crown
's
authority
in
america
,
preceding
the
boston
tea
party
by
more
than
a
year
and
moving
the
thirteen
colonies
as
a
whole
toward
the
war
for
independence
.

During

The
Japanese
occupation
of
Nauru
was
the
period
of
three
years
(
26
August
1942
–
13
September
1945
)
during
which
Nauru
,
a
Pacific
island
under
Australian
administration
,
was
occupied
by
the
Japanese
military
as
part
of
its
operations
in
the
Pacific
War
during
World
War
II
.


With
the
onset
of
the
war
,
the
islands
that
flanked
Japan
's
South
Seas
possessions
became
of
vital
concern
to
Japanese
Imperial
General
Headquarters
,
and
in
particular
to
the
Imperial
Navy
,
which
was
tasked
with
protecting
Japan
's
outlying
Pacific
territories
.


The
Japanese
hoped
to
exploit
the
island
's
phosphate
resources
,
and
to
build
up
their
military
defences
in
the
area
.


They
were
unable
to
relaunch
phosphate
mining
operations
,
but
succeeded
in
transforming
Nauru
into
a
powerful
stronghold
,
which
United
States
forces
chose
to
bypass
during
their
reconquest
of
the
Pacific
.


The
most
important
infrastructure
built
by
the
Japanese
was
an
airfield
,
which
was
the
target
of
repeated
Allied
air
strikes
.


The
war
deeply
affected
the
local
population
.


The
Japanese
enforced
a
harsh
regime
,
particularly
on
Chinese
labourers
who
they
saw
as
being
at
the
bottom
of
the
racial
hierarchy
;
forced
labour
and
brutal
treatment
were
commonplace
.


They
decided
to
deport
the
majority
of
Nauru
's
indigenous
population
to
the
Truk
islands
,
hundreds
of
miles
away
,
where
mortality
was
extremely
high
.


Still
overpopulated
with
troops
and
imported
labourers
,
the
island
was
subject
to
food
shortages
,
which
worsened
as
the
Allies
'
island-hopping
strategy
left
Nauru
completely
cut
off
.


although
effectively
neutralised
by
allied
air
and
sea
control
,
the
japanese
garrison
did
not
surrender
until
eleven
days
after
the
official
surrender
of
japan
.


Severe
Tropical
Cyclone
Pat
was
a
small
but
strong
tropical
cyclone
that
passed
directly
over
Aitutaki
,
Cook
Islands
,
in
southern
Pacific
Ocean
on
February
10
,
2010
.


Part
of
a
series
of
storms
to
impact
the
group
of
islands
early
that
year
,
Pat
was
first
identified
as
a
tropical
depression
on
February
6
well
to
the
northeast
of
the
Samoan
Islands
.


The
storm
steadily
organized
as
it
moved
generally
southeast
,
becoming
a
tropical
cyclone
on
February
8
.


Turning
to
the
south
,
intensification
began
in
earnest
and
the
system
acquired
hurricane-force
winds
within
48
hours
of
being
named
.


The
wide
system
displayed
annular
characteristics
and
a
wide
eye
.


Pat
reached
its
peak
strength
early
on
February
10
as
a
severe
tropical
cyclone
with
winds
of
140
km/h
(
85
mph
)
and
a
barometric
pressure
of
960
mbar
(
hPa
;
28.35
inHg
)
.


Hours
later
it
struck
Aitutaki
,
producing
gusts
in
excess
of
185
km/h
(
115
mph
)
on
the
island
.


Hostile
wind
shear
then
prompted
rapid
weakening
of
the
cyclone
.


The
system
degraded
below
gale-intensity
on
February
11
,
just
24
hours
after
it
peaked
,
and
was
last
noted
early
on
February
12
.


Battering
Aitutaki
with
wind
gusts
in
excess
of
185
km/h
(
115
mph
)
,
Cyclone
Pat
devastated
the
island
.


Approximately
78
percent
of
homes
were
damaged
,
with
72
structures
destroyed
.


The
electrical
grid
was
left
completely
offline
and
supply
of
water
was
largely
lost
.


Agriculture
also
experienced
tremendous
impact
,
with
most
crops
completely
lost
.


Damage
on
Aitutaki
amounted
to
US
$
13.7
million
;
however
,
casualties
were
minimal
with
only
eight
minor
injuries
reported
.


Recovery
efforts
began
immediately
after
the
storm
,
with
the
Red
Cross
and
the
Government
of
New
Zealand
aiding
the
local
government
.


A
reconstruction
plan
was
enacted
by
the
Cook
Islands
within
a
month
and
subsequently
funded
by
New
Zealand
.


Owing
to
its
destructive
effects
,
the
name
``
Pat
''
was
later
retired
and
replaced
with
``
Pili
''
.


The
Whitman
massacre
(
also
known
as
the
Walla
Walla
massacre
and
the
Whitman
Incident
)
was
the
murder
of
Oregon
missionaries
Marcus
Whitman
and
his
wife
Narcissa
,
along
with
eleven
others
,
on
November
30th
,
1847
.


They
were
killed
by
members
of
the
Cayuse
tribe
who
accused
him
of
having
poisoned
200
Cayuse
in
his
medical
care
.


The
incident
began
the
Cayuse
War
.


It
took
place
in
southeastern
Washington
state
near
the
town
of
Walla
Walla
,
Washington
and
was
one
of
the
most
notorious
episodes
in
the
U.S.
settlement
of
the
Pacific
Northwest
.


Whitman
had
helped
lead
the
first
wagon
train
to
cross
Oregon
's
Blue
Mountains
and
reach
the
Columbia
River
via
the
Oregon
Trail
,
and
this
incident
was
the
climax
of
several
years
of
complex
interaction
between
him
and
the
local
Indians
.


The
story
of
the
massacre
shocked
the
United
States
Congress
into
action
concerning
the
future
territorial
status
of
the
Oregon
Country
,
and
the
Oregon
Territory
was
established
on
August
14
,
1848
.


The
killings
are
usually
ascribed
in
part
to
a
clash
of
cultures
and
in
part
to
the
inability
of
Whitman
,
a
physician
,
to
halt
the
spread
of
measles
among
the
Indians
.


The
Cayuse
held
Whitman
responsible
for
subsequent
deaths
.


The
incident
remains
controversial
to
this
day
;
the
Whitmans
are
regarded
by
some
as
pioneer
heroes
,
while
others
see
them
as
white
settlers
who
had
attempted
to
impose
their
religion
on
the
Indians
and
otherwise
intrude
,
even
allegedly
poisoning
them
.


The
South
Thailand
insurgency
(
;
)
is
an
ongoing
conflict
centered
in
southern
Thailand
.


It
originated
in
1948
as
an
ethnic
and
religious
separatist
insurgency
in
the
historical
Malay
Patani
Region
,
made
up
of
the
three
southernmost
provinces
of
Thailand
and
parts
of
a
fourth
,
but
has
become
more
complex
and
increasingly
violent
since
2001
.


The
former
Sultanate
of
Pattani
,
which
included
the
southern
Thai
provinces
of
Pattani
(
Patani
)
,
Yala
(
Jala
)
,
Narathiwat
(
Menara
)
—also
known
as
the
three
Southern
Border
Provinces
(
SBP
)
—as
well
as
neighbouring
parts
of
Songkhla
Province
(
Singgora
)
,
and
the
northeastern
part
of
Malaysia
(
Kelantan
)
,
was
conquered
by
the
Kingdom
of
Siam
in
1785
and
,
except
for
Kelantan
,
has
been
governed
by
Thailand
ever
since
.


although
low-level
separatist
violence
had
occurred
in
the
region
for
decades
,
the
campaign
escalated
after
2001
,
with
a
recrudescence
in
2004
,
and
has
occasionally
spilled
over
into
other
provinces
.


Incidents
blamed
on
southern
insurgents
have
occurred
in
Bangkok
and
Phuket
.


In
July
2005
,
Prime
Minister
Thaksin
Shinawatra
assumed
wide-ranging
emergency
powers
to
deal
with
the
southern
violence
,
but
the
insurgency
escalated
further
.


On
19
September
2006
,
a
military
junta
ousted
Thaksin
Shinawatra
in
a
coup
.


The
junta
implemented
a
major
policy
shift
by
replacing
Thaksin
's
earlier
approach
with
a
campaign
to
win
over
the
``
hearts
and
minds
''
of
the
insurgents
.


Despite
little
progress
in
curbing
the
violence
,
the
junta
declared
that
security
was
improving
and
that
peace
would
come
to
the
region
by
2008
.


By
March
2008
,
however
,
the
death
toll
surpassed
3,000
.


During
the
Democrat-led
government
of
Abhisit
Vejjajiva
,
Foreign
Minister
Kasit
Piromya
noted
a
``
sense
of
optimism
''
and
said
that
he
was
confident
of
bringing
peace
to
the
region
in
2010
.


But
by
the
end
of
2010
insurgency-related
violence
had
increased
,
confounding
the
government
's
optimism
.


Finally
in
March
2011
,
the
government
conceded
that
violence
was
increasing
and
could
not
be
solved
in
a
few
months
.


Local
leaders
have
persistently
demanded
at
least
a
level
of
autonomy
from
Thailand
for
the
Patani
region
and
some
of
the
separatist
insurgent
movements
have
made
a
series
of
demands
for
peace
talks
and
negotiations
.


However
,
these
groups
have
been
largely
sidelined
by
the
Barisan
Revolusi
Nasional-Koordinasi
(
BRN-C
)
,
the
group
currently
spearheading
the
insurgency
.


It
sees
no
reason
for
negotiations
and
is
against
talks
with
other
insurgent
groups
.


The
BRN-C
has
as
its
immediate
aim
to
make
southern
Thailand
ungovernable
and
it
has
largely
been
successful
.


Estimates
of
the
strength
of
the
insurgency
vary
greatly
.


In
2004
General
Pallop
Pinmanee
claimed
that
there
were
only
500
hardcore
jihadists
.


Other
estimates
say
there
as
many
as
15,000
armed
insurgents
.


Around
2004
some
Thai
analysts
believed
that
foreign
Islamic
terrorist
groups
were
infiltrating
the
area
,
and
that
foreign
funds
and
arms
are
being
brought
in
,
though
again
,
such
claims
were
balanced
by
an
equally
large
body
of
opinion
suggesting
this
remains
a
distinctly
local
conflict
.


over
6,500
people
died
and
almost
12,000
were
injured
between
2004
and
2015
in
a
formerly
ethnic
separatist
insurgency
,
which
has
currently
been
taken
over
by
hard-line
jihadis
and
pitted
them
against
both
the
unk
buddhist
minority
and
local
muslims
who
have
a
moderate
approach
or
who
support
the
thai
government
.


The
Hock
Lee
bus
workers
'
strike
began
on
April
23
,
1955
.


The
incident
was
a
result
of
failed
negotiations
between
the
Hock
Lee
Amalgamated
Bus
Company
and
its
bus
workers
.


The
workers
wanted
better
working
conditions
while
the
employers
wanted
to
protect
their
business
interests
.


The
strikes
eventually
escalated
and
resulted
in
a
clash
among
the
Singapore
Bus
Workers
Union
,
Hock
Lee
Employee
's
Union
,
the
Singapore
Chinese
Middle
Schools
Student
Union
and
law
enforcement
on
May
12
,
1955
.


The
event
has
been
commonly
understood
as
a
violent
confrontation
between
colonialists
and
communists
.


The
event
was
however
also
born
out
of
the
conditions
of
colonial
society
as
well
as
being
part
of
a
necessary
modernisation
trajectory
that
Singapore
was
embarking
on
.


The
Battle
of
Lovcha
,
``
or

''
(
today
Lovech
)
,
was
a
battle
of
the
Russo-Turkish
War
(
1877–1878
)
which
occurred
during
the
siege
of
Plevna
.


Russian
forces
successfully
reduced
the
fortress
at
Lovcha
,
which
had
protected
Plevna
's
communication
and
supply
lines
.


In
July
1877
,
shortly
after
the
siege
of
Plevna
began
,
the
garrison
's
commander
,
Osman
Pasha
,
received
15
battalions
of
reinforcements
from
Sofia
.


He
chose
to
use
these
reinforcements
to
fortify
Lovcha
,
which
protected
his
lines
of
support
running
from
Orchanie
to
Plevna
.


After
the
failure
of
the
first
two
attempts
to
storm
the
city
of
Plevna
,
the
Russians
brought
up
significant
reinforcements
,
and
the
investing
army
now
totaled
100,000
.


Intent
on
cutting
Osman
's
communications
and
supply
lines
,
General
Alexander
Imerentinsky
was
sent
out
with
22,703
Russian
troops
to
seize
Lovcha
.


On
September
1
Generals
Alexander
Imerentinsky
,
Mikhail
Skobelev
,
and
Vladimir
Dobrowolski
reached
Lovcha
and
attacked
the
city
.


Fighting
continued
for
the
next
two
days
.


Osman
marched
out
of
Plevna
to
the
relief
of
Lovcha
,
but
on
September
3
,
before
he
could
reach
Lovcha
,
it
fell
to
the
Russians
.


Survivors
of
the
battle
withdrew
into
Plevna
and
were
organized
into
3
battalions
.


After
the
loss
of
Lovcha
,
these
additional
troops
brought
Osman
's
force
up
to
30,000
,
the
largest
it
would
be
during
the
siege
.


The
Russians
settled
on
the
strategy
of
a
complete
investment
of
Plevna
,
and
with
the
loss
of
its
major
supply
route
,
the
fall
of
Plevna
was
inevitable
.


The
Clayton
Tunnel
rail
crash
occurred
on
Sunday
25
August
1861
,
five
miles
from
Brighton
on
the
south
coast
of
England
.


At
the
time
it
was
the
worst
accident
on
the
British
railway
system
.


A
train
ran
into
the
back
of
another
inside
the
tunnel
,
killing
23
and
injuring
176
passengers
.


Three
north-bound
trains
left
Brighton
station
within
a
few
minutes
of
one
another
.


at
the
southern
entrance
to
clayton
tunnel
an
automatic
signal
failed
to
return
to
danger
after
the
first
train
passed
,
allowing
the
second
train
to
follow
it
into
the
tunnel
.


The
signaller
at
the
south
end
of
the
tunnel
belatedly
waved
a
red
flag
in
an
attempt
to
stop
the
second
train
,
but
thought
that
it
had
not
been
seen
.


However
the
driver
of
the
second
train
had
briefly
glimpsed
the
flag
and
stopped
his
train
inside
the
tunnel
.


The
signaller
then
misinterpreted
a
'line
clear
'
telegraph
message
from
the
signal
box
at
the
north
end
of
the
tunnel
as
referring
to
the
second
train
instead
of
the
first
,
and
signalled
the
third
train
into
the
tunnel
.

''
album
.


It
was
his
longest
and
most
successful
tour
to
date
.


It
featured
a
physically
transformed
Springsteen
;
after
two
years
of
bodybuilding
,
the
singer
had
bulked
up
considerably
.


the
tour
was
the
first
since
the
1974
portions
of
the
born
to
run
tours
without
guitarist
steven
van
zandt
,
who
decided
to
go
solo
after
recording
the
album
with
the
group
.


Van
Zandt
,
who
was
replaced
by
Nils
Lofgren
,
would
appear
a
few
times
throughout
the
tour
and
in
some
of
the
music
videos
to
promote
the
album
.


It
was
also
the
first
tour
to
feature
Springsteen
's
future
wife
,
Patti
Scialfa
.


The
tour
started
in
June
1984
and
went
through
the
United
States
and
to
Canada
.


In
March
1985
the
tour
went
to
Australia
,
Japan
and
Europe
.


It
then
headed
back
for
a
second
leg
of
the
U.S.

in
which
Springsteen
and
the
E

Band
played
to
sold-out
professional
football
stadiums

The
tour
finished
in
October
1985
in
Los
Angeles
.


The
tour
grossed
$
80–90
million
overall
.


Of
that
,
$
34
million
came
from

.


Springsteen
also
was
enjoying
a
hit
single
from
the
album
(
there
were
seven
in
total
)
during
any
moment
of
the

,
which
he
did

was
a
men
's
major
golf
championship
and
the
129th
Open

,
held
from
20–23

,
won
his
first
Open
Championship
and
fourth
major
title
,
eight
strokes
ahead
of
runners-up
Thomas
Bjørn
and
Ernie
Els
.


With
the
victory
,
Woods
became
the
youngest
ever
to
win
all
four
major
championships
,
passing
Jack
Nicklaus
by
two
years
.


Woods
became
the
fifth
player
to
complete
the
feat
,
known
as
the
``
career
grand
slam
.
''


In
doing
so
,
he
also
achieved
the
lowest
72-hole
score
in
relation
to
par
at
−19
,
which
was
a
record
for
all
major
championships
for
fifteen
years
,
until
Jason
Day
broke
it
at
the
PGA
Championship
in
2015
at
twenty-under-par
.


Woods
became
the
sixth
to
win
the
U.S.
Open
and
the
Open
Championship
in
the
same
year
,
joining
fellow
Americans
Bobby

It
was
the
first

to
be
telecast
in
high-definition
television
in
any
country
,
being
telecast
in
the
United

Occupy
Berlin
was
a
collaboration
in
Berlin
,
Germany
that
has
included
peaceful
protests
and
demonstrations
against
unregulated
financial
markets
and
other
alleged
social
injustices
.


It
began
as
a
part
of
the
15
October
2011
global
protests
.


The
protest
began
in
solidarity
with
the
Occupy
Wall
Street
protests
in
New
York
,
United
States
.


It
has
established
three
encampments
:
outside
the
church
Parochialkirche
,
in
Boxhagener
Platz
and
the
biggest
one
on
the
Bundespressestrand
.


Occupy
Berlin
cooperates
with
similar
movements
throughout
Germany
,
most
notably
from
Frankfurt
and
Hamburg
.


As
of
June
2012
,
Occupy
Berlin
had
continued
to
engage
in
organized
meetings
,
events
and
actions
.


The
Brinks
Hotel
in
Saigon
,
also
known
as
the
Brink
Bachelor
Officers
Quarters
(
BOQ
)
,
was
bombed
by
the
Viet
Cong
on
the
evening
of
December
24
,
1964
,
during
the
Vietnam
War
.


Two
Viet
Cong
operatives
detonated
a
car
bomb
underneath
the
hotel
,
which
housed
United
States
Army
officers
.


The
explosion
killed
two
Americans
,
an
officer
and
an
NCO
,
and
injured
approximately
60
,
including
military
personnel
and
Vietnamese
civilians
.


The
Viet
Cong
commanders
had
planned
the
venture
with
two
objectives
in
mind
.


First
,
by
attacking
an
American
installation
in
the
center
of
the
heavily
guarded
capital
,
the
Viet
Cong
intended
to
demonstrate
their
ability
to
strike
in
South
Vietnam
should
the
United
States
decide
to
launch
air
raids
against
North
Vietnam
.


Second
,
the
bombing
would
demonstrate
to
the
South
Vietnamese
that
the
Americans
were
vulnerable
and
could
not
be
relied
upon
for
protection
.


The
bombing
prompted
debate
within
the
administration
of
United
States
President
Lyndon
B.
Johnson
.


Most
of
his
advisers
favored
retaliatory
bombing
of
North
Vietnam
and
the
introduction
of
American
combat
troops
,
while
Johnson
preferred
the
existing
strategy
of
training
the
Army
of
the
Republic
of
Vietnam
to
protect
South
Vietnam
from
the
Vietcong
.


In
the
end
,
Johnson
decided
not
to
take
retaliatory
action
.


the
abkhazian
revolution
took
place
in
2014
,
when
president
aleksandr
ankvab
resigned
after
hundreds
of
demonstrators
stormed
his
office
.


After
mass
protests
in
the
capital
Sukhumi
and
the
occupation
of
his
office
on
27
May
,
Ankvab
fled
to
his
hometown
of
Gudauta
and
ultimately
resigned
on
1
June
,
after
previously
denouncing
the
demonstration
as
an
attempted
coup
d'état
.


The
uprising
was
attributed
to
public
anger
with
Ankvab
over
his
perceived
liberal
policy
toward
ethnic
Georgians
in
Abkhazia
,
a
breakaway
republic
with
limited
recognition
.


although
abkhazia
seceded
from
georgia
in
1992
,
the
ankvab
administration
allowed
ethnic
georgians
to
register
as
voters
and
receive
abkhazian
passports
.


The
revolution
led
to
an
early
presidential
election
being
called
in
August
2014
.


Opposition
leader
Raul
Khajimba
was
elected
president
with
a
narrow
majority
of
the
vote
.


The

Protests

)
,
also
known
as
the
8-8-88
Uprisings
,
or
the
People
Power
Uprising
,
the
People
's
Democracy
Movement
and
the
1988
Uprising
,
were
a
series
of
nationwide
protests
,
marches
and
civil
unrest
in
Burma
(
Myanmar
)
that
peaked
in
August
1988
.


Key
events
occurred
on
8
August
1988
and
therefore
it
is
known
as
the
8888
Uprising
.


The
protests
began
as
a
student
movement
and
were
organised
largely
by
university
students
at
the
Rangoon
Arts
and
Sciences
University
and
the
Rangoon
Institute
of
Technology
(
RIT
)
.


since
1962
,
the
burma
socialist
programme
party
had
ruled
the
country
as
a
totalitarian
one-party
state
,
headed
by
general
ne
win
.


Under
the
government
agenda
,
called
the
Burmese
Way
to
Socialism
,
which
involved
economic
isolation
and
strengthening
the
military
,
Burma
became
one
of
the
world
's
most
impoverished
countries
.


Many
firms
in
the
formal
sector
of
the
economy
were
nationalised
,
and
the
government
combined
Soviet-style
central
planning
with
Buddhist
and
traditional
beliefs
.


The
8888
uprising
was
started
by
students
in
Yangon
(
Rangoon
)
on
8
August
1988
.


Student
protests
spread
throughout
the
country
.


Hundreds
of
thousands
of
monks
,
children
,
university
students
,
housewives
,
doctors
and
common
people
protested
against
the
government
.


The
uprising
ended
on
18
September
after
a
bloody
military
coup
by
the
State
Law
and
Order
Restoration
Council
(
SLORC
)
.


Thousands
of
deaths
have
been
attributed
to
the
military
during
this
uprising
,
while
authorities
in
Myanmar
put
the
figure
at
around
350
people
killed
.


During
the
crisis
,
Aung
San
Suu
Kyi
emerged
as
a
national
icon
.


When
the
military
junta
arranged
an
election
in
1990
,
her
party
,
the
National
League
for
Democracy
,
won
81
%
of
the
seats
in
the
government
(
392
out
of
492
)
.


However
,
the
military
junta
refused
to
recognise
the
results
and
continued
ruling
the
country
as
the
State
Law
and
Order
Restoration
Council
.


Aung
San
Suu
Kyi
was
also
put
under
house
arrest
.


the
state
law
and
order
restoration
council
would
be
a
cosmetic
change
from
the
burma
socialist
programme
party
.


Suu
Kyi
's
house
arrest
was
lifted
in
2010
,
when
worldwide
attention
for
her
peaked
again
during
the
making
of
the
biographical
film
``
The
Lady
''
.


on
2
june
1994
,
a
chinook
helicopter
of
the
royal
air
force
(
raf
)
,
serial
number
``
unk
''
,
crashed
on
the
mull
of
kintyre
,
scotland
,
in
foggy
conditions
.


The
crash
resulted
in
the
deaths
of
all
twenty-five
passengers
and
four
crew
on
board
.


Among
the
passengers
were
almost
all
the
United
Kingdom
's
senior
Northern
Ireland
intelligence
experts
.


The
accident
is
the
RAF
's
worst
peacetime
disaster
.


In
1995
,
an
RAF
board
of
inquiry
ruled
that
it
was
impossible
to
establish
the
exact
cause
of
the
accident
.


This
ruling
was
subsequently
overturned
by
two
senior
reviewing
officers
,
who
stated
the
pilots
were
guilty
of
gross
negligence
for
flying
too
fast
and
too
low
in
thick
fog
.


This
finding
proved
to
be
controversial
,
especially
in
light
of
irregularities
and
technical
issues
surrounding
the
then-new
Chinook
HC.2
variant
which
were
uncovered
.


A
Parliamentary
inquiry
conducted
in
2001
found
the
previous
verdict
of
gross
negligence
on
the
part
of
the
crew
to
be
'unjustified
'
.


In
2011
,
an
independent
review
of
the
crash
cleared
the
crew
of
negligence
.

Most
of
the
crash
sequence
,
which
occurred
in

of
several
thousand
spectators
,
was
caught
on
video
.


The
cause
of
the
crash
has
been
the
source
of
major
controversy
.


This
particular
flight
was
not
only
the
A320
's
first
passenger
flight
(
most
of
those
on-board
were
journalists
and
raffle
winners
)
,
but
it
was
also
the
first
public
demonstration
of
any
civilian
fly-by-wire

.


The

,
was
supposed
to
take
place
at

end
of
the
runway
(
which
had
not
been
shown
on
the
airport
map
given
to
the
pilots
)
,
and
crashed
.


All
the
passengers
survived
the
initial
impact
,
but
a
woman
and
two
children
died
from
smoke
inhalation
before
they
were
able
to
escape
.


Official
reports
concluded
that
the
pilots
flew
too
low
,
too
slow
,
failed
to
see
the
forest
and
accidentally
flew
into
it
.


The
captain
,
Michel
Asseline
,
disputed
the
report
and
claimed
an
error
in
the
fly-by-wire
computer
prevented
him
from
applying
thrust
and
pulling
up
.


In
the
aftermath
of
the
crash
,
there
were
allegations
that
investigators
had
tampered
with
evidence
,
specifically
the
aircraft
's
flight
recorders
(
``
black
boxes
''
)
.


This
was
the
first
fatal
crash
of
an
A320
.


23
June
2009
Makin
airstrike
was
an
attack
launched
by
United
States
drones
on
a
funeral
procession
in
the
city
of
Makin
in
South
Waziristan
,
Pakistan
.


The
attack
targeted
a
funeral
procession
of
militants
killed
earlier
in
the
day
in
a
prior
similar
strike
by
drones
.


About
60
people
were
reported
killed
in
what
is
considered
perhaps
the
deadliest
strike
since
the
drone
attacks
started
.


Other
sources
claimed
up
to
83
people
were
dead
.


There
were
reports
that
Baitullah
Mehsud
was
in
the
area
but
escaped
unhurt
while
his
deputy
Qari
Hussain
was
killed
,
although
this
has
been
disputed
.


Hussain
later
phoned
reporters
to
prove
he
was
still
alive
.


The
drones
fired
missiles
when
Sangeen
Khan
,
an
Afghan
commander
belonging
to
Tehrik-i-Taliban
Pakistan
,
was
holding
a
meeting
soon
after
the
funeral
of
an
associate
of
Baitullah
Mehsud
.


The
Battle
of
Sakarya
(
)
,
also
known
as
the
Battle
of
the
Sangarios
(
)
,
was
an
important
engagement
in
the
Greco-Turkish
War
(
1919–1922
)
,
the
western
front
of
the
Turkish
War
of
Independence
.


The
battle
went
on
for
21
days
from
August
23
to
September
13
,
1921
,
close
to
the
banks
of
the
Sakarya
River
in
the
immediate
vicinity
of
Polatlı
,
which
is
today
a
district
of
the
Ankara
Province
.


The
battle
line
stretched
over
62
miles
(
100
km
)
.


It
is
also
known
as
the
Officers
'
Battle
(
)
in
Turkey
because
of
the
unusually
high
casualty
rate
(
70–80
%
)
among
the
officers
.


Later
,
it
was
also
called
``
Melhâme-i
Kübrâ
''
(
equivalent
to
Armageddon
)
by
Atatürk
.


The
Battle
of
Sakarya
is
considered
as
the
turning
point
of
the
Turkish
War
of
Independence
.


A
Turkish
observer
,
writer
and
literary
critic
İsmail
Habip
Sevük
,
later
described
the
importance
of
the
battle
with
the
words
,
``
the
retreat
that
started
in
Vienna
on
13
September
1683
stopped
238
years
later

The
Reality
Tour
is
the
second
concert
tour
by
American
recording
artist
Jessica
Simpson
.


Predominately
visiting
the
United
States
,
the
tour
supported
Simpson
's
third
studio
album
,
``
In
This
Skin
''
.


According
to
the
singer
,
the
title
derives
from
her
recent
success
on
the
reality
TV
series
,
``
''
,
while
showcasing
her
music
on
a
natural
level
.


The
excursion
began
in
New
Orleans
in
June
.


It
traveled
the
country
over
the
next
two
months
,
visiting
over
30
cities
,
ending
August
1
in
Paso
Robles
.


Despite
early
reports
of
poor
ticket
sales
,
Simpson
's
tour
became
one
of
the
biggest
summer
tours
in
North
America
,
prompting
the
singer
to
add
an
additional
leg
for
the
U.S.
Eleven
concerts
were
planned
for
September
and
October
.


To
date
,
the
tour
serves
as
Simpson
's
last
major
concert
tour
.


The
tour
ranked
87th
on
Pollstar
's
``
Top
100
Tours
2004
''
,
earning
over
seven
million
dollars

investigation
body
,
the
Ministry
of

determined
the
primary
cause
of

,
a
multiple-vehicle
collision
occurred
on
the

England
.


The
crash
involved
dozens
of
cars
and
articulated
lorries
,
and
a
large
fireball
ensued
.


Seven
people
were
killed
and
51
others
were
injured
,
making
the
pile-up
the
deadliest
on
a
British
motorway
since
13

–
died
in

was
operating
a
fireworks
display
for
Guy
Fawkes
Night
at
Taunton
Rugby
Club
's
ground
,
which
is
adjacent
to
the
motorway
,
was
charged
with
seven
counts
of
manslaughter
.


In
January
2013
,
the
manslaughter
charges
were
dropped
and
instead
he
faced
a
single
charge
under
health
and
safety
laws
of
failing
to
ensure
the
safety
of
others
.


In
December
2013
he
was
found
not
guilty
of
the
charge
.


In
April
2014
,
the
West
Somerset
coroner
concluded
that
the
accident
was
caused
by
dense
fog
,
and
that
smoke
from
fireworks
may
have
been
a
contributory
factor
,
but
was
not
the
prime
cause
of
the
incident
.


The
Račak
massacre
(

Kosovo
Albanians
that
took
place
in
the
village
of
Račak
(
)
in
central
Kosovo
in
January
1999
.


The
killings
were
perpetrated
by
Serbian
security
forces
.


The
Serbian
government
refused
to
let
a
war
crimes
prosecutor
visit
the
site
,
and
maintained
that
the
casualties
were
all
members
of
the
rebel
Kosovo
Liberation
Army
killed
in
combat
with
state
security
forces
.


The
killings
were
a
major
factor
in
NATO
deciding
to
use
force
against
the
Federal
Republic
of
Yugoslavia
.


The
killings
were
investigated
by
two
separate
forensic
teams
,
the
first
a
joint
Yugoslav
and
Belarusian
team
and
the
second
a
Finnish
team
.


The
first
team
's
report
,
which
was
commissioned
by
the
Yugoslav
government
,
concluded
that
those
killed
,
who
included
a
woman
and
12-year-old
child
,
were
all
separatist
guerrillas
and
not
civilians
.


Bill
Clinton
,
then
president
of
the
United

,
condemned
the
massacre
of
the
civilians
,
calling
it
a
deliberate
and
indiscriminate
act
of
murder

has
around
4,000
prisoners
,
has
witnessed
a
number

The
Second
Congo
War
(
also
known
as
the
Great
War
of
Africa
or
the
Great
African
War
,
and
sometimes
referred
to
as
the
African
World
War
)
began
in
the
Democratic
Republic
of
the
Congo
in
August
1998
,
little
more
than
a
year
after
the
First
Congo
War
,
and
involved
some
of
the
same
issues
.


The
war
officially
ended
in
July
2003
,
when
the
Transitional
Government
of
the
Democratic
Republic
of
the
Congo
took
power
.


although
a
peace
agreement
was
signed
in
2002
,
violence
has
continued
in
many
regions
of
the
country
,
especially
in
the
east
.


hostilities
have
continued
since
the
ongoing
lord
's
resistance
army
insurgency
,
and
the
kivu
and
ituri
conflicts
.


Ultimately
,
nine
African
countries
and
around
twenty-five
armed
groups
became
involved
in
the
war
.


By
2008
,
the
war
and
its
aftermath
had
caused
5.4
million
deaths
,
principally
through
disease
and
starvation
,
making
the
Second
Congo
War
the
deadliest
conflict
worldwide
since
World
War
II
.


Another
2
million
were
displaced
from
their
homes
or
sought
asylum
in
neighboring
countries
.


Despite
a
formal
end
to
the
war
in
July
2003
and
an
agreement
by
the
former
belligerents
to
create
a
government
of
national
unity
,
1,000
people
died
daily
in
2004
from
easily
preventable
cases
of
malnutrition
and
disease
.


The
war
was
driven
by
(
as
the
conflicts
afterwards
have
been
)
the
trade
in
conflict
minerals
,
among
other
things
.


Euromaidan
(
;
,
,
,
literally
'Euro
[
pean
]
Square
'
)
was
a
wave
of
demonstrations
and
civil
unrest
in
Ukraine
,
which
began
on
the
night
of
21
November
2013
with
public
protests
in
Maidan
Nezalezhnosti
(
Independence
Square
)
in
Kiev
.


The
protests
were
sparked
by
the
Ukrainian
government
's
decision
to
suspend
the
signing
of
an
association
agreement
with
the
European
Union
,
instead
choosing
closer
ties
to
Russia
and
the
Eurasian
Economic
Union
.


The
scope
of
the
protests
soon
widened
,
with
calls
for
the
resignation
of
President
Viktor
Yanukovych
and
his
government
.


The
protests
were
fueled
by
the
perception
of
``
widespread
government
corruption
''
,
``
abuse
of
power
''
,
and
``
violation
of
human
rights
in
Ukraine
''
.


Transparency
International
named
President
Yanukovych
as
the
top
example
of
corruption
in
the
world
.


The
situation
escalated
after
the
violent
dispersal
of
protesters
on
30
November
,
leading
to
many
more
protesters
joining
.


The
protests
led
to
the
2014
Ukrainian
revolution
.


During
the
Euromaidan
,
there
were
protests
and
clashes
with
police
throughout
Ukraine
,
especially
at
the
Maidan
(
central
square
)
in
Kiev
,
which
was
occupied
and
barricaded
by
protesters
,
along
with
some
administrative
buildings
,
including
Kiev
City
State
Administration
.


On
8
December
the
crowd
toppled
a
Lenin
statue
nearby
.


Protests
and
clashes
increased
in
January
,
after
the
Ukrainian
parliament
passed
a
group
of
anti-protest
laws
.


Protesters
occupied
government
buildings
in
many
regions
of
Ukraine
.


The
protests
climaxed
in
mid-February
.


Riot
police
advanced
towards
Maidan
and
clashed
with
protesters
but
did
not
fully
occupy
it
.


Police
and
activists
fired
live
and
rubber
ammunition
at
multiple
locations
in
Kiev
.


There
was
fierce
fighting
in
Kiev
on
18–20
February
,
(
see
List
of
people
killed
during
Euromaidan
)
.


as
a
result
of
these
events
,
the
agreement
on
settlement
of
political
crisis
in
ukraine
was
signed
on
21
february
2014
by
the
president
of
ukraine
viktor
yanukovych
and
the
leaders
of
the
parliamentary
opposition
(
vitaly
klitschko
,
arseny
yatsenyuk
,
oleh
tyahnybok
)
under
the
mediation
of
the
european
union
and
the
russian
federation
.


The
signing
was
witnessed
by
the
Foreign
Ministers
of
Germany
and
Poland
,
Frank-Walter
Steinmeier
,
Radosław
Sikorski
,
respectively
,
and
the
Director
of
the
Continental
Europe
Department
of
the
French
Foreign
Ministry
,
Eric
Fournier
.


Vladimir
Lukin
,
representing
Russia
,
refused
to
sign
the
agreement
.


Shortly
after
the
agreement
was
signed
,
Yanukovych
and
other
high
government
officials
fled
the
country
.


Protesters
gained
control
of
the
presidential
administration
and
Yanukovych
's
private
estate
.


Afterwards
,
the
parliament
removed
Yanukovych
from
office
,
replaced
the
government
with
Oleksandr
Turchynov
,
and
ordered
that
former
Prime
Minister
Yulia
Tymoshenko
be
released
from
prison
.


Events
in
Kiev
were
soon
followed
by
the
Crimean
crisis
and
pro-Russian
unrest
in
Eastern
Ukraine
.


despite
the
ousting
of
yanukovych
,
the
installation
of
a
new
government
,
and
the
adoption
of
the
unk
union
association
agreement
's
political
provisions
,
the
protests
have
sustained
pressure
on
the
government
to
reject
russian
influence
in
ukraine
.


The
Ecuadorian–Peruvian
War
,
known
locally
as
the
War
of
'41
(
)
,
was
a
South
American
border
war
fought
between
5–31
July
1941
.


It
was
the
first
of
three
military
conflicts
between
Ecuador
and
Peru
during
the
20th
century
.


During
the
war
,
Peru
occupied
the
western
Ecuadorian
province
of
El
Oro
and
parts
of
the
Andean
province
of
Loja
.


although
the
unk
war
occurred
during
world
war
ii
,
it
was
not
part
of
the
conflict
;
ecuador
and
peru
were
neither
affiliated
with
nor
supported
by
the
allies
or
the
axis
.


A
ceasefire
agreement
between
the
two
countries
came
into
effect
on
31
July
1941
.


Both
countries
signed
the
Rio
Protocol
on
29
January
1942
,
and
Peruvian
forces
subsequently
withdrew
.


The
enmity
over
the
territorial
dispute
continued
after
1942
and
concluded
following
the
Cenepa
War
of
1995
and
the
signing
of
the
Brasilia
Presidential
Act
agreement
in
October
1998
.


The
Indo-Pakistani
War
of
1971
was
a
military
confrontation
between
India
and
Pakistan
that
occurred
during
the
liberation
war
in
East
Pakistan
from
3
December
1971
to
the
fall
of
Dacca
(
Dhaka
)
on
16
December
1971
.


The
war
began
with
preemptive
aerial
strikes
on
11
Indian
air
stations
,
which
led
to
the
commencement
of
hostilities
with
Pakistan
and
Indian
entry
into
the
war
of
independence
in
East
Pakistan
on
the
side
of
Bengali
nationalist
forces
.


Lasting
just
13
days
,
it
is
one
of
the
shortest
wars
in
history
.


During
the
war
,
Indian
and
Pakistani
militaries
simultaneously
clashed
on
the
eastern
and
western
fronts
;
the
war
ended
after
the
Eastern
Command
of
the
Pakistan
military
signed
the
Instrument
of
Surrender
on
16
December
1971
in
Dhaka
,
marking
the
formation
of
East
Pakistan
as
the
new
nation
of
Bangladesh
.


Officially
,
East
Pakistan
had
earlier
called
for
its
secession
from
the
unity
of
Pakistan
on
26
March
1971
.


approximately
90,000
to
93,000
pakistani
servicemen
were
taken
prisoner
by
the
indian
army
,
which
included
unk
to
81,000
uniformed
personnel
of
the
pakistan
armed
forces
,
including
some
bengali
soldiers
who
had
remained
loyal
to
pakistan
.


The
remaining
10,324
to
12,500
prisoners
were
civilians
,
either
family
members
of
the
military
personnel
or
collaborators
(
razakars
)
.


It
is
estimated
that
between
300,000
and
3,000,000
civilians
were
killed
in
Bangladesh
.


As
a
result
of
the
conflict
,
a
further
eight
to
ten
million
people
fled
the
country
to
seek
refuge
in
India
.


During
the
1971
Bangladesh
war
for
independence
,
members
of
the
Pakistani
military
and
supporting
Islamist
militias
called
the
Razakars
raped
between
200,000
and
400,000
Bangladeshi
women
and
girls
in
a
systematic
campaign
of
genocidal
rape
.


The
Polish–Soviet
War
(
14
February
1919
–
18
March
1921
)
was
fought
by
the
Second
Polish
Republic
,
the
Ukrainian
People
's
Republic
and
the
proto-Soviet
Union
(
Soviet
Russia
and
Soviet
Ukraine
)
over
a
region
comparable
to
today
's
westernmost
Ukraine
and
parts
of
modern
Belarus
.


Poland
's
Chief
of
State
,
Józef
Piłsudski
,
felt
the
time
was
right
to
expand
Polish
borders
as
far
east
as
feasible
,
to
be
followed
by
a
Polish-led
``
Intermarium
''
federation
of
Central
and
Eastern
European
states
,
as
a
bulwark
against
the
re-emergence
of
German
and
Russian
imperialism
.


Vladimir
Lenin
saw
Poland
as
the
bridge
the
Red
Army
had
to
cross
to
assist
other
Communist
movements
and
bring
about
more
European
revolutions
.


By
1919
,
Polish
forces
had
taken
control
of
much
of
Western
Ukraine
,
emerging
victorious
from
the
Polish–Ukrainian
War
.


The
West
Ukrainian
People
's
Republic
,
led
by
Yevhen
Petrushevych
,
had
tried
to
create
a
Ukrainian
state
on
territories
to
which
both
Poles
and
Ukrainians
laid
claim
.


In
the
Russian
part
of
Ukraine
Symon
Petliura
tried
to
defend
and
strengthen
the
Ukrainian
People
's
Republic
but
as
the
Bolsheviks
began
to
win
the
Russian
Civil
War
,
they
started
to
advance
westward
towards
the
disputed
Ukrainian
territories
,
causing
Petliura
's
forces
to
retreat
to
Podolia
.


By
the
end
of
1919
,
a
clear
front
had
formed
as
Petliura
decided
to
ally
with
Piłsudski
.


Border
skirmishes
escalated
following
Piłsudski
's
Kiev
Offensive
in
April
1920
.


The
Polish
offensive
was
met
by
a
successful
Red
Army
counter-attack
.


The
Soviet
operation
pushed
the
Polish
forces
back
westward
all
the
way
to
the
Polish
capital
,
Warsaw
,
while
the
Directorate
of
Ukraine
fled
to
Western
Europe
.


Western
fears
of
Soviet
troops
arriving
at
the
German
frontiers
increased
the
interest
of
Western
powers
in
the
war
.


In
mid-summer
,
the
fall
of
Warsaw
seemed
certain
but
in
mid-August
,
the
tide
had
turned
again
,
as
the
Polish
forces
achieved
an
unexpected
and
decisive
victory
at
the
Battle
of
Warsaw
.


In
the
wake
of
the
Polish
advance
eastward
,
the
Soviets
sued
for
peace
and
the
war
ended
with
a
cease-fire
in
October
1920
.


The
Peace
of
Riga
was
signed
on
18
March
1921
,
dividing
the
disputed
territories
between
Poland
and
Soviet
Russia
.


The
war
largely
determined
the
Soviet–Polish
border
for
the
Interbellum
.


Poland
gained
a
territory
of
around
200
kilometers
east
of
its
former
border
,
the
Curzon
Line
,
which
had
been
defined
by
an
international
commission
after
World
War
I
.


much
of
the
territory
allocated
to
poland
in
the
treaty
of
riga
became
part
of
the
soviet
union
after
world
war
ii
,
when
the
common
border
was
re-defined
by
the
allied
powers
in
close
accordance
with
the
curzon
line
.


The
First
Liberian
Civil
War
was
an
internal
conflict
in
Liberia
from
1989
until
1997
.


The
conflict
killed
about
250,000
people
and
eventually
led
to
the
involvement
of
the
Economic
Community
of
West
African
States
(
ECOWAS
)
and
of
the
United
Nations
.


The
peace
did
not
last
long
,
and
in
1999
the
Second
Liberian
Civil
War
broke
out
.


Samuel
Doe
had
led
a
coup
d'état
that
overthrew
the
elected
government
in
1980
,
and
in
1985
held
elections
that
were
widely
considered
fraudulent
.


There
had
been
one
unsuccessful
coup
by
a
former
military
leader
.


In
December
1989
,
former
government
minister
Charles
Taylor
moved
into
the
country
from
neighboring
Ivory
Coast
to
start
an
uprising
meant
to
topple
the
Doe
government
.


Taylor
's
forces
,
the
National
Patriotic
Front
of
Liberia
(
NPFL
)
battled
against
Prince
Johnson
's
rebel
group
,
the
Independent
National
Patriotic
Front
of
Liberia
(
INPFL
)
–
a
faction
of
NPFL
–
for
control
in
Monrovia
.


In
1990
,
Johnson
seized
the
capital
of
Monrovia
and
executed
Doe
.


Peace
negotiations
and
foreign
involvement
led
to
a
ceasefire
in
1995
that
was
broken
the
next
year
before
a
final
peace
agreement
and
new
national
elections
were
held
in
1997
.


Taylor
was
elected
President
of
Liberia
in
July
1997
.


The
Montenegrin–Ottoman
War
(
,
``
Montenegrin-Turkish
War
''
)
,
also
known
in
Montenegro
as
the
Great
War
(
Velji
rat
/
Вељи
рат
)
,
was
fought
between
the
Principality
of
Montenegro
and
the
Ottoman
Empire
between
1876
and
1878
.


The
war
ended
with
Montenegrin
victory
.


Six
major
and
27
smaller
battles
were
fought
,
among
which
was
the
crucial
Battle
of
Vučji
Do
.


A
rebellion
in
nearby
Herzegovina
sparked
a
series
of
rebellions
and
uprisings
against
the
Ottomans
in
Europe
.


Montenegro
and
Serbia
agreed
to
declare
a
war
on
the
Ottomans
on
18
June
1876
.


The
Montenegrins
allied
themselves
with
Herzegovians
.


One
battle
that
was
crucial
to
Montenegro
's
victory
in
the
war
was
the
Battle
of
Vučji
Do
.


In
1877
,
Montenegrins
fought
heavy
battles
along
the
borders
of
Herzegovina
and
Albania
.


Prince
Nicholas
took
the
initiative
and
counterattacked
the
Ottoman
forces
that
were
coming
from
the
north
,
south
and
west
.


He
conquered
Nikšić
(
24
September
1877
)
,
Bar
(
10
January
1878
)
,
Ulcinj
(
20
January
1878
)
,
Grmožur
(
26
January
1878
)
and
Vranjina
and
Lesendro
(
30
January
1878
)
.


The
war
ended
when
the
Ottomans
signed
a
truce
with
the
Montenegrins
at
Edirne
on
13
January
1878
.


The
advancement
of
Russian
forces
toward
the
Ottomans
forced
the
Ottomans
to
sign
a
peace
treaty
on
3
March
1878
,
recognising
the
independence
of
Montenegro
,
as
well
as
Romania
and
Serbia
,
and
also
increased
Montenegro
's
territory
from
4,405
km²
to
9,475
km²
.


Montenegro
also
gained
the
towns
of
Nikšić
,
Kolašin
,
Spuž
,
Podgorica
,
Žabljak
,
Bar
,
as
well
as
access
to
the
sea
.


Hurricane
Mitch
's
meteorological
history
began
with
its
origins
over
Africa
as
a
tropical
wave
and
lasted
until
its
dissipation
as
an
extratropical
cyclone
north
of
the
United
Kingdom
.


Tropical
Depression
Thirteen
formed
on
October
22
,
1998
,
over
the
southwestern
Caribbean
Sea
from
a
tropical
wave
that
exited
Africa
on
October
10
.


it
executed
a
small
loop
,
and
while
doing
so
intensified
into
tropical
storm
mitch
.


A
weakness
in
a
ridge
allowed
the
storm
to
track
slowly
to
the
north
.


After
becoming
disorganized
due
to
wind
shear
from
a
nearby
upper-level
low
,
Mitch
quickly
intensified
in
response
to
improving
conditions
which
included
warm
waters
and
good
outflow
.


It
became
a
hurricane
on
October
24
and
developed
an
eye
.


After
turning
to
the
west
,
Mitch
rapidly
intensified
,
first
into
a
major
hurricane
on
October
25
and
then
into
a
Category
5
on
the
Saffir-Simpson
Hurricane
Scale
the
next
day
.


at
peak
intensity
,
mitch
maintained
maximum
sustained
winds
of
180
mph
(
285
km/h
)
while
off
the
northern
coast
of
honduras
.


Hurricane
Hunters
reported
a
minimum
barometric
pressure
of
,
which
at
the
time
was
the
lowest
in
the
month
of
October
and
tied
for
the
fourth
lowest
for
any
Atlantic
hurricane
.


Initially
,
the
National
Hurricane
Center
(
NHC
)
and
various
tropical
cyclone
forecast
models
anticipated
a
turn
to
the
north
,
threatening
the
Yucatán
Peninsula
.


Instead
,
Mitch
turned
to
the
south
due
to
a
ridge
that
was
not
observed
while
the
storm
was
active
.


Land
interaction
imparted
weakening
,
and
the
hurricane
made
landfall
on
Honduras
on
October
29
with
winds
of
80
mph
(
130
km/h
)
.


Turning
westward
,
Mitch
slowly
weakened
over
land
and
maintained
deep
convection
over
adjacent
waters
.


After
moving
across
mountainous
terrain
in
Central
America
,
the
surface
circulation
of
Mitch
dissipated
on
November
1
.


The
next
day
,
the
remnants
reached
the
Gulf
of
Mexico
and
reorganized
into
a
tropical
storm
on
November
3
.


Mitch
accelerated
to
the
northeast
ahead
of
a
cold
front
,
moving
across
the
Yucatán
Peninsula
before
striking
southwestern
Florida
on
November
5
.


Shortly
thereafter
,
the
storm
became
an
extratropical
cyclone
,
which
was
tracked
by
the
NHC
until
November
9
.


The
Hok
Kolorob
Movement
(
Bengali
:
হোক
কলরব
আন্দোলন
)
or
the
2014
Jadavpur
University
student
protest
,
was
a
four-month
long
series
of
protests
by
the
students
of
Jadavpur
University
in
Kolkata
,
India
that
began
on
3
September
2014
.


The
term
``
Hok
Kolorob
''
(
literally
,
``
let
there
be
polyphony
''
,
Bengali
:
হোক
কলরব
)
was
originally
the
title
of
a
song
by
Bangladeshi
singer
Arnob
and
began
to
be
used
as
a
hashtag
on
Facebook
.


On
16
September
2014
,
peaceful
demonstrations
by
students
took
place
in
front
of
the
administrative
building
of
the
University
,
demanding
an
investigation
into
the
molestation
of
a
female
student
in
campus
.


Following
several
unsuccessful
attempts
at
dialogue
with
the
authorities
,
the
students
gheraoed
some
personnel
of
the
University
authority
,
including
the
Vice-Chancellor
,
Abhijit
Chakrabarti
.


The
Vice-Chancellor
called
the
police
.


The
subsequent
police
brutality
unleashed
upon
the
students
in
the
early
hours
of
17
September
triggered
a
wave
of
protests
by
students
and
teachers
.


Criticisms
of
the
police
brutality
included
that
police
used
baton
charge
on
a
peaceful
demonstration
,
that
female
students
were
manhandled
and
molested
by
male
police
officers
,
and
that
several
men
not
in
uniform
attacked
the
students
.


The
police
maintain
that
there
were
plainclothesmen
among
their
ranks
while
the
students
insist
that
these
were
Trinamool
Congress
(
the
ruling
party
of
the
state
of
West
Bengal
)
cadres
.


The
official
position
of
the
Calcutta
Police
is
that
``
minimum
lawful
force
''
was
applied
to
escort
the
Vice-Chancellor
and
other
members
of
the
committee
out
of
the
University
.


Demonstrations
showing
solidarity
with
the
students
started
in
Kolkata
and
across
India
,
including
in
Delhi
,
Mumbai
,
Hyderabad
and
Bengaluru
.


Protest
marches
in
Kolkata
had
progressively
increasing
turnout
,
culminating
in
a
rally
on
20
September
,
at
the
end
of
which
a
delegation
of
students
met
the
Governor
of
West
Bengal
,
Keshari
Nath
Tripathi
.


Estimates
of
participants
in
the
rally
fluctuate
between
30000
and
over
100000
people
.


The
protests
have
been
marked
with
a
strong
cultural
flavour
:
students
have
been
singing
,
dancing
and
arranging
diverse
cultural
manifestations
throughout
the
days
while
the
protests
ensue
.


The
protests
have
a
large
oeuvre
of
posters
,
graffiti
,
poems
,
songs
,
slogans
,
street
plays
and
performances
dotting
the
University
campus
and
the
streets
of
Kolkata
.


This
has
led
the
Trinamool
Congress
to
link
this
protest
to
the
student
movements
of
the
1970s
.


It
is
one
of
the
first
movements
in
India
to
significantly
employ
social
media
and
internet
activism
for
coordination
and
dissemination
.

the
vietnam
war
(
)
,
also
known
as
the
second
indochina
war
,
and
in
vietnam
as
the
resistance
war
against
america
(
)
or
simply
the
american
war
,
was
a
conflict
in
vietnam
,
laos
,
and
cambodia
from
1
november
1955
to
the
fall
of
saigon
on
30
april
1975
.


It
was
the
second
of
the
Indochina
Wars
and
was
officially
fought
between
North
Vietnam
and
South
Vietnam
.


North
Vietnam
was
supported
by
the
Soviet
Union
,
China
,
and
other
communist
allies
;
South
Vietnam
was
supported
by
the
United
States
,
South
Korea
,
the
Philippines
,
Australia
,
Thailand
and
other
anti-communist
allies
.


The
war
,
considered
a
Cold
War-era
proxy
war
by
some
,
lasted
19
years
,
with
direct
U.S.
involvement
ending
in
1973
,
and
included
the
Laotian
Civil
War
and
the
Cambodian
Civil
War
,
resulting
in
all
three
countries
becoming
communist
in
1975
.


The
conflict
emerged
from
the
First
Indochina
War
against
the
communist-led
Viet
Minh
.


Most
of
the
funding
for
the
French
war
effort
was
provided
by
the
U.S.
After
the
French
quit
Indochina
in
1954
,
the
US
assumed
financial
and
military
support
for
the
South
Vietnamese
state
.


The
Việt
Cộng
,
also
known
as
or
``
NLF
''
(
the
National
Liberation
Front
)
,
a
South
Vietnamese
common
front
under
the
direction
of
North
Vietnam
,
initiated
a
guerrilla
war
in
the
south
.


North
Vietnam
had
also
entered
Laos
in
the
mid-1950s
in
support
of
insurgents
,
setting
up
the
Ho
Chi
Minh
trail
to
supply
and
reinforce
the
Việt
Cộng
and
increased
in
1960
.


U.S.
involvement
escalated
under
President
John
F.
Kennedy
through
the
MAAG
program
from
just
under
a
thousand
in
1959
to
16,000
in
1963
.


By
1963
,
the
North
Vietnamese
had
sent
40,000
soldiers
to
fight
in
South
Vietnam
.


North
Vietnam
was
heavily
backed
by
the
People
's
Republic
of
China
,
which
in
addition
to
supplying
arms
as
the
USSR
did
,
also
sent
hundreds
of
thousands
of
PLA
servicemen
to
North
Vietnam
to
serve
in
support
roles
.


By
1964
,
there
were
23,000
US
advisors
in
South
Vietnam
during
the
Gulf
of
Tonkin
incident
,
in
which
a
U.S.
destroyer
was
alleged
to
have
clashed
with
North
Vietnamese
fast
attack
craft
.


In
response
,
the
Gulf
of
Tonkin
Resolution
gave
President
Lyndon
B.
Johnson
broad
authorization
to
increase
U.S.
military
presence
,
deploying
ground
combat
units
for
the
first
time
and
increasing
troop
levels
to
184,000
.


Past
this
point
,
the
People
's
Army
of
Vietnam
(
known
also
as
the
NVA
)
engaged
in
more
conventional
warfare
with
US
and
South
Vietnamese
forces
.


Every
year
onward
there
was
significant
build-up
of
US
forces
despite
little
progress
,
with
Robert
McNamara
one
of
the
principal
architects
of
the
war
,
expressing
doubts
of
victory
by
the
end
of
1966
.


U.S.
and
South
Vietnam
forces
relied
on
air
superiority
and
overwhelming
firepower
to
conduct
search
and
destroy
operations
,
involving
ground
forces
,
artillery
,
and
airstrikes
.


The
U.S.
also
conducted
a
large-scale
strategic
bombing
campaign
against
North
Vietnam
and
Laos
.


The
Tet
Offensive
of
1968
showed
the
lack
of
progress
with
these
doctrines
as
the
NLF
and
PAVN
mounted
large-scale
urban
offensives
throughout
1968
,
turning
US
domestic
support
against
the
war
.


The
Army
of
the
Republic
of
Vietnam
(
ARVN
)
expanded
following
a
period
of
neglect
after
Tet
,
modeled
on
US
doctrine
.


The
NLF
sustained
heavy
losses
during
the
Tet
Offensive
,
losing
over
half
its
strength
in
a
matter
of
months
,
which
combined
with
subsequent
U.S.-ARVN
operations
in
the
rest
of
1968
,
nearly
wiped
out
the
southern
insurgency
.


The
CIA
's
Phoenix
Program
further
degraded
the
NLF
's
membership
and
capabilities
.


By
the
end
of
the
year
,
the
NLF
insurgents
held
almost
no
territory
in
South
Vietnam
,
and
their
recruitment
dropped
by
over
80
%
in
1969
,
signifying
a
drastic
reduction
in
guerrilla
operations
and
necessitating
increased
use
of
NVA
regulars
from
the
north
.


In
1969
,
North
Vietnam
declared
a
Provisional
Revolutionary
Government
in
South
Vietnam
in
an
attempt
to
give
the
reduced
NLF
a
more
international
stature
,
but
the
southern
guerrillas
from
then
on
were
sidelined
as
PAVN
forces
begun
more
conventional
Combined
arms
warfare
.


Operations
crossed
national
borders
:
Laos
was
invaded
by
North
Vietnam
early
on
while
Cambodia
was
used
by
North
Vietnam
as
a
supply
route
starting
in
1967
;
the
route
through
Cambodia
began
to
be
bombed
by
the
U.S.
in
1969
,
while
the
Laos
route
had
been
heavily
bombed
since
1964
.


the
deposition
of
the
monarch
norodom
sihanouk
by
the
cambodian
national
assembly
resulted
in
a
pavn
invasion
of
the
country
at
the
request
of
the
khmer
rouge
,
escalating
the
cambodian
civil
war
and
resulting
in
a
unk
unk
.


After
1968
,
Nixon
's
policy
of
``
Vietnamization
''
,
saw
the
conflict
fought
by
an
expanded
ARVN
with
U.S.
forces
sidelined
and
increasingly
demoralized
by
domestic
opposition
and
reduced
recruitment
.


U.S.
ground
forces
withdrew
by
late
1971
,
and
U.S.
involvement
became
limited
to
air
support
,
artillery
support
,
advisers
,
and
materiel
shipments
.


The
ARVN
,
buttressed
by
said
U.S.
support
,
stopped
the
largest
and
first
mechanized
PAVN
offensive
to
date
during
the
Easter
Offensive
of
1972
,
resulting
in
mutually
heavy
casualties
,
but
failed
to
recapture
all
territory
,
leaving
its
military
situation
difficult
.


The
Paris
Peace
Accords
saw
all
US
forces
withdrawn
and
intervention
prohibited
by
the
US
Congress
on
15
August
1973
as
a
result
of
the
Case–Church
Amendment
.


The
Peace
Accords
were
broken
almost
immediately
,
and
fighting
continued
for
four
years
following
the
withdrawal
of
U.S.
ground
forces
and
two
years
following
the
withdrawal
of
the
remaining
U.S.
forces
,
though
U.S.
material
support
continued
at
a
much
reduced
rate
.


The
three-year
period
of
1972
to
1974
saw
heavy
fighting
and
constituted
the
war
's
bloodiest
years
for
the
ARVN
.


The
1975
Spring
Offensive
culminated
in
the
capture
of
Saigon
by
the
PAVN
in
April
1975
;
this
marked
the
end
of
the
war
,
and
North
and
South
Vietnam
were
reunified
the
following
year
.


The
scale
of
fighting
was
enormous
:
by
1970
the
ARVN
was
the
world
's
fourth
largest
army
,
with
the
PAVN
being
similar
in
size
at
around
a
million
regular
soldiers
.


The
war
exacted
a
huge
human
cost
in
terms
of
fatalities
(
see
Vietnam
War
casualties
)
:
estimates
of
the
number
of
Vietnamese
soldiers
and
civilians
killed
vary
from
966,000
to
3.8
million
.


Some
275,000–310,000
Cambodians
,
20,000–62,000
Laotians
,
and
58,220
U.S.
service
members
also
died
in
the
conflict
,
and
a
further
1,626
remain
missing
in
action
.


The
Sino-Soviet
split
re-emerged
following
the
lull
during
the
Vietnam
War
and
conflict
between
North
Vietnam
and
its
Cambodian
allies
in
the
Royal
Government
of
the
National
Union
of
Kampuchea
,
and
the
newly-formed
Democratic
Kampuchea
begun
almost
immediately
in
a
series
of
border
raids
by
the
Khmer
Rouge
that
erupted
into
the
Cambodian–Vietnamese
War
,
with
Chinese
forces
directly
invading
in
the
Sino-Vietnamese
War
and
subsequent
border
conflicts
.


Insurgencies
were
fought
by
the
unified
Vietnam
against
insurgencies
in
all
three
countries
.


The
end
of
the
war
and
resumption
of
the
Third
Indochina
War
would
precipitate
the
Vietnamese
boat
people
and
the
bigger
Indochina
refugee
crisis
,
which
saw
millions
of
refugees
leave
Indochina
(
mainly
southern
Vietnam
)
,
an
estimated
250,000
of
whom
perished
at
sea
.


Within
the
US
the
war
gave
rise
to
what
was
referred
to
as
Vietnam
Syndrome
,
a
public
aversion
to
American
overseas
military
involvements
,
which
together
with
Watergate
contributed
to
the
crisis
of
confidence
that
affected
America
throughout
the
1970s
.


Unforgiven
(
1999
)
was
the
second
Unforgiven
professional
wrestling
pay-per-view
(
PPV
)
event
produced
by
World
Wrestling
Federation
(
WWF
)
.


It
took
place
on
September
26
,
1999
,
at
the
Charlotte
Coliseum
in
Charlotte
,
North
Carolina
.


The
main
event
was
a
Six-Pack
Challenge–a
non-elimination
match
consisting
of
six
wrestlers
for
the
vacant
WWF

.


Stone
Cold
Steve
Austin
served
as
the
special

.


The

,
Mankind
,
Kane

However
,
only

.


He
refereed
Dudley
Boyz
vs

The
Acolytes
,
the
WWF
Tag

match
and
the

.


The
previous
event
was
held
in
April
while
the
1999
edition
was
moved
to
September
as
Backlash
took
Unforgiven
's
place
.


Unforgiven
replaced
that
was
held
in
September
1998
.


Unforgiven
continued
to
being
used
as
a
pay-per-view
for
the
month
of
September
until
its
final
edition
in
2008
as
it
was
replaced
by
Breaking
Point
in
2009
.


The
Battle
of
Marj
Ardabil
or
the
Battle
of
Ardabil
was
a
battle
fought
on
the
plains
surrounding
the
city
of
Ardabil
in
northwestern
Iran
in
730
.


A
Khazar
army
led
by
Barjik
,
the
son
of
the
Khazar
khagan
,
invaded
the
Umayyad
provinces
of
Jibal
and
Adharybaydjian
in
retaliation
for
Caliphate
attacks
on
Khazaria
during
the
course
of
the
decades-long
Khazar-Arab
War
of
the
early
8th
century
.


Barjik
's
expedition
into
northern
Iran
(
and
later
into
Kurdistan
and
northern
Mesopotamia
)
may
have
been
an
attempt
to
establish
Khazar
rule
south
of
the
Caucasus
Mountains
.


An
outnumbered
force
led
by
the
Umayyad
general
al-Jarrah
ibn
Abdallah
engaged
the
Khazars
for
three
days
.


Ultimately
,
abandoned
by
many
of
their
``
mawali
''
auxiliaries
,
the
Caliph
's
forces
were
overwhelmed
and
defeated
.


During
the
course
of
the
battle
,
al-Jarrah
was
killed
.


The
victorious
Barjik
mounted
his
head
on
top
of
the
throne
from
which
he
commanded
the
battles
of
his
Middle
Eastern
campaign
.


According
to
the
historian
Agapius
,
the
Arabs
suffered
20,000
dead
and
twice
that
number
captured
,
a
figure
which
probably
includes
the
population
of
Ardabil
and
the
surrounding
territories
.


Following
their
victory
,
the
Khazars
occupied
Ardabil
.


The
next
year
,
however
,
Barjik
led
an
army
to
Mosul
and
was
defeated
.


According
to
Muhammad
ibn
Jarir
al-Tabari
and
other
Arab
historians
,
the
Muslims
were
so
enraged
by
Barjik
's
desecration
of
their
commander
's
head
that
they
fought
with
extra
vigor
.


The
Khazar
army
at
Mosul
was
defeated
and
withdrew
north
of
the
Caucasus
Mountains
.


The
1994
Pro
Bowl
was
the
NFL
's
all-star
game
for
the
1993
season
.


The
game
was
played
on
February
6
,
1994
,
at
Aloha
Stadium
in
Honolulu
,
Hawaii
.


The
final
Score
was
NFC
17
,
AFC
3
.


Andre
Rison
of
the
Atlanta
Falcons
was
the
game
's
MVP
.


This
was
also
Joe
Montana
's
last
Pro
Bowl
appearance
(
coincidentally
,
the
coaches
for
this
game
were
from
both
teams
that
Montana
played
for
in
his
career
:
Kansas
City
's
Marty
Schottenheimer
and
San
Francisco
's
George
Seifert
)
.


The
referee
was
Gordon
McCarter
.


The
game
was
tied
3-3
at
halftime
on
field
goals
by
Norm
Johnson
of
the
Atlanta
Falcons
and
Gary
Anderson
of
the
Pittsburgh
Steelers
.


The
NFC
scored
late
in
the
3rd
quarter
on
a
4-yard
touchdown
run
by
Los
Angeles
Ram
rookie
,
Jerome
Bettis
.


The
NFC
scored
again
in
the
4th
quarter
on
a
touchdown
pass
from
Bobby
Hebert
(
Falcons
)
to
Cris
Carter
(
Minnesota
Vikings
)
to
provide
the
final
margin
.


During
World
War
II
,
Operation
Grenade
was
the
crossing
of
the
Roer
river
between
Roermond
and
Düren
by
the
U.S.
Ninth
Army
,
commanded
by
Lieutenant
General
William
Hood
Simpson
,
in
February
1945
,
which
marked
the
beginning
of
the
Allied
invasion
of
Germany
.


On
9
February
,
the
U.S.
Ninth
Army—operating
under
Field
Marshal
Sir
Bernard
Montgomery
's
Anglo-Canadian
21st
Army
Group
since
the
Battle
of
the
Bulge—was
to
cross
the
Roer
and
link
up
with
the
Canadian
First
Army
,
under
Lieutenant-General
Harry
Crerar
,
coming
from
the
Nijmegen
area
of
the
Netherlands
in
Operation
Veritable
,
which
had
started
at
05:00
on
8
February
.


However
,
once
the
Canadians
had
advanced
,
the
Germans
destroyed
the
dams
upstream
.


This
stopped
the
Americans
from
crossing
as
planned
.


It
had
been
anticipated
that
the
Germans
would
try
to
do
this
,
and
that
General
Omar
Bradley′s
U.S.
12th
Army
Group
could
capture
them
in
time
to
stop
the
flooding
.


During
the
two
weeks
that
the
river
was
flooded
,
Hitler
would
not
allow
Generalfeldmarschall
Gerd
von
Rundstedt
to
withdraw
behind
the
Rhine
,
arguing
that
it
would
only
delay
the
inevitable
fight
.


He
ordered
him
to
fight
where
his
forces
stood
.


The
Ninth
Army
was
finally
able
to
cross
the
river
on
23
February
.


By
then
,
other
Allied
forces
were
also
close
to
the
Rhine
.


German
forces
west
of
the
Rhine
during
operations
Veritable
,
Blockbuster
and
Grenade
lost
90,000
men
,
of
which
more
than
50,000
became
prisoners
of
war
(
POW
)
.


Allied
casualties
amounted
to
some
23,000
men
.


Cyclone
Hudah
was
a
powerful
and
destructive
tropical
cyclone
that
affected
Southeast
Africa
in
April
2000
.


It
was
the
last
in
a
series
of
three
cyclones
that
impacted
Madagascar
during
the
year
.


Hudah
first
developed
as
a
disturbance
embedded
within
the
monsoon
trough
on
March
22
,
within
the
Australian
region
cyclone
basin
.


Moving
westward
as
the
result
of
a
strong
subtropical
ridge
to
its
south
,
the
storm
quickly
intensified
,
and
reached
Category
2
cyclone
intensity
on
March
25
before
entering
the
Southwest
Indian
cyclone
basin
.


For
various
reasons
that
remain
unknown
,
the
cyclone
was
only
designated
a
name
by
the
time
it
had
crossed
into
the
area
of
responsibility
of
the
Regional
Specialized
Meteorological
Center
in
Réunion
.


Nonetheless
,
Météo-France
(
MFR
)
assigned
the
name
``
Hudah
''
to
the
cyclone
.


An
eye
formed
,
and
the
storm
intensified
into
a
tropical
cyclone
on
March
27
well
to
the
southeast
of
Diego
Garcia
.


On
April
1
,
the
MFR
upgraded
it
to
a
very
intense
tropical
cyclone
,
estimating
peak
10
minute
winds
of
225
km/h
(
140
mph
)
.


by
contrast
,
the
joint
typhoon
warning
center
(
jtwc
)
estimated
1
minute
winds
of
235
km/h
(
145
mph
)
.


Cyclone
Hudah
maintained
peak
winds
until
making
landfall
just
southeast
of
Antalaha
,
Madagascar
on
April
2
.


It
weakened
greatly
over
land
,
but
re-attained
tropical
cyclone
status
on
April
5
after
moving
over
the
Mozambique
Channel
.


Hudah
reached
10
minute
winds
of
160
km/h
(
100
mph
)
by
the
time
it
made
landfall
on
Mozambique
near
Pebane
,
Mozambique
,
on
April
8
,
and
dissipated
by
the
next
day
.


While
in
the
vicinity
,
Hudah
brought
moderate
winds
to
Rodrigues
,
St.
Brandon
,
and
Tromelin
Island
.


The
cyclone
affected
the
same
parts
of
Madagascar
that
were
previously
impacted
by
cyclones
Eline
and
Gloria
.


Waves
reached
at
least
8
m
(
26
ft
)
in
height
along
the
coast
.


The
storm
was
considered
the
worst
to
affect
the
Antalaha
region
in
20
years
,
where
90
%
of
homes
were
destroyed
.


It
was
estimated
that
the
storm
left
at
least
100,000
people
homeless
in
Madagascar
,
and
there
were
111
deaths
.


In
Mozambique
,
damage
was
much
less
than
expected
,
and
the
storm
affected
areas
farther
north
in
the
country
than
where
Eline
struck
.


Heavy
rainfall
occurred
along
the
coast
,
but
was
insufficient
to
cause
river
flooding
.


Strong
winds
damaged
roofs
and
downed
trees
,
mostly
around
Pebane
,
and
the
storm
killed
three
people
.


The
Second
Battle
of
Kehl
occurred
on
18
September
1796
,
when
General
Franz
Petrasch
's
Austrian
and
Imperial
troops
stormed
the
French-held
bridgehead
over
the
Rhine
river
.


The
village
of
Kehl
,
which
is
now
in
the
German
state
of
Baden-Württemberg
,
was
then
part
of
Baden-Durlach
.


Across
the
river
,
Strasbourg
,
an
Alsatian
city
,
was
a
French
Revolutionary
stronghold
.


This
battle
was
part
of
the
Rhine
Campaign
of
1796
,
in
the
French
Revolutionary
War
of
the
First
Coalition
.


In
the
1790s
,
the
Rhine
was
wild
,
unpredictable
,
and
difficult
to
cross
.


Its
channels
and
tributaries
created
islands
of
trees
and
vegetation
that
were
alternately
submerged
by
floods
or
exposed
during
the
dry
seasons
.


A
complex
of
bridges
,
gates
,
fortifications
and
barrage
dams
linked
Kehl
with
Strasbourg
.


These
had
been
constructed
by
the
fortress
architect
Sébastien
le
Préstre
de
Vauban
in
the
seventeenth
century
.


The
crossings
had
been
contested
before
:
in
1678
during
the
French-Dutch
war
,
in
1703
during
the
War
of
the
Spanish
Succession
,
in
1733
during
the
War
of
the
Polish
Succession
,
and
earlier
in
Battle
of
Kehl
,
when
the
French
crossed
into
the
German
states
on
23–24
June
.


Critical
to
French
success
would
be
the
army
's
ability
to
cross
the
Rhine
at
will
.


The
crossings
at
Hüningen
,
near
the
Swiss
city
of
Basel
,
and
at
Kehl
,
offered
access
to
most
of
southwestern
Germany
;
from
there
,
French
armies
could
sweep
north
,
south
,
or
east
,
depending
on
their
military
goal
.


In
late
summer
of
1796
,
the
Austrian
force
reacquired
most
of
the
territory
lost
to
the
French
earlier
in
the
summer
.


On
18
September
1796
,
the
Austrians
temporarily
acquired
control
of
the
``
tête-du-ponts
''
(
bridgeheads
)
joining
Kehl
and
Strasbourg
until
a
strong
French
counter-attack
forced
them
to
retreat
,
leaving
the
French
in
control
of
the
bridges
but
the
Austrians
in
control
of
the
territory
surrounding
them
.


The
situation
remained
in
``
status
quo
''
until
late
October
.


Control
of
the
surrounding
territory
there
prevented
the
French
from
crossing
to
safety
in
Strasbourg
,
and
required
the
French
commander
,
Jean
Victor
Marie
Moreau
,
to
withdraw
toward
Basel
.


Immediately
after
the
Battle
of
Schliengen
(
24
October
1796
)
,
while
most
of
Moreau
's
army
retreated
south
to
cross
the
Rhine
at
Hüningen
,
Count
Baillet
Latour
moved
his
Austrian
force
to
Kehl
to
begin
a
100-day
siege
.


The
Iran
crisis
of
1946
,
also
known
as
the
Azerbaijan
Crisis
(
translit
.


:
``
Qaʾilih
Âzarbâyjân
''
)
in
the
Iranian
sources
,
was
one
of
the
first
crises
of
the
Cold
War
,
sparked
by
the
refusal
of
Joseph
Stalin
's
Soviet
Union
to
relinquish
occupied
Iranian
territory
,
despite
repeated
assurances
.


The
end
of
World
War
II
should
have
resulted
in
the
end
of
the
Allied
joint
occupation
of
Iran
.


Instead
,
Pro-Soviet
Iranians
proclaimed
the
separatist
Azerbaijan
People
's
Government
and
the
Kurdish
separatist
Republic
of
Mahabad
.


The
United
States
pressured
Soviet
withdrawal
in
the
earliest
success
of
the
new
containment
strategy
.


As
of
August
1941
,
the
United
States
was
a
neutral
nation
and
had
not
yet
entered
as
a
belligerent
in
World
War
II
.


Therefore
,
the
bloc
known
as
'The
Allies
'
were
principally
(
with
Poland
and
France
occupied
by
Germany
in
1939
and
1940
,
respectively
)
the
United
Kingdom
and
the
Soviet
Union
,
recently
forming
their
alliance
after
the
German
invasion
of
territories
of
the
Western
Soviet
Union
in
June
1941
.


In
August–September
1941
,
Pahlavi
Iran
had
been
jointly
invaded
and
occupied
by
the
Allied
powers
of
the
Soviet
Red
Army
in
the
north
and
by
the
British
in
the
centre
and
south
.


Iran
was
used
by
the
Americans
and
the
British
as
a
transportation
route
to
provide
vital
supplies
to
the
Soviet
Union
's
war
efforts
.


In
the
aftermath
of
the
occupation
of
Iran
,
those
Allied
forces
agreed
to
withdraw
from
Iran
within
six
months
after
the
cessation
of
hostilities
.


However
,
when
this
deadline
came
in
early
1946
,
the
Soviets
,
under
Joseph
Stalin
,
remained
in
Iran
.


Soon
,
the
alliance
of
the
Kurdish
and
People
's
Azerbaijani
forces
,
supported
in
arms
and
training
by
the
Soviet
Union
,
engaged
in
fighting
with
Iranian
forces
,
resulting
in
a
total
of
2,000
casualties
.


Negotiation
by
Iranian
premier
Ahmad
Qavam
and
diplomatic
pressure
on
the
Soviets
by
the
United
States
eventually
led
to
Soviet
withdrawal
and
dissolution
of
the
separatist
Azeri
and
Kurdish
states
.


The
Siege
of
Syracuse
in
827–828
marks
the
first
attempt
by
the
Aghlabids
to
conquer
the
city
of
Syracuse
in
Sicily
,
then
a
Byzantine
province
.


The
Aghlabid
army
had
only
months
before
landed
on
Sicily
,
ostensibly
in
support
of
the
rebel
Byzantine
general
Euphemius
.


After
defeating
local
forces
and
taking
the
fortress
of
Mazara
,
they
marched
on
Syracuse
,
which
was
the
capital
of
the
island
under
Roman
and
Byzantine
rule
.


The
siege
lasted
through
the
winter
of
827–828
and
until
summer
,
during
which
time
the
besieging
forces
suffered
greatly
from
lack
of
food
and
an
outbreak
of
an
epidemic
,
which
claimed
the
life
of
their
commander
,
Asad
ibn
al-Furat
.


In
the
face
of
Byzantine
reinforcements
,
the
new
Arab
leader
,
Muhammad
ibn
Abi
'
l-Jawari
,
abandoned
the
siege
and
withdrew
to
the
southwestern
part
of
the
island
,
which
remained
in
their
hands
.


From
there
they
pursued
the
slow
conquest
of
Sicily
,
which
led
to
the
fall
of
Syracuse
after
another
long
siege
in
877–878
,
and
culminated
in
the
fall
of
Taormina
in
902
.


Cyclone
Ulli
(
also
named
Cyclone
Emil
by
the
Norwegian
Meteorological
Institute
)
was
an
intense
and
deadly
European
windstorm
.


Forming
on
December
31
,
2011
off
the
coast
of
New
Jersey
,
Ulli
began
a
rapid
strengthening
phase
on
January
2
as
it
sped
across
the
Atlantic
.


In
the
late
hours
of
January
1
,
Met
Éireann
issued
a
national
severe
weather
warning
for
Connacht
and
Ulster
and
forecasters
predicting
winds
speeds
up
to
87
mph
with
heavy
driving
rain
.


On
January
2
,
the
Met
Office
issued
an
amber
weather
warning
for
most
of
Scotland
for
heavy
snow
and
strong
winds
.


Forecasters
predicted
wind
speeds
up
to
80
mph
,
and
heavy
rain
,
leading
to
localized
flooding
.


Temperatures
were
expected
to
plummet
from
a
record
high
of
recorded
in
southern
England
on
New
Year
's
Eve
to
.


during
the
late
hours
of
january
2
,
the
european
storm
forecast
experiment
(
unk
)
issued
a
level
two
warning
for
southeast
england
,
the
netherlands
,
north
belgium
,
north
germany
and
denmark
.


Ulli
was
the
costliest
disaster
in
January
2012
globally
.


The
damage
from
the
storm
in
Glasgow
was
also
compared
to
a
storm
in
1968
.


Ulli
was
one
of
many
storms
to
affect
Europe
during
the
winter
of
2011-2012
.


The
storm
clustering
began
in
late-November
when
Xaver
and
Yoda
hit
the
United
Kingdom
and
Norway
.


In
early
to
mid-December
,
Friedhelm
,
Hergen
and
Joachim
hit
northern
Europe
.


Another
storm
,
Patrick
hit
Scandinavia
on
Christmas
Day
.


Ulli
was
followed
by
Andrea
which
formed
the
next
day
and
struck
northern
Europe
on
5
January
.


Operation
``
Phantom
Phoenix
''
was
a
major
nationwide
offensive
launched
by
the
Multinational
Force
Iraq
(
MNF-I
)
on
8
January
2008
in
an
attempt
to
build
on
the
success
of
the
two
previous
corps-level
operations
,
Operation
Phantom
Thunder
and
Operation
Phantom
Strike
and
further
reduce
violence
and
secure
Iraq
's
population
,
particularly
in
the
capital
Baghdad
.


The
offensive
consisted
of
a
number
of
joint
Coalition
and
Iraqi
Army
operations
throughout
northern
Iraq
as
well
as
in
the
southern
Baghdad
Belts
.


The
northern
operation
was
designated
Operation
Iron
Harvest
.


Its
objective
was
to
hunt
down
the
remaining
200
Al-Qaeda
extremists
remaining
in
the
province
of
Diyala
following
the
end
of
the
previous
offensive
.


The
operation
also
included
targeting
insurgent
elements
in
Salah
ad-Din
province
and
Nineveh
province
.


The
southern
operation
was
designated
Operation
Marne
Thunderbolt
and
targeted
insurgent
safe
havens
in
the
belts
to
the
south-east
of
Baghdad
,
particularly
the
Arab
Jabour
region
.


Additionally
,
Phantom
Phoenix
's
aims
were
the
remaining
car
,
truck
and
suicide
bomb
networks
in
Baghdad
as
well
as
al-Qaeda
’
s
financial
network
.


The
1929
Arab
riots
in
Palestine
,
or
the
Buraq
Uprising
(
,
)
,
also
known
as
the
1929
Massacres
,
(
,
,
``
lit
.
''


Events
of
5689
Anno
Mundi
)
refers
to
a
series
of
demonstrations
and
riots
in
late
August
1929
when
a
long-running
dispute
between
Muslims
and
Jews
over
access
to
the
Western
Wall
in
Jerusalem
escalated
into
violence
.


The
riots
took
the
form
,
in
the
most
part
,
of
attacks
by
Arabs
on
Jews
accompanied
by
destruction
of
Jewish
property
.


During
the
week
of
riots
from
23
to
29
August
,
133
Jews
were
killed
and
between
198–241
others
were
injured
,
a
large
majority
of
whom
were
unarmed
and
were
murdered
in
their
homes
by
Arabs
,
while
at
least
116
Arabs
were
killed
and
at
least
232
were
injured
,
mostly
by
the
British
police
while
trying
to
suppress
the
riots
,
although
around
20
were
killed
by
Jewish
attacks
or
indiscriminate
British
gunfire
.


On
the
first
day
of
the
riots
,
the
British
government
had
enlisted
and
armed
41
Jewish
special
constables
,
18
Jewish
ex-soldiers
and
a
further
60
Jews
were
issued
staves
.


During
the
riots
,
17
Jewish
communities
were
evacuated
.


the
unk
shaw
commission
found
that
the
fundamental
cause
of
the
violence
``
without
which
in
our
opinion
disturbances
either
would
not
have
occurred
or
would
not
have
been
little
more
than
a
local
riot
,
is
the
arab
feeling
of
animosity
and
hostility
towards
the
jews
consequent
upon
the
disappointment
of
their
political
and
national
aspirations
and
fear
for
their
economic
future
,
”
as
well
as
arab
fears
of
jewish
immigrants
``
not
only
as
a
menace
to
their
livelihood
but
as
a
possible
overlord
of
the
future
.
''


with
respect
to
the
triggering
of
the
riots
,
the
commission
found
that
the
incident
which
``
contributed
most
to
the
outbreak
was
the
jewish
demonstration
at
the
wailing
wall
on
15
august
1929
''
.


Avraham
Sela
described
the
riots
as
``
unprecedented
in
the
history
of
the
Arab-Jewish
conflict
in
Palestine
,
in
duration
,
geographical
scope
and
direct
damage
to
life
and
property

The
Battle
of
Monastir
took
place
near
the
town
of
Bitola
,
Macedonia
(
then
known
as
Monastir
)
during
the
First
Balkan
War
,
from
the
16th
to
19th
November
1912
.


As
an
ongoing
part
of
the
Balkan
Wars
,
the
Ottoman
Vardar
Army
retreated
from
the
defeat
at
Kumanovo
and
regrouped
around
Bitola
.


The
Serbian
1st
Army
,
marching
for
Bitola
,
encountered
heavy
Ottoman
artillery
fire
and
had
to
wait
for
its
own
artillery
to
arrive
.


On
the
18th
November
,
following
the
destruction
of
the
Ottoman
artillery
by
Serbian
artillery
,
the
Serbian
right
flank
pushed
through
the
Vardar
Army
.


The
Serbs
then
entered
Bitola
on
the19th
November
.


With
the
conquest
of
Bitola
the
Serbs
controlled
southwestern
Macedonia
,
including
the
symbolically
important
town
of
Ohrid
.


The
Fatuha
train
crash
was
a
rail
transport
accident
that
occurred
on
4
April
1998
,
in
India
.


Removal
of
fishplates
led
to
the
packed
Howrah-Danapur
Express
jumping
tracks
,
killing
at
least
11
passengers
and
injuring
more
than
50
others
near
Fatuha
Station
in
Fatuha
city
on
the
Eastern
Railway
's
Danapur
division
.


In
all
,
nine
bogies
derailed
disrupting
traffic
.


Local
citizens
assisted
the
injured
at
the
scene
until
authorities
arrived
.


The
injured
were
rushed
to
the
PMC
hospital
,
Nalanda
Medical
College
hospital
and
a
hospital
in
Patna
,
about
from
the
accident
site
.


The
remaining

The
2010
Bratislava
shooting
,
or
Devínska
Nová
Ves
shooting
,
occurred
on
30
August
2010
,
when
seven
people
were
killed
and
at
least
17
were
injured
by
a
lone
gunman
who
opened
fire
in
Devínska
Nová
Ves
district
in
a
suburb
of
the
Slovak
capital
,
Bratislava
.


The
gunman
then
committed
suicide
.


The
shooting
spree
took
place
both
inside
a
local
panel
building
and
later
in
the
street
outside
.


This
was
the
second-deadliest
attack
in
the
modern
history
of
Slovakia
.


This
was
also
the
first
time
in
Slovak
history
that
a
mass
murderer
went
on
a
shooting
spree
.


According
to
police
chief
Jaroslav
Spišiak
,
Slovak
police
has
to
consult
with
other
countries
and
find
the
best
procedures
for
these
cases
,
something
that
has
not
yet
been
done
,
as
of
February
2011
.


The
shooting
remains
controversial
not
only
because
the
killer
's
motive
remains
unknown
,
but
also
because
of
purposefully
withholding
information
from
the
public
by
the
authorities
and
what
is
generally
perceived
as
a
failed
police
action
.


Cyclone
Bella
was
a
destructive
tropical
cyclone
that
passed
near
the
Mauritius
outer
island
of
Rodrigues
.


The
second
named
storm
of
the
season
,
Bella
originated
in
the
middle
of
January
1991
from
a
surge
in
the
monsoon
trough
to
the
southwest
of
Sumatra
.


For
several
days
,
the
system
remained
weak
as
it
moved
generally
west-southwestward
.


On
January
25
,
it
intensified
to
tropical
storm
status
,
but
Bella
took
three
more
days
to
intensify
to
tropical
cyclone
status
,
with
10
minute
maximum
sustained
winds
of
120
kilometres
per
hour
(
75
miles
per
hour
)
.


The
cyclone
attained
peak
intensity
on
January
29
,
officially
reaching
winds
of
155
km/h
(
100
mph
)
.


the
joint
typhoon
warning
center
unofficially
estimated
winds
of
240
km/h
(
150
mph
)
,
the
highest
the
agency
estimated
for
any
storm
in
the
southern
hemisphere
in
the
year
.


Bella
later
turned
to
the
southeast
and
weakened
,
passing
about
50
km
(
30
mi
)
west
of
Rodrigues
on
January
31
.


The
storm
turned
to
the
south-southwest
and
back
to
the
southeast
again
,
becoming
extratropical
on
February
4
.


While
passing
near
Rodrigues
,
Bella
produced
strong
winds
and
high
tides
,
the
latter
of
which
caused
flooding
in
the
capital
Port
Mathurin
.


The
storm
was
considered
the
worst
on
the
island
in
20
years
.


About
1,500
homes
were
damaged
or
destroyed
,
leaving
1,000
people
homeless
.


Bella
also
severely
damaged
crops
,
roads
,
and
the
power
grid
on
Rodrigues
.


The
storm
killed
about
half
of
the
Rodrigues
flying
fox
,
a
critically
endangered
species
.


Elsewhere
,
Bella
was
believed
to
have
sunk
a
Madagascar
cargo
ship
,
with
its
36
people
on
board
.


tropical
storm
odile
was
a
late
season
tropical
storm
that
formed
during
the
2008
pacific
hurricane
season
and
affected
parts
of
southern
mexico
.


a
tropical
depression
formed
on
october
8
,
and
became
tropical
storm
odile
18
hours
later
.


The
storm
paralleled
the
south
coast
of
Mexico
,
with
the
center
located
only
several
miles
offshore
.


After
peaking
in
intensity
,
increasing
southeasterly
vertical
wind
shear
induced
a
trend
of
rapid
weakening
on
the
storm
.


Correspondingly
,
Odile
was
downgraded
to
a
tropical
depression
early
on
12
October
,
subsequently
degenerating
into
a
remnant
low
about
55
mi
(
85
km
)
south
of
Manzanillo
,
Colima
.


From
thereon
,
the
low
proceeded
slowly
south-southwestward
before
dissipating
on
October
13
.


since
odile
stayed
at
sea
,
its
effects
along
coastlines
were
limited
.


The
most
notable
damages
were
caused
by
flooding
along
the
southern
coast
of
Mexico
,
mostly
in
Chiapas
,
Oaxaca
,
Guerrero
and
Michoacán
.


The
exact
amount
of
damage
,
however
,
remains
unknown
,
and
no
fatalities
were
reported
as
a
result
of
the
storm
.


The
Revolt
of
the
Comuneros
(
,
``
War
of
the
Communities
of
Castile
''
)
was
an
uprising
by
citizens
of
Castile
against
the
rule
of
Charles
I
and
his
administration
between
1520
and
1521
.


at
its
height
,
the
rebels
controlled
the
heart
of
castile
,
ruling
the
cities
of
valladolid
,
tordesillas
,
and
toledo
.


The
revolt
occurred
in
the
wake
of
political
instability
in
the
Crown
of
Castile
after
the
death
of
Queen
Isabella
I
in
1504
.


Isabella
's
daughter
Joanna
succeeded
to
the
throne
.


Due
to
Joanna
's
mental
instability
,
Castile
was
ruled
by
the
nobles
and
her
father
,
King
Ferdinand
II
of
Aragon
,
as
a
regent
.


After
Ferdinand
's
death
in
1516
,
Joanna
's
sixteen-year-old
son
Charles
was
proclaimed
king
of
both
Castile
and
Aragon
.


Charles
had
been
raised
in
the
Netherlands
with
little
knowledge
of
Castilian
.


He
arrived
in
Spain
in
October
1517
accompanied
by
a
large
retinue
of
Flemish
nobles
and
clerics
.


These
factors
resulted
in
mistrust
between
the
new
king
and
the
Castilian
social
elites
,
who
could
see
the
threat
to
their
power
and
status
.


In
1519
,
Charles
was
elected
Holy
Roman
Emperor
.


He
departed
for
Germany
in
1520
,
leaving
the
Dutch
cardinal
Adrian
of
Utrecht
to
rule
Castile
in
his
absence
.


Soon
,
a
series
of
anti-government
riots
broke
out
in
the
cities
,
and
local
city
councils
(
``
Comunidades
''
)
took
power
.


The
rebels
chose
Charles
'
own
mother
,
Queen
Joanna
,
as
an
alternative
ruler
,
hoping
they
could
control
her
madness
.


The
rebel
movement
took
on
a
radical
anti-feudal
dimension
,
supporting
peasant
rebellions
against
the
landed
nobility
.


On
April
23
,
1521
,
after
nearly
a
year
of
rebellion
,
the
reorganized
supporters
of
the
emperor
struck
a
crippling
blow
to
the
comuneros
at
the
Battle
of
Villalar
.


The
following
day
,
rebel
leaders
Juan
López
de
Padilla
,
Juan
Bravo
,
and
Francisco
Maldonado
were
beheaded
.


The
army
of
the
comuneros
fell
apart
.


Only
the
city
of
Toledo
kept
alive
the
rebellion
led
by
María
Pacheco
,
until
its
surrender
in
October
1521
.


The
character
of
the
revolution
is
a
matter
of
historiographical
debate
.


According
to
some
scholars
,
the
revolt
was
one
of
the
first
modern
revolutions
,
notably
because
of
the
anti-noble
sentiment
against
social
injustice
and
its
basis
on
ideals
of
democracy
and
freedom
.


Others
consider
it
a
more
typical
rebellion
against
high
taxes
and
perceived
foreign
control
.


From
the
19th
century
onwards
,
the
revolt
has
been
mythologized
by
various
Spaniards
,
generally
liberals
who
drew
political
inspiration
from
it
.


Conservative
intellectuals
have
traditionally
adopted
more
pro-Imperial
stances
toward
the
revolt
,
and
have
been
critical
of
both
the
motives
and
the
government
of
the
comuneros
.


With
the
end
of
Franco
's
dictatorship
and
the
establishment
of
the
autonomous
community
of
Castile
and
León
,
positive
commemoration
of
the
``
Comunidades
''
has
grown
.


April
23
is
now
celebrated
as
Castile
and
León
Day
,
and
the
incident
is
often
referred
to
in
Castilian
nationalism
.


The
Khojaly
Massacre
,
also
known
as
the
Khojaly
tragedy
,
was
the
killing
of
at
least
161
ethnic
Azerbaijani
civilians
from
the
town
of
Khojaly
on
26
February
1992
.


According
to
the
Azerbaijani
side
,
as
well
as
the
Memorial
Human
Rights
Center
,
Human
Rights
Watch
and
other
international
observers
,
the
massacre
was
committed
by
the
ethnic
Armenian
armed
forces
,
reportedly
with
help
of
some
military
personnel
of
the
366th
CIS
regiment
,
apparently
not
acting
on
orders
from
the
command
.


The
death
toll
claimed
by
Azerbaijani
authorities
is
613
civilians
,
including
106
women
and
63
children
.


The
event
became
the
largest
massacre
in
the
course
of
the
Nagorno-Karabakh
conflict
.


Western
governments
and
the
western
media
refer
to
it
as
the
``
Khojaly
massacre
''
,
``
Khojaly
tragedy
''
or
the
``
Battle
for
Khojaly
''
.


Azerbaijani
sources
occasionally
refer
to
the
massacre
as
the
``
Khojaly
genocide
''
(
)
and
the
``
Khojaly
tragedy
''
(
)
.


The
frigate
action
of
29
May
1794—not
to
be
confused
with
the
much
larger
fleet
action
of
29
May
1794
that
took
place
in
the
same
waters
at
the
same
time—was
a
minor
naval
engagement
of
the
French
Revolutionary
Wars
between
a
Royal
Navy
frigate
and
a
French
Navy
frigate
.


The
action
formed
a
minor
part
of
the
Atlantic
campaign
of
May
1794
,
a
campaign
which
culminated
in
the
battle
of
the
Glorious
First
of
June
,
and
was
unusual
in
that
the
French
ship
``
Castor
''
had
only
been
in
French
hands
for
a
few
days
at
the
time
of
the
engagement
.


``
Castor
''
had
previously
been
a
British
ship
,
seized
on
19
May
by
a
French
battle
squadron
in
the
Bay
of
Biscay
and
converted
to
French
service
while
still
at
sea
.


While
the
main
fleets
manoeuvered
around
one
another
,
``
Castor
''
was
detached
in
pursuit
of
a
Dutch
merchant
ship
and
on
29
May
encountered
the
smaller
independently
cruising
British
frigate
HMS
``
Carysfort
''
.


Captain
Francis
Laforey
on
``
Carysfort
''
immediately
attacked
the
larger
ship
and
in
an
engagement
lasting
an
hour
and
fifteen
minutes
successfully
forced
its
captain
to
surrender
,
discovering
a
number
of
British
prisoners
of
war
below
decks
.


``
Castor
''
was
subsequently
taken
back
to
Britain
and
an
extended
legal
case
ensued
between
the
Admiralty
and
Captain
Laforey
over
the
amount
of
prize
money
that
should
be
awarded
for
the
victory
.


Ultimately
Laforey
was
successful
,
in
part
due
to
testimony
from
the
defeated
French
captain
,
proving
his
case
and
claiming
the
prize
money
.


The
lawsuit
did
not
harm
Laforey
's
career
and
he
later
served
at
the
Battle
of
Trafalgar
and
became
a
prominent
admiral
.


The
Volcano
and
Ryūkyū
Islands
Campaign
was
a
series
of
battles
and
engagements
between
Allied
forces
and
Imperial
Japanese
forces
in
the
Pacific
Ocean
campaign
of
World
War
II
between
January
and
June
1945
.


The
campaign
took
place
in
the
Volcano
and
Ryukyu
island
groups
.


The
two
main
land
battles
in
the
campaign
were
the
Battle
of
Iwo
Jima
(
February
16-March
26
,
1945
)
and
the
Battle
of
Okinawa
(
April
1–June
21
,
1945
)
.


One
major
naval
battle
occurred
,
called
Operation
Ten-Go
(
April
7
,
1945
)
after
the
operational
title
given
to
it
by
the
Japanese
.


The
campaign
was
part
of
the
Allied
Japan
campaign
intended
to
provide
staging
areas
for
an
invasion
of
Japan
as
well
as
supporting
aerial
bombardment
and
a
naval
blockade
of
the
Japanese
mainland
.


The
dropping
of
atomic
weapons
on
two
Japanese
cities
and
the
hammer-blow
Soviet
invasion
of
Japanese
Manchuria
,
however
,
caused
the
Japanese
government
to
surrender
without
an
armed
invasion
being
necessary
.


The
Manila

siege
occurred
on
November

,
and
25
other
Magdalo
(

)
officers
walked
out
of
their
trial
and
marched
through
the
streets
of

.


The
mutineers
called
for
the
ousting
of
President

,
and
seized
the

as
well
as
some
of
the
soldiers
from

joined
the
march
to
the
hotel
.


After
several
hours
,
Trillanes
and
Lim
surrendered
to
government
forces
after
a
military
armored
personnel
carrier
barged
into
the
glass
door
of
the
hotel
lobby
and
the
hotel
walls
and
windows
sustained
weapons
damage
.


Trillanes
and
the
mutineers
were
arrested
while
several
journalists
covering
the
event
were
detained
.


The
journalists
were
subsequently
released
.


The
Siege
of
Pirna
(
or
Investment
of
Pirna
)
took
place
in
1756
as
part
of
the
Prussian
invasion
of
Saxony
during
the
Third
Silesian
War
(
part
of
the
Seven
Years
'
War
)
.


Following
the
occupation
of
the
capital
Dresden
by
Frederick
the
Great
on
9
September
the
Saxon
army
had
withdrawn
south
and
taken
up
position
at
the
fortress
of
Pirna
under
Frederick
von
Rutowski
.


The
Saxons
hoped
to
receive
relief
from
the
Austrian
army
which
was
across
the
border
in
neighbouring
Bohemia
under
Marshal
Browne
.


Following
the
Battle
of
Lobositz
the
Austrians
withdrew
,
and
tried
to
approach
Pirna
by
a
different
route
but
they
failed
to
make
contact
with
the
defenders
.


Despite
a
Saxon
attempt
to
escape
by
crossing
the
River
Elbe
,
it
soon
became
apparent
that
their
position
was
hopeless
.


On
14
October
Rutowski
concluded
a
capitulation
with
Frederick
.


In
total
18,000
troops
surrendered
.


They
were
swiftly
and
forcibly
incorporated
into
the
Prussian
forces
,
an
act
which
caused
widespread
protest
even
from
Prussians
.


Many
of
them
later
deserted
and
fought
with
the
Austrians
against
the
Prussian
forces
-
with
whole
regiments
changing
sides
at
the
Battle
of
Prague
.


The
Action
of
5
May
1794
was
a
minor
naval
engagement
fought
in
the
Indian
Ocean
during
the
French
Revolutionary
Wars
.


A
British
squadron
had
been
blockading
the
French
island
of
Isle
de
France
(
now
Mauritius
)
since
early
in
the
year
,
and
early
on
5
May
discovered
two
ships
approaching
their
position
.


As
the
strange
vessels
came
closer
,
they
were
recognised
as
the
French
frigate
``
Duguay
Trouin
''
,
which
had
been
captured
from
the
East
India
Company
the
year
before
,
and
a
small
brig
.


Making
use
of
a
favourable
wind
,
the
British
squadron
gave
chase
to
the
new
arrivals
,
which
fled
.


The
chase
was
short
,
as
``
Duguay
Trouin
''
was
a
poor
sailor
with
many
of
the
crew
sick
and
unable
to

The
British
frigate
HMS
``

''
was
the
first
to
arrive
,
and
soon
completely
disabled
the
French

successfully
raking
the

The
Chilean
War
of
Independence
was
a
war
between
pro-independence
Chilean
criollos
seeking
political
and
economic
independence
from
Spain
and
royalist
criollos
supporting
continued
allegiance
to
the
Captaincy
General
of
Chile
and
membership
of
the
Spanish
Empire
.


Traditionally
,
the
beginning
of
the
war
is
dated
as
September
18
,
1810
.


Depending
on
what
terms
are
used
to
define
its
end
,
it
lasted
until
1821
,
when
royalist
forces
were
defeated
by
José
de
San
Martín
;
or
until
1826
,
when
the
last
Spanish
troops
surrendered
and
the
Chiloé
Archipelago
was
incorporated
to
the
Chilean
republic
.


A
declaration
of
independence
was
officially
issued
by
Chile
on
February
12
,
1818
and
formally
recognized
by
Spain
in
1844
,
when
full
diplomatic
relations
were
established
.


The
Chilean
War
of
Independence
was
part
of
the
more
aroused
Spanish
American
wars
of
independence
.


Independence
did
not
have
unanimous
support
among
Chileans
,
who
were
divided
between
independentists
and
royalists
.


What
started
as
a
political
movement
among
elites
against
the
colonial
power
,
ended
as
a
full-fledged
civil
war
.


Traditionally
,
the
process
is
divided
into
three
stages
:
the
``
Patria
Vieja
''
,
1810–1814
;
the
``
Reconquista
''
,
1814–1817
;
and
the
``
Patria
Nueva
''
,
1817–1823
.


There
have
been
at
least
eight
sieges
of
Stirling
Castle
,
a
strategically
important
fortification
in
Stirling
,
Scotland
.


Stirling
is
located
at
the
crossing
of
the
River
Forth
,
making
it
a
key
location
for
access
to
the
north
of
Scotland
.


The
castle
changed
hands
several
times
between
English
and
Scottish
control
during
the
Wars
of
Scottish
Independence
(
1296–1357
)
.


In
1299
,
the
castle
was
in
English
hands
,
when
the
constable
,
John
Sampson
,
was
besieged
by
the
Scots
.


In
1304
,
Edward
I
of
England
besieged
the
Scots
,
deploying
siege
engines
to
force
the
garrison
to
surrender
.


In
1337
,
a
siege
by
Sir
Andrew
Murray
failed
to
retake
the
castle
.


Between
1571
and
1585
,
the
castle
was
besieged
three
times
by
Scots
factions
during
the
reign
of
James
VI
.


In
1651
,
Oliver
Cromwell
captured
the
castle
during
his
invasion
of
Scotland
.


The
final
siege
took
place
in
1746
,
when
Charles
Edward
Stuart
besieged
the
castle
during
the
final
Jacobite
rising
.


Hurricane
Roslyn
was
the
strongest
hurricane
in
the
1986
Pacific
hurricane
season
.


The
17th
and
final
named
storm
of
the
season
,
Roslyn
developed
on
October
15
to
the
south
of
Mexico
.


Its
movement
was
initially
guided
by
a
ridge
to
its
north
,
and
it
became
a
tropical
storm
on
October
16
and
a
hurricane
a
day
later
.


The
hurricane
reached
peak
winds
of
on
October
19
before
weakening
and
turning
to
the
northeast
.


Roslyn
ultimately
moved
ashore
near
Mazatlán
,
Sinaloa
as
a
minimal
hurricane
,
where
it
caused
minimal
damage
due
to
the
light
population
affected
.


It
rapidly
dissipated
,
although
the
remnants
brought
precipitation
to
Texas
and
other
portions
of
the
central
and
southern
United
States
.


There
were
no
fatalities
,
and
reported
damage
was
minor
.


Rock
Against
Sexism
(
RAS
)
was
a
political
and
cultural
movement
dedicated
to
challenging
sexism
in
the
rock
music
community
,
pop
culture
and
in
the
world
at
large
.


It
was
primarily
a
part
of
the
punk
rock
music
and
arts
scene
.


RAS
started
in
the
UK
in
1978
,
and
by
the
mid-1980s
also
had
a
presence
in
North
America
.


It
was
strongly
inspired
and
influenced
by
Rock
Against
Racism
and
the
two
movements
had
many
of
the
same
participants
.


In
the
UK
,
it
began
amid
controversy
when
a
Rock
Against
Racism
event
hired
some
Rastafarian
reggae
bands
that
some
participants
felt
were
misogynistic
.


This
resulted
in
a
discussion
of
sexism
in
music
and
art
.


The
bands
(
Aswad
and
Misty
in
Roots
)
either
responded
by
saying
it
was
the
will
of
God
,
or
that
they
did
n't
know
what
sexism
was
.


The
UK
Rock
Against
Sexism
often
gained
press
coverage
in
the
music
press
,
such
as
the
``
NME
''
.


In
the
US
,
RAS
Boston
sponsored
monthly
dance
parties
at
a
local
gay
bar
,
the
1270
.


They
put
out
a
zine
and
promoted
art
events
and
gigs
by
non-sexist
bands
.


RAS
sponsored
music
workshops
on
writing
,
playing
and
promoting
events
.


Typhoon
Irma
,
known
in
the
Philippines
as
Typhoon
Anding
,
was
a
powerful
typhoon
that
struck
the
Philippines
in
November
1981
.


The
twenty-fifth
named
storm
and
fourteenth
typhoon
of
the
1981
Pacific
typhoon
season
,
Irma
originated
from
an
active
monsoon
trough
to
the
east
of
the
Philippines
.


Following
an
increase
in
organization
,
the
system
was
first
classified
on
November
18
and
was
subsequently
upgraded
into
a
tropical
storm
on
the
next
day
as
it
moved
westward
.


After
passing
near
Guam
,
Irma
continued
to
deepen
,
and
was
estimated
to
have
attained
typhoon
intensity
early
on
November
21
.


The
intensification
rate
accelerated
thereafter
,
and
on
the
afternoon
of
November
22
,
Irma
reached
its
peak
wind
speed
of
.


After
maintaining
this
intensity
for
16
hours
,
Irma
weakened
considerably
due
to
interaction
with
the
mountainous
terrain
of
the
Philippines
.


On
the
morning
of
November
24
,
Irma
moved
ashore
northeast
of
Manila
,
with
winds
of
.


The
storm
rapidly
deteriorated
overland
,
but
was
still
believed
to
have
been
a
typhoon
when
it
emerged
into
the
South
China
Sea
.


Typhoon
Irma
then
began
to
re-curve
towards
the
northwest
while
weakening
;
the
cyclone
was
estimated
to
have
obtained
extratropical
characteristics
on
November
26
.


Affecting
an
area
already
severely
impacted
by
Typhoon
Hazen
,
Typhoon
Irma
brought
significant
damage
and
flooding
to
the
Philippines
,
especially
in
the
province
of
Camarines
Norte
.


Additionally
,
a
tidal
wave
was
noted
in
four
towns
in
the
Camarines
Sur
province
,
resulting
in
the
deaths
of
137
people
.


The
nearby
village
of
Benagaspasan
was
nearly
demolished
,
where
47
fatalities
occurred
.


In
all
,
595
were
killed
due
to
Irma
.


A
total
of
482,678
persons
were
directly
affected
by
Typhoon
Irma
.


Irma
destroyed
or
damaged
119,233
dwellings
,
which
left
nearly
40,000
homeless
.


A
total
of
24,137
families
or
141,974
individuals
left
their
homes
,
including
57,198
that
sought
emergency
shelter
.


Overall
,
damage
totaled
to
$
63.3
million
(
1981
USD
)
.


Hurricane
Caroline
was
one
of
two
tropical
cyclones
to
affect
northern
Mexico
during
the
1975
Atlantic
hurricane
season
.


The
third
named
storm
and
second
hurricane
of
the
season
,
Caroline
developed
on
August
24
north
of
the
Dominican
Republic
.


The
system
crossed
Cuba
and
briefly
degenerated
into
a
tropical
wave
due
to
land
interaction
.


However
,
upon
emergence
into
the
western
Caribbean
Sea
,
it
was
once
again
designated
as
a
tropical
depression
after
a
well-defined
circulation
was
observed
on
satellite
imagery
.


Moving
towards
the
west-northwest
,
the
cyclone
clipped
the
northern
portion
of
the
Yucatán
Peninsula
before
entering
the
Gulf
of
Mexico
.


Caroline
was
upgraded
to
a
tropical
storm
on
August
29
in
the
central
Gulf
of
Mexico
before
rapid
intensification
began
.


Early
on
August
31
,
Caroline
reached
its
peak
intensity
with
winds
of
115
mph
(
185
km/h
)
,
before
landfall
south
of
Brownsville
,
Texas
with
winds
of
105
mph
(
165
km/h
)
shortly
thereafter
.


After
moving
inland
,
Caroline
quickly
weakened
and
dissipated
over
the
mountainous
terrain
of
northeastern
Mexico
on
September
1
.


There
were
only
two
deaths
from
Caroline
,
both
indirect
.


However
,
there
was
heavy
rainfall
in
southern
Texas
and
Mexico
,
including
almost
at
Port
Isabel
.


Typhoon
Dolphin
was
a
powerful
tropical
cyclone
that
produced
the
first
typhoon-force
winds
on
Guam
since
Typhoon
Pongsona
in
2002
.


The
seventh
named
storm
of
the
2015
Pacific
typhoon
season
,
Dolphin
formed
on
May
6
in
the
vicinity
of
the
Federated
States
of
Micronesia
(
FSM
)
.


Moving
eastward
at
first
,
the
storm
slowly
organized
before
beginning
a
north
and
west-northwest
trajectory
.


Dolphin
intensified
into
a
typhoon
before
passing
between
Guam
and
Rota
on
May
15
,
producing
typhoon-force
winds
on
both
islands
.


It
later
rapidly
intensified
as
it
curved
to
the
north
.


the
american-based
joint
typhoon
warning
center
(
jtwc
)
designated
dolphin
as
a
super
typhoon
,
while
the
japan
meteorological
agency
(
jma
)
estimated
10
minute
sustained
winds
of
185
km/h
(
115
mph
)
.


Dolphin
turned
to
the
northeast
and
weakened
,
becoming
extratropical
on
May
20
and
exiting
the
western
Pacific
basin
on
May
24
.


The
storm
first
affected
the
FSM
,
notably
Pohnpei
where
it
dropped
of
rainfall
over
three
days
.


The
rains
and
gusty
winds
knocked
down
many
trees
on
the
island
,
one
of
which
killed
a
person
,
and
causing
$
1
million
in
damage
(
2015
USD
)
.


dolphin
passed
between
guam
and
rota
,
producing
gusts
of
at
andersen
air
force
base
on
northern
guam
.


The
winds
left
40
%
of
the
island
without
power
and
left
at
least
3,300
people
without
water
.


The
storm
also
dropped
heavy
rainfall
,
flooding
Guam
Memorial
Hospital
.


Dolphin
damaged
390
houses
,
including
nine
that
were
destroyed
,
leaving
1,055
people
homeless
.


With
damage
estimated
at
around
$
10
million
,
the
island
was
declared
a
disaster
area
.


The
typhoon
also
brushed
Rota
,
causing
$
2.5
million
in
damage
there
,
as
well
as
Saipan
.


on
4
december
1971
,
the
ulster
volunteer
force
(
uvf
)
,
an
ulster
loyalist
paramilitary
group
,
detonated
a
bomb
at
mcgurk
's
bar
in
belfast
,
northern
ireland
.


The
pub
was
frequented
by
Irish
Catholics/nationalists
.


The
explosion
caused
the
building
to
collapse
,
killing
fifteen
Catholic
civilians—including
two
children—and
wounding
seventeen
more
.


It
was
the
deadliest
attack
in
Belfast
during
the
Troubles
.


Despite
evidence
to
the
contrary
,
the
British
security
forces
asserted
that
a
bomb
had
exploded
prematurely
while
being
handled
by
Irish
Republican
Army
(
IRA
)
members
inside
the
pub
,
implying
that
the
victims
themselves
were
partly
to
blame
.


A
report
later
found
that
the
police
(
Royal
Ulster
Constabulary
)
were
biased
in
favour
of
this
view
,
and
that
this
hindered
their
investigation
.


The
victims
'
relatives
allege
that
the
security
forces
deliberately
spread
disinformation
to
discredit
the
IRA
.


In
1977
,
UVF
member
Robert
Campbell
was
sentenced
to
life
imprisonment
for
his
part
in
the
bombing
and
served
fifteen
years
.


The
bombing
sparked
a
series
of
tit-for-tat
bombings
and
shootings
by
loyalists
and
republicans
,
which
contributed
to
making
1972
the
bloodiest
year
of
the
conflict
.


The
Hatfield–McCoy
feud
,
also
described
by
journalists
as
the
Hatfield–McCoy
war
,
involved
two
rural
families
of
the
West
Virginia–Kentucky
area
along
the
Tug
Fork
of
the
Big
Sandy
River
in
the
years
1863–1891
.


The
Hatfields
of
West
Virginia
were
led
by
William
Anderson
``
Devil
Anse
''
Hatfield
while
the
McCoys
of
Kentucky
were
under
the
leadership
of
Randolph
``
Ole
Ran
'
l
''
McCoy
.


Those
involved
in
the
feud
were
descended
from
Joseph
Hatfield
and
William
McCoy
(
born
1750
)
.


The
feud
has
entered
the
American
folklore
lexicon
as
a
metonym
for
any
bitterly
feuding
rival
parties
.


More
than
a
century
later
,
the
feud
has
become
synonymous
with
the
perils
of
family
honor
,
justice
,
and
revenge
,
recently
brought
to
light
again
by
the
documentary
,
``
Hatfields
vs
.


McCoys
.
''


William
McCoy
,
the
patriarch
of
the
McCoys
,
was
born
in
Ireland
around
1750
and
many
of
his
ancestors
hailed
from
Scotland
.


The
family
,
led
by
grandson
Randolph
McCoy
,
lived
mostly
on
the
Kentucky
side
of
Tug
Fork
(
a
tributary
of
the
Big
Sandy
River
)
.


The
Hatfields
,
led
by
William
Anderson
``
Devil
Anse
''
Hatfield
,
son
of
Ephraim
and
Nancy
(
Vance
)
Hatfield
,
lived
mostly
on
the
West
Virginia
side
.


The
majority
of
the
Hatfields
,
although
living
in
Mingo
County
(
then
part
of
Logan
County
)
,
West
Virginia
,
fought
on
the
Confederate
side
in
the
American
Civil
War
;
most
McCoys
,
living
in
Pike
County
,
Kentucky
,
also
fought
for
the
Confederates
;
with
the
exception
of
Asa
Harmon
McCoy
,
who
fought
for
the
Union
.


The
first
real
violence
in
the
feud
was
the
death
of
Asa
Harmon
McCoy
as
he
returned
from
the
war
,
murdered
by
a
group
of
Confederate
Home
Guards
called
the
Logan
Wildcats
.


Devil
Anse
Hatfield
was
a
suspect
at
first
,
but
was
later
confirmed
to
have
been
sick
at
home
at
the
time
of
the
murder
.


It
was
widely
believed
that
his
uncle
,
Jim
Vance
,
a
member
of
the
Wildcats
,
committed
the
murder
.


The
Hatfields
were
more
affluent
than
the
McCoys
and
were
well-connected
politically
.


Devil
Anse
Hatfield
's
timbering
operation
was
a
source
of
wealth
for
his
family
,
while
the
McCoys
were
more
of
a
lower-middle-class
family
.


Ole
Ran
'
l
owned
a
farm
.


Both
families
had
also
been
involved
in
the
manufacturing
and
selling
of
illegal
moonshine
,
a
popular
commodity
at
the
time
.


The
Action
of
August
1702
was
a
naval
battle
that
took
place
from
19–25
August
1702
O.S
.


between
an
english
squadron
under
vice-admiral
john
benbow
and
a
french
under
admiral
jean
du
casse
,
off
cape
santa
marta
on
the
coast
of
present-day
colombia
,
south
america
,
during
the
war
of
the
spanish
succession
.


Benbow
vigorously
attacked
the
French
squadron
,
but
the
refusal
of
most
of
his
captains
to
support
the
action
allowed
du
Casse
to
escape
.


Benbow
lost
a
leg
during
the
engagement
and
died
of
illness
about
two
months
later
.


Two
of
the
captains
were
convicted
of
cowardice
and
shot
.


Benbow
's
resolution
to
pursue
the
French
,
in
what
proved
to
be
his
last
fight
,
proved
irresistible
to
the
public
imagination
.


The
events
of
the
fight
inspired
a
number
of
ballads
,
usually
entitled
``
Admiral
Benbow
''
or
``
Brave
Benbow
''
,
which
were
still
favourites
among
British
sailors
more
than
a
century
later
.

,
reaching
its
peak
intensity
with
winds
of
130
km/h
(
80
mph
)
early
on
August
6
.


The
storm
gradually
weakened
as
it
began
to
recurve
,
causing
it
to
parallel
the
southeastern
coast
of
Japan
.


On
August
9
,
Maria
weakened
into
a
tropical
depression
and
later
into
an
extratropical
cyclone
before
dissipating
on
August
15
.


Maria
had
only
minor
effects
in
Japan
,
mainly
heavy
rains
which
were
estimated
to
have
peaked
over
400
mm
(
15.7

on
the
Izu
Peninsula
.


One
person
was
killed
after

On
2
April
2015
,
gunmen
stormed
the
Garissa
University
College
in
Garissa
,
Kenya
,
killing
148
people
,
and
injuring
79
or
more
.


The
militant
group
and
Al-Qaeda
offshoot
,
Al-Shabaab
,
which
the
gunmen
claimed
to
be
from
,
took
responsibility
for
the
attack
.


The
gunmen
took
over
700
students
hostage
,
freeing
Muslims
and
killing
those
who
identified
as
Christians
.


The
siege
ended
the
same
day
,
when
all
four
of
the
attackers
were
killed
.


Five
men
were
later
arrested
in
connection
with
the
attack
,
and
a
bounty
was
placed
for
the
arrest
of
a
suspected
organizer
.


The
attack
was
the
deadliest
in
Kenya
since
the
1998
United
States
embassy
bombings
,
and
is
the
second
deadliest
overall
,
with
more
casualties
than
the
2002

The
attack
happened
on
22
October
2007
.


at
3:15
am
a
group
of
21
ltte
commandos
,
most
of
them
black
tigers
,
who
are
known
to
be
suicide
bombers
,
attacked
the
air
base
.


shortly
after
the
attack
started
the
tigers
were
supported
by
two
light
aircraft
from
the
air
tigers
which
conducted
a
bombing
run
on
the
base
and
escaped
undamaged
.


10
military
personnel
,
including
2
air
force
officers
,
were
killed
in
the
attack
and
22
were
wounded
.


It
was
confirmed
that
20
of
the
21
commandos
were
killed
.


also
an
air

that
was
sent
to
the
base
to
provide
help
crashed
near
the
base
during
the
clashes
killing
four
crew
members
.


Initially
it
was
reported
that
only
three
aircraft
were
destroyed
and
one
crashed
.


However
the
Prime
Minister
stated
two
days
later
that
up
to
8
aircraft
were
destroyed
in
the
attack
and
another
10
were
damaged
,
whereas
the
LTTE
claimed
to
have
destroyed
15
aircraft
on
the
day
of
the
attack
.


Because
of
this
the
sincerity
of
the
government
came
into
question
.


B.
Raman
,
a
retired
Additional
Secretary
of
India
and
currently
the
Director
of
Institute
of
Topical
Studies
of
Chennai
,
released
a
statement
regarding
the
attack
calling
that
it
``
had
been

The
2010
Trophée
des
champions
(
)
was
the
15th
edition
of
the
French
supercup
.


The
match
was
contested
by
the
winners
of
Ligue
1
the
previous
season
,
Marseille
,
and
the
winners
of
the
Coupe
de
France
the
previous
season
,
Paris
Saint-Germain
.


The

for
the
second
consecutive
season
,
on
international
soil
at
the
Stade
7
Novembre
in
Rades
,
Tunis
,
Tunisia
.


Like
last
year
,
the
idea
was
to
promote
French
football
abroad
,
but
this
time
more
specifically
in
Africa
and
the
Arab
world
.


The
match
was
televised
live
on
M6
and
throughout
53
countries
in
the
world
.


The
match
marked
the
74th
time
``
Classique
''
rivals
Marseille
and
Paris
Saint-Germain
played
against
each
other
and
was
the
second
match
,
the
first
being
the
2006
French
Cup
final
,
in
the
rivalry
's
history
to
not
be
contested
at
neither
the
Stade
Vélodrome
or
the
Parc
des
Princes
.


On
22
July
2010
,
the
Ligue
de
Football
Professionnel
and
the
Tunisian
Football
Federation
confirmed
that
international
referee
Aouaz
Trabelsi
will
officiate
the
match
.


Trabelsi
was
assisted
by
Béchir
Hassani
and
Yamen
Malloulchi
and
the
fourth
official
was
Herzi
Riadh
.


The
supercup
was
won
by
Marseille
with
the
club
defeating
PSG
5–4
on
penalties
after
the
match
finished
0–0
in
regular
time
.


The
victory
gives
Marseille
their
first
Trophée
des
champions
title
.


The
2010
edition
hosted
a
record
attendance
of
57,000
people
.


The
2015
International
Champions
Cup
(
or
ICC
)
was
a
series
of
friendly
association
football
tournaments
.


It
was
the
first
tournament
played
separately
in
Australia
,
China
and
the
United
States
.


The
Australian
edition
of
the
tournament
featured
three
teams
played
across
three
matches
at
the
Melbourne
Cricket
Ground
on
July
18
,
21
and
24
.


Real
Madrid
were
the
first
club
to
announce
their
involvement
.


Manchester
City
and
Roma
were
later
confirmed
to
take
part
in
the
Australian
tournament
.


The
Chinese
edition
of
the
tournament
featured
Real
Madrid
,
Milan
and
Inter
Milan
playing
a
total
of
three
matches
in
Shenzhen
,
Guangzhou
and
Shanghai
.


Real
Madrid
won
both
the
Australian
and
the
Chinese
competitions
.


The
North
American
edition
of
the
tournament
featured
10
teams
but
some
games
were
played
in
Mexico
,
Canada
,
Italy
and
England
.


Each
team
involved
in
the
US
edition
played
four
games
,
except
the
three
United
States-based
teams
that
only
played
two
games
.


Select
Major
League
Soccer
(
MLS
)
matches
between
the
ICC
competing
teams
counted
towards
the
point
total
to
allow
MLS
teams
to
have
four
games
count
on
the
table
.


2014
International
Champions
Cup
winners
Manchester
United
were
the
first
team
to
confirm
their
involvement
in
the
US
edition
.


The
National
Jazz
and
Blues
Festival
was
the
precursor
to
the
Reading
Rock
Festival
and
was
the
brainchild
of
Harold
Pendleton
,
the
founder
of
the
prestigious
Marquee
Club
in
Soho
.


Initially
called
The
National
Jazz
Festival
,
it
was
a
showcase
for
British
and
US
Jazz
and
was
held
at
Richmond
Athletic
Ground
in
the
sedate
London
suburb
of
Richmond
.


In
1964
the
festival
changed
its
name
to
``
The
National
Jazz
and
Blues
Festival
''
,
which
reflected
the
change
in
musical
tastes
occurring
in
Britain
in
the
early
1960s
.


Gradually
the
jazz
component
of
the
festival
was
whittled
away
and
by
1967
,
the
festival
was
featuring
the
likes
of
Cream
,
Fleetwood
Mac
and
Jeff
Beck
,
whilst
the
jazz
groups
were
relegated
to
an
afternoon
session
.


One
of
the
constants
of
the
festival
during
the
1960s
was
its
constant
search
for
a
permanent
home
:
festival
noise
and
crowds
alienated
locals
and
the
festival
moved
from
Richmond
to
Windsor
in
Berkshire
(
1966–67
)
,
to
Sunbury
in
Surrey
(
1968
)
and
then
to
Plumpton
(
1969–70
)
.


By
this
time
the
jazz
content
was
almost
non-existent
and
the
festival
was
featuring
a
mix
of
progressive
rock
,
folk
and
blues
and
drawing
crowds
of
around
30,000
.


Hurricane
Pauline
was
the
deadliest
hurricane
of
the
1968
Pacific
hurricane
season
.


Forming
from
a
disturbance
in
the
Intertropical
Convergence
Zone
on
September
26
and
becoming
a
tropical
storm
on
September
29
,
the
hurricane
strengthened
to
a
peak
of
as
a
Category
1
hurricane
on
the
Saffir-Simpson
Hurricane
Scale
on
September
30
before
making
landfall
just
east
of
La
Paz
,
Baja
California
Sur
,
near
Ciudad
Constitución
in
Mexico
,
exiting
over
the
Gulf
of
California
.


Before
making
a
second
landfall
on
the
state
of
Sonora
on
October
3
,
Pauline
lost
tropical
characteristics
.


The
storm
continued
inland
,
passing
directly
over
Ciudad
Obregón
before
dissipating
south-southeast
of
Sierra
Vista
,
Arizona
.


There
is
very
little
information
as
to
the
effects
of
Pauline
on
Mexico
,
but
during
the
passage
of
the
hurricane
over
Magdalena
Bay
,
a
boat
disappeared
with
its
five
occupants
.


Despite
a
large-scale
search
for
the
boat
or
any
possible
remnants
,
no
trace
was
ever
found
.


The
remnants
of
Pauline
triggered
showers
over
the
southwest
United
States
and
may
have
been
responsible
for
a
damaging
tornado
which
occurred
near
Glendale
,
Arizona
.


The
Ekiti
prison
break
was
an
attack
on
the
federal
prison
at
Afao
road
,
Ado
Ekiti
in
the
southwestern
Nigerian
city
of
Ekiti
State
by
60
unknown
gunmen
.


The
attack
occurred
on
30
November
2014
.


341
prisoners
escaped
from
the
prison
leaving
1
warder
and
20
sniffer
dogs
dead
.


The
escaped
prisoners
were
largely
awaiting
trial
.


10
inmates
who
attempted
to
escaped
were
captured
during
the
attack
at
gunfire
exchange
between
the
policemen
and
the
gunmen
.


67
inmates
were
rearrested
after
the
attack
and
274
inmates
escaped
.


One
inmate
,
who
claimed
to
have
run
away
when
he
heard
gunshots
,
returned
to
the
prison
to
serve
out
his
short
sentence
.


The
Battle
of
Reims
(
12–13
March
1814
)
was
fought
at
Reims
,
France
between
an
Imperial
French
army
commanded
by
Emperor
Napoleon
and
a
combined
Russian-Prussian
corps
led
by
General
Emmanuel
de
Saint-Priest
.


On
the
first
day
,
Saint-Priest
's
Russians
and
General
Friedrich
Wilhelm
von
Jagow
's
Prussians
easily
captured
Reims
from
its
French
National
Guard
garrison
,
capturing
or
killing
more
than
half
of
its
defenders
.


On
the
second
day
,
an
overconfident
Saint-Priest
carelessly
deployed
his
forces
west
of
the
city
,
not
grasping
that
Napoleon
was
approaching
with
20,000
troops
.


Too
late
,
Saint-Priest
realized
who
he
was
fighting
and
tried
to
organize
a
retreat
.


In
the
battle
that
followed
,
the
French
army
struck
with
crushing
force
and
the
Allies
were
routed
with
serious
losses
.


During
the
fighting
,
Saint-Priest
was
struck
by
a
howitzer
shell
and
died
two
weeks
later
.


The
Japanese
``
coup
d'état
''
in
French
Indochina
,
known
as
Meigo
Sakusen
(
Operation
``
Bright
Moon
''
)
,
was
a
Japanese
operation
that
took
place
on
9
March
1945
towards
the
end
of
World
War
II
.


With
Japanese
forces
losing
the
war
and
the
threat
of
an
Allied
invasion
of
Indochina
imminent
,
the
Japanese
were
concerned
about
an
uprising
against
them
by
French
colonial
forces
.


Despite
the
French
having
anticipated
an
attack
,
the
Japanese
struck
in
a
military
campaign
attacking
garrisons
all
over
the
colony
.


The
French
were
caught
off
guard
and
all
of
the
garrisons
were
overrun
with
some
then
having
to
escape
to
Nationalist
China
where
they
were
harshly
interned
.


The
Japanese
replaced
French
officials
,
and
effectively
dismantled
their
control
of
Indochina
.


The
Japanese
were
then
able
to
install
and
create
a
new
Empire
of
Vietnam
,
Kingdom
of
Kampuchea
and
Kingdom
of
Luang
Phrabang
which
under
their
direction
would
acquiesce
with
their
military
presence
and
forestall
a
potential
invasion
by
the
Allies
.


The
Polish
Coup
of
early
January
1919
was
an
unsuccessful
coup
d'etat
in
Poland
.


On
4–5
January
1919
,
right-wing
National
Democrats
attempted
to
overthrow
the
government
of
Jędrzej
Moraczewski
and
Józef
Piłsudski
.


The
coup
's
leaders
included
Marian
Januszajtis-Żegota
and
Prince
Eustachy
Sapieha
.


The
coup
forces
succeeded
in
arresting
Moraczewski
's
government
but
not
Piłsudski
.


Some
military
units
refused
to
follow
confusing
or
surprising
orders
,
and
eventually
the
coup
ended
in
some
arrests
and
in
a
return
to
the
``
status
quo
ante
''
.


There
were
no
fatalities
or
significant
injuries
.


In
mid-January
,
right-wing
activists
were
admitted
to
membership
in
a
coalition
government
.


The
Battle
of
Annan
,
known
in
the
sources
as
the
Camisade
of
Annan
took
place
on
16
December
1332
.


It
took
place
at
Annan
,
Dumfries
and
Galloway
in
Scotland
.


In
it
the
Bruce
loyalist
supporters
of
King
David
II
of
Scotland
(
son
of
Robert
the
Bruce
)
surprised
Edward
Balliol
and
his
supporters
while
they
were
in
bed
,
and
completely
threw
them
out
of
Scotland
.


The
Bruce
loyalists
were
led
by
Sir
Archibald
Douglas
,
supported
by
John
Randolph
,
3rd
Earl
of
Moray
,
the
Steward
,
the
future
Robert
II
of
Scotland
,
and
Simon
Fraser
.


Balliol
had
seized
the
Scottish
crown
after
the
Battle
of
Dupplin
Moor
(
10–11
August
1332
)
.


Robert
the
Bruce
had
died
on
7
June
1329
.


At
the
time
of
Annan
,
David
was
seven
years
old
.


The
Camp
Chapman
attack
was
a
suicide
attack
by
Humam
Khalil
Abu-Mulal
al-Balawi
against
the
Central
Intelligence
Agency
facility
inside
Forward
Operating
Base
Chapman
on
December
30
,
2009
.


One
of
the
main
tasks
of
the
CIA
personnel
stationed
at
the
base
was
to
provide
intelligence
supporting
drone
attacks
against
Pakistan
.


Seven
American
CIA
officers
and
contractors
,
an
officer
of
Jordan
's
intelligence
service
,
and
an
Afghan
working
for
the
CIA
were
killed
when
al-Balawi
detonated
a
bomb
sewn
into
a
vest
he
was
wearing
.


Six
other
American
CIA
officers
were
wounded
.


The
bombing
was
the
most
lethal
attack
against
the
CIA
in
more
than
25
years
.


Al-Balawi
was
a
Jordanian
doctor
and
jihadist
website
writer
who
was
detained
and
interrogated
over
three
days
by
the
Jordanian
intelligence
service
,
the
General
Intelligence
Directorate
(
GID
)
.


The
GID
and
the
CIA
thought
they
had
turned
al-Balawi
to
penetrate
al-Qaeda
in
the
Pakistani
tribal
areas
to
provide
intelligence
for
high-level
targets
.


Instead
,
al-Balawi
used
this
trust
to
gain
access
to
the
CIA
base
in
Afghanistan
unsearched
and
perpetrate
the
attack
.


Tehrik-i-Taliban
Pakistan
and
al-Qaeda
claimed
responsibility
,
saying
they
helped
al-Balawi
with
the
attack
.


Hurricane
Calvin
was
one
of
three
Pacific
hurricanes
on
record
to
make
landfall
along
the
Mexican
coast
during
the
month
of
July
.


The
fourth
tropical
cyclone
,
third
named
storm
,
and
second
hurricane
of
the
1993
Pacific
hurricane
season
,
Calvin
developed
from
an
area
of
convection
to
the
south
of
Mexico
on
July
4
.


The
following
day
,
the
system
intensified
into
a
tropical
storm
,
which
was
named
Calvin
.


Continued
strengthening
ensued
as
Calvin
curved
from
its
initial
westward
track
northward
,
and
was
upgraded
to
a
hurricane
on
July
6
Calvin
eventually
turned
northwest
,
and
became
a
Category
2
hurricane
on
the
Saffir–Simpson
hurricane
wind
scale
(
SSHWS
)
.


By
July
7
,
Hurricane
Calvin
made
landfall
near
Manzanillo
at
peak
strength
.


Calvin
rapidly
weakened
after
landfall
,
and
was
a
tropical
storm
when
it
reemerged
into
the
Pacific
Ocean
on
early
on
July
8
.


Despite
this
,
the
hurricane
did
not
reintensify
,
and
continued
to
weaken
as
it
headed
rapidly
northwestward
.


As
Calvin
made
a
second
Mexican
landfall
near
the
southern
tip
of
Baja
California
peninsula
late
on
July
8

Ocean
for
a
third
time
.


Calvin
was
only
the
third
July
hurricane
on
record
to
make
landfall
on
the
west
coast
of
Mexico
.


Throughout
the
nation
of
Mexico
,
Calvin
dropped
heavy
rainfall
,
especially
in
the
southwestern
portion
of
the
country
.


Heavy
rainfall
produced
flooding
,
which
,
in
turn
,
caused
mudslides
.


In
the
wake
of
Calvin
,
37
fatalities
were
reported
.


Most
of
the
casualties
were
due
to
flooding
or
car
accidents
.


In
the
state
of
Michoacán
,
700
homes
were
destroyed
.


In
addition
,
a
storm
surge
was
reported
.


Many
boats
and
shoreline
structures
from
Acapulco
to
Manzanillo
were
damaged
.


Heavy
seas
near
Lázaro
Cárdenas
in
western
Mexico
caused
a
ship
,
which
contained
sulfuric
acid
,
to
leak
.


The
cleanup
effort
took
one
month
to
complete
.


In
all
,
30,000
people
were
displaced
by
the
storm
.


Overall
,
Calvin
caused
$
32
million
(

$
)
in
damage
.

Hurricane
Ramon
was
a
very
intense
Pacific
hurricane
that
generated
heavy
rains
in
Southern
California
.


The
19th
named
storm
and
final
hurricane
of
the
above-average
1987
Pacific
hurricane
season
,
Ramon
originated
from
a
tropical
disturbance
that
formed
in
early
October
.


On
October
5
,
a
tropical
storm
had
developed
several
hundred
miles
southwest
of
Manzanillo
,
bypassing
the
tropical
depression
stage
.


tropical
storm
ramon
turned
to
the
west-northwest
after
initially
moving
west
.


It
intensified
into
a
hurricane
on
October
7
.


Two
days
later
,
Hurricane
Ramon
peaked
in
intensity
with
winds
of
140
mph
(
220
km/h
)
.


After
peaking
,
Ramon
turned
to
the
northwest
and
rapidly
weakened
over
cooler
waters
.


It
weakened
into
a
tropical
storm
on
October
11
and
a
depression
on
October
12
.


Ramon
dissipated
shortly
thereafter
.


While
at
sea
,
Ramon
brought
light
rainfall
to
the
Baja
California
Peninsula
.


The
remnants
of
Hurricane
Ramon
produced
heavy
rainfall
that
caused
flooding
in
California
,
indirectly
contributing
to
five
traffic-related
fatalities
.


Rainfall
was
reported
as
far
inland
as
Utah
.


Hurricane
Betsy
was
an
intense
and
destructive
tropical
cyclone
that
brought
widespread
damage
to
areas
of
Florida
and
the
central
United
States
Gulf
Coast
in
September
1965
.


The
storm
's
erratic
nature
,
coupled
with
its
intensity
and
minimized
preparation
time
contributed
to
making
Betsy
the
first
tropical
cyclone
in
the
Atlantic
basin
to
accrue
at
least
$
1
billion
in
damage
.


While
the
storm
primarily
affected
areas
of
southern
Florida
and
Louisiana
,
lesser
effects
were
felt
in
the
Bahamas
and
as
far
inland
in
the
United
States
as
the
Ohio
River
Valley
.


Betsy
began
as
a
tropical
depression
north
of
French
Guiana
on
August
27
,
and
strengthened
as
it
moved
in
a
general
northwesterly
direction
.


After
executing
a
slight
anticyclonic
loop
north
of
the
Bahamas
,
Betsy
proceeded
to
move
through
areas
of
south
Florida
on
September
8
,
causing
extensive
crop
damage
.


After
emerging
into
the
Gulf
of
Mexico
,
the
cyclone
strengthened
and
reached
its
peak
intensity
equivalent
to
that
of
a
Category
4
hurricane
on
September
10
before
making
its
final
landfall
near
Grand
Isle
,
Louisiana
,
shortly
thereafter
.


Once
inland
,
Betsy
was
slow
to
weaken
,
and
persisted
for
two
more
days
before
degenerating
into
an
extratropical
storm
;
these
remnants
lasted
until
September
13
.


As
a
developing
tropical
cyclone
,
Betsy
tracked
over
the
northern
Leeward
Islands
,
producing
moderate
gusts
and
slight
rainfall
,
though
only
minimal
damage
was
reported
.


After
tracking
over
open
waters
for
several
days
,
Betsy
had
significantly
strengthened
upon
moving
through
the
Bahamas
.


There
,
considerable
damage
occurred
,
particularly
to
crops
on
the
archipelago
's
islands
.


For
the
island
chain
,
Betsy
was
considered
the
worst
hurricane
since
a
tropical
cyclone
impacted
the
region
in
1929
.


Widespread
power
outage
and
property
damage
ensued
due
to
the
storm
's
strong
winds
.


Overall
,
damage
on
the
Bahamas
amounted
to
at
least
$
14
million
,
and
one
fatality
occurred
.


From
there
Betsy
tracked
westward
and
made
landfall
on
southern
Florida
,
where
it
was
considered
the
worst
tropical
cyclone
since
a
hurricane
in
1926
.


Betsy
's
strong
storm
surge
inundated
large
portions
of
the
Florida
Keys
,
flooding
streets
and
causing
widespread
damage
.


The
only
route
out
of
the
Keys
onto
the
mainland
was
cut
off
by
the
storm
.


In
the
state
alone
,
Betsy
caused
$
139
million
in
damage
and
five
deaths
.


Betsy
's
most
severe
impacts
were
felt
in
Louisiana
,
where
it
made
landfall
as
a
powerful
Category
4
hurricane
.


The
cyclone
propelled
damaging
storm
surge
into
Lake
Pontchartrain
,
breaching
levees
in
New
Orleans
and
inundating
several
neighborhoods
,
most
notably
the
lower
Ninth
Ward
.


Strong
winds
caused
widespread
power
and
telecommunications
outages
across
the
region
.


Further
inland
,
effects
wrought
by
Betsy
were
considerably
weaker
,
though
precipitation
caused
by
the
storm
extended
as
far
northeast
as
Pennsylvania
.


Rainfall
was
primarily
beneficial
in
Arkansas
,
though
localized
flooding
impacted
rice
and
cotton
crops
.


In
Kentucky
and
Illinois
,
strong
winds
caused
moderate
property
damage
.


By
the
time
the
remnants
of
Betsy
moved
into
the
northeastern
United
States
,
the
storm
's
winds
and
rainfall
had
substantially
lessened
,
and
as
such
resulting
wind
damage
was
negligible
while
precipitation
benefited
crops
.


In
total
,
the
damage
wrought
by
Betsy
throughout
its
existence
equated
to
roughly
$
1.43
billion
,
making
it
the
costliest
Atlantic
hurricane
at
the
time
.


In
addition
the
hurricane
caused
81
deaths
,
primarily
in
Louisiana
.


After
the
season
,
the
United
States
Weather
Bureau
retired
the
name
Betsy
from
their
rotating
lists
of
tropical
cyclone
names
.

,
Isa
developed
from
a
disturbance
in
the
monsoon
trough
near
the
Caroline

on
April
12
.


It
moved

season
,
Chris
developed
from
a
tropical
wave
while
roughly
midway
between

.


Thereafter
,
the
system
tracked
rapidly
north-northwestward
and
came
ashore
near
Savannah
,
Georgia
later
that
day
.


Once
inland
,
Chris
quickly
weakened
,
and
by
early
on
the
following
day
,
it
weakened
to
a
tropical
depression
over
South
Carolina
.


Six
hours
later
,
Chris
was
absorbed
by
a
cold
front
while
over
North
Carolina
,
though
the
remnants
of
the
system
tracked
across
the
Eastern
United
States
and
Atlantic
Canada
before
dissipating
on
August
30
.


In
the
Leeward
Islands
and
U.S.
Virgin
Islands
,
Chris
produced
only
light
rainfall
,
that
caused
no
damage
or
fatalities
.


Heavy
rainfall
occurred
in
Puerto

,
which
damaged
100
homes
and
caused
three
fatalities
.


Large
amounts
of
precipitation
also
fell
in
Hispaniola
,
though
no
damage
was
reported
.


In
the
United
States
,
much
of
the
damage
occurred
due
to
tornadoes
,
especially
in
The
Carolinas
.


A
tornado
in

.


The
twenty-fourth
tropical
depression
and
eighteenth
named
storm
,
Rachel
developed
on
September
27
from
a
tropical
wave
southwest
of
mainland
Mexico
.


After
becoming
a
tropical
depression
,
the
system
tracked
slowly
southwestward
and
eventually
curved
northwestward
.


The
depression
intensified
into
a
tropical
storm
after
three
days
and
was
named
``
Rachel
''
by
the
National
Hurricane
Center
.


Rachel
continued
to
steadily
strengthen
,
and
peaked
as
a
strong

Hurricane
Michael
of
the
2000
Atlantic
hurricane
season
caused
moderate
damage
in
Atlantic
Canada
.


The
seventeenth
tropical
cyclone
,
thirteenth
named
storm
,
and
eighth
hurricane
of
the
season
,
Michael
developed
from
a
non-tropical
system
to
the
southwest
of
Bermuda
on
October
15
.


The
system
was
initially
subtropical
,
but
rapidly
acquired
tropical
characteristics
by
October
17
.


Michael
quickly
strengthened
into
a
hurricane
later
that
day
.


By
October
20
,
Michael
peaked
as
a
Category
2
hurricane
on
the
Saffir-Simpson
hurricane
wind
scale
at
a
relatively
high
latitude
of
44°N
.


The
storm
weakened
slightly
to
a
Category
1
hurricane
and
became
extratropical
shortly
before
making
landfall
in
Newfoundland
on
October
20
.


As
the
intensity
of
Michael
was
equivalent
to
a
Category
1
hurricane
during
landfall
,
high
winds
were
reported
throughout
Atlantic
Canada
,
especially
in

and
could
be
felt
strongly
in
Mexico
City

The
torrential
rains
preceding
and
following
the
temblor
intensified
the
damage
of
this
earthquake
.


Thirty-five
people
were
reported
dead
.


The
archeological
site
of
the
ancient
Zapotec
city
of

with
a
normal-faulting
mechanism
.


The
fault
plane
was
90
km
long
and
45
km
wide

Typhoon
Etau
,
known
in
the
Philippines
as
Typhoon
Kabayan
,
produced
near-record
winds
and
rainfall
in
Japan
in
August
2003

The
tenth
named
storm
and
fifth
typhoon
of
the
2003
Pacific
typhoon
season
,
Etau
developed
on
August
2
,
and
gradually
intensified
while
moving
to
the
northwest
.


Etau
formed
an
eye
and
became
a
large
storm
by
the
time
it
approached
Okinawa
on
August
7
.


The
typhoon
attained
peak
winds
of
155
km/h
(
100
mph
)
before
weakening
slightly
while
turning
to
the
northeast
.


Etau
made
landfall
on
the
Japanese
island
of
Shikoku
on
August
8
,
and
later
moved
across
portions
of
Honshu
and
Hokkaido
.


After
weakening
to
tropical
storm
status
,
the
cyclone
became
extratropical
on
August
9
and
dissipated
three
days
later
.


While
passing
northeast
of
the
Philippines
,
the
typhoon
caused
light
damage
in
the
archipelago
.


The
eye
crossed
over
Okinawa
,
where
Etau
left
166,800
people
without
power
and
caused
10
injuries
.


Near
where
Etau
first
struck
Japan
,
Muroto
reported
a
peak
wind
gust
of
166
km/h
(
103

)
,
at
the
time
the
third
strongest
on
record
there
.


The
typhoon
also
dropped

The
combination
of
winds
and
rainfall
caused
landslides
,
particularly
on
Hokkaido
.


Nationwide

The
1966
Sarawak
constitutional
crisis
took
place
in
the
state
of
Sarawak
,
Malaysia
from
1965
to
1966
.


This
crisis
was
started
by
a
group
of
politicians
who
were
dissatisfied
towards
Stephen
Kalong
Ningkan
's
leadership
as
chief
minister
.


Ningkan
was
later
removed
from
the
chief
minister
post
by
the
Governor
of
Sarawak
in
June
1966
.


However
,
Ningkan
was
reinstated
by
the
High
Court
in
early
September
1966
.


He
was
ousted
from
the
chief
minister
office
for
the
final
time
at
the
end
of
September
1966
and
was
replaced
by
Tawi
Sli
as
the
new
chief
minister
.


It
was
widely
believed
that
the
ouster
of
Ningkan
was
a
result
of
interference
by
the
Malaysian
federal
government
due
to
him
being
a
strong
advocate
of
greater
state
autonomy
.

alongside
athletics

which
featured
five
track

had
gradually
evolved
to
include

to
arrive
at
the
current
eighteen
events
.


In
February
2013
,
the
International
Cycling
Union
(
UCI
)
announced
its
intention
to
petition
the
IOC
to
extend
the

2013
the
IOC
stated
that
the

programme
will
be
the
same
as

The
2007
Greek
forest
fires
were
a
series
of
massive
forest
fires
that
broke
out
in
several
areas
across
Greece
throughout
the
summer
of
2007
.


The
most
destructive
and
lethal
infernos
broke
out
on
23
August
,
expanded
rapidly
and
raged
out
of
control
until
27
August
,
until
they
were
put
out
in
early
September
.


The
fires
mainly
affected
western
and
southern
Peloponnese
as
well
as
southern
Euboea
.


The
death
toll
in
August
alone
stood
at
67
people
.


In
total
84
people
lost
their
lives
because
of
the
fires
,
including
several
fire
fighters
.


Some
of
these
firestorms
are
believed
to
be
the
result
of
arson
while
others
were
merely
the
result
of
negligence
.


Hot
temperatures
,
including
three
consecutive
heat
waves
of
over
40
°C
(
105
°F
)
,
and
severe
drought
rendered
the
2007
summer
unprecedented
in
modern
Greek
history
.


From
the
end
of
June
to
early
September
,
over
3,000
forest
fires
were
recorded
across
the
nation
.


Nine
more
people
were
killed
in
blazes
in
June
and
July
.


A
total
of
2,700
square
kilometers
(
670,000
acres
)
of
forest
,
olive
groves
and
farmland
were
destroyed
in
the
fires
,
which
was
the
worst
fire
season
on
record
in
the
past
50
years
.


Of
the
total
of
2,700
km²
,
1,500
km²
(
370,000
acres
)
were
burnt
forests
in
Southern
Greece
alone
.


Many
buildings
were
also
destroyed
in
the
blaze
.


The
fire
destroyed
1,000
houses
and
1,100
other
buildings

Electric
Picnic
is
an
annual
arts-and-music
festival
which
has
been
staged
since
2004
at
Stradbally
Hall
in
Stradbally
,
County
Laois
,
Ireland
.


It
is
organised
by
Pod
Concerts
and
Festival
Republic
,
who
purchased
the
majority
shareholding
in
2009
.


It
was
voted
Best
Medium-Sized
European
Festival
at
the
2010
European
Festival
Awards
,
and
has
been
voted
Best
Big
Festival
at
each
of
the
last
four
Irish
Festival
Awards
since
they
began
in
2007
.


The
Picnic
has
been
described
as
``
Ireland
's
version
of
Glastonbury
''
and
``
a
great
inspiration
to
Latitude
''
by
one
of
its
business
partners
,
Laois
.


US
magazine
``
Billboard
''
calling
it
as
``
a
magnificent
rock
n
roll
circus
,
a
textbook
example
of
everything
a
festival
should
be
''
and
``
Rolling
Stone
''
describing
it
as
``
one
of
the
best
festivals
we
've
ever
been
to
''
.


The
2008
event
was
described
by
``
The
Irish
Times
''
as
``
the
best
Electric
Picnic
yet
''
.


Electric
Picnic
differs
from
other
festivals
in
Ireland
in
that
the
music
choice
is
more
eclectic
than
the
other
mainstream
events
(
its
history
includes
international
acts
such
as
Kraftwerk
,
Röyksopp
,
Nick
Cave
,
Sonic
Youth
,
New
Order
,
Björk
,
Arcade
Fire
,
Beastie
Boys
,
The
Stooges
,
The
Chemical
Brothers
,
Gary
Numan
,
The
Flaming
Lips
,
Sigur
Rós
and
Sex
Pistols
)
,
and
there
is
more
emphasis
on
quality
festival
services
(
such
as
food
and
sleeping
arrangements
)
and
a
generally
more
positive
and
relaxed
atmosphere
.


There
is
also
an
emphasis
on
eco-friendly
initiatives
.


Electric
Picnic
began
as
a
one-day
event
in
2004
,
before
growing
to
a
weekend-long
festival
within
a
year
.


The
festival
incorporates
attractions
such
as
the
24-hour
cinema
tent
,
the
Body
and
Soul
arena
(
offering
an
ambient
lounge
with
beanbags
,
massages
and
tarot
card
readings
)
and
the
Comedy
Tent
(
curated
by
Gerry
Mallon
)
and
a
silent
disco
.


In
2008
,
Amnesty
International
attended
the
festival
to
celebrate
the
60th
anniversary
of
the
Universal
Declaration
of
Human
Rights
,
whilst
renowned
American
Burning
Man
artist
,
David
Best
constructed
a
Temple
of
Truth
on
site
.


Electric
Picnic
has
been
described
as
an
``
enormously
successful
,
award-winning
,
established
brand
''
which
``
attempts
to
bring
to
life
a
microcosmic
cultural
experience
where
music
is
just
the
tip
of
the
iceberg

The
Japanese
invasion
of
Manchuria
began
on
18
September
1931
,
when
the
Kwantung
Army
of
the
Empire
of
Japan
invaded
Manchuria
immediately
following
the
Mukden
Incident
.


After
the
war
,
the
Japanese
established
the
puppet
state
of
Manchukuo
.


Their
occupation
lasted
until
the
Soviet
Union
and
Mongolia
launched
the
Manchurian
Strategic
Offensive
Operation
in
1945
.


The
South
Manchuria
railway
zone
and
the
Korean
Peninsula
were
already
under
the
control
of
the
Japanese
empire
since
the
Russo-Japanese
War
of
1904
.


Japan
's
ongoing
industrialization
and
militarization
ensured
their
growing
dependence
on
oil
and
metal
imports
from
the
US
.


The
US
sanctions
which
prevented
trade
with
the
United
States
(
which
had
occupied
the
Philippines
around
the
same
time
)
resulted
in
Japan
furthering
their
expansion
in
the
territory
of
China
and
Southeast
Asia
.


The
invasion
is
sometimes
cited
as
an
alternative
starting
date
for
World
War
II
,
in
contrast
with
the
more
commonly-accepted
one
of
September
1939
.


On
4
March
2012
,
a
series
of
blasts
occurred
at
an
army
arms
dump
in
Brazzaville
,
the
capital
of
the
Republic
of
the
Congo
.


At
least
250
people
were
killed
by
the
explosions
.


Additional
bodies
were
said
to
be
``
unfindable
.
''


among
the
dead
were
six
chinese
workers
from
a
beijing
construction
engineering
group
work
site
close
to
the
armoury
.


Interior
Minister
Raymond
Mboulou
said
that
nearby
hospitals
were
overflowing
with
injuries
,
with
many
wounded
lying
in
hallways
due
to
lack
of
space
.


Total
injuries
exceeded
2,300
.


More
than
13,800
people
were
left
homeless
.


One
survivor
described
the
event
as
feeling
like
``
the
apocalypse
;
''
others
described
it
as
``
like
a
tsunami
''
or
earthquake
.


The
Armory
Show
,
also
known
as
the
International
Exhibition
of
Modern
Art
,
was
a
show
organized
by
the
Association
of
American
Painters
and
Sculptors
in
1913
.


It
was
the
first
large
exhibition
of
modern
art
in
America
,
as
well
as
one
of
the
many
exhibitions
that
have
been
held
in
the
vast
spaces
of
U.S.
National
Guard
armories
.


The
three-city
exhibition
started
in
New
York
City
's
69th
Regiment
Armory
,
on
Lexington
Avenue
between
25th
and
26th
Streets
,
from
February
17
until
March
15
,
1913
.


The
exhibition
went
on
to
show
at
the
Art
Institute
of
Chicago
and
then
to
The
Copley
Society
of
Art
in
Boston
,
where
,
due
to
a
lack
of
space
,
all
the
work
by
American
artists
was
removed
.


The
show
became
an
important
event
in
the
history
of
American
art
,
introducing
astonished
Americans
,
who
were
accustomed
to
realistic
art
,
to
the
experimental
styles
of
the
European
avant
garde
,
including
Fauvism
,
Cubism
,
and
Futurism
.


The
show
served
as
a
catalyst
for
American
artists
,
who
became
more
independent
and
created
their
own
``
artistic
language
.
''


The
origins
of
the
show
lie
in
the
emergence
of
progressive
groups
and
independent
exhibitions
in
the
early
20th
century
(
with
significant
French
precedents
)
,
which
challenged
the
aesthetic
ideals
,
exclusionary
policies
,
and
authority
of
the
National
Academy
of
Design
,
while
expanding
exhibition
and
sales
opportunities
,
enhancing
public
knowledge
,
and
enlarging
audiences
for
contemporary
art
.

The
Second
Battle
of
Deep
Bottom
,
also
known
as
Fussell
's
Mill
(
particularly
in
the
South
)
,
New
Market
Road
,
Bailey
's
Creek
,
Charles
City
Road
,
or
White
's
Tavern
was
fought
August
14–20
,
1864
,
at
Deep
Bottom
in
Henrico
County
,
Virginia
,
during
the
Richmond-Petersburg
Campaign
(
Siege
of
Petersburg
)
of
the
American
Civil
War
.


During
the
night
of
August
13–14
,
a
force
under
the
command
of
Maj.
Gen.
Winfield
S.
Hancock
crossed
the
James
River
at
Deep
Bottom
to
threaten
Richmond
and
attract
Confederate
forces
away
from
the
Petersburg
,
Virginia
,
trenches
and
the
Shenandoah
Valley
.


On
August
14
,
the
X
Corps
closed
on
New
Market
Heights
while
the
II
Corps
extended
the
Federal
line
to
the
right
along
Bailey
's
Creek
.


During
the
night
,
the
X
Corps
was
moved
to
the
right
flank
of
the
Union
line
near
Fussell
's
Mill
.


On
August
16
,
Union
assaults
near
the
mill
were
initially
successful
,
but
Confederate
counterattacks
drove
the
Federals
back
.

days
of
indecisive
skirmishing
,
the
Federals
returned
to
the
south
side
of
the
James
on
the
night
of
August
20
.


The
Confederates
achieved
their
objective
of
driving
back
the
Union
threat
,
but
at
a
cost
of
diluting
their
forces
as
the
Union
had
hoped
.

super
cyclonic
storm
gonu
is
the
strongest
tropical
cyclone
on
record
in
the
arabian
sea
,
and
is
also
the
strongest
named
cyclone
in
the
northern
indian
ocean
.


The
second
named
tropical
cyclone
of
the
2007
North
Indian
Ocean
cyclone
season
,
Gonu
developed
from
a
persistent
area
of
convection
in
the
eastern
Arabian
Sea
on
June
1
,
2007
.


With
a
favorable
upper-level
environment
and
warm
sea
surface
temperatures
,
it
rapidly
intensified
to
attain
peak
winds
of
235
km/h
(
145
mph
)
on
June
4
,
according
to
the
India
Meteorological
Department
.


Gonu
weakened
after
encountering
dry
air
and
cooler
waters
,
and
early
on
June
6
,
it
made
landfall
on
the
easternmost
tip
of
Oman
,
becoming
the
strongest
tropical
cyclone
to
hit
the
Arabian
Peninsula
.


It
then
turned
northward
into
the
Gulf
of
Oman
,
and
dissipated
on
June
7
,
after
making
landfall
in
southern
Iran
,
the
first
landfall
in
the
country
since
1898
.


Intense
tropical
cyclones
like
Gonu
are
extremely
rare
in
the
Arabian
Sea
,
and
most
storms
in
this
area
tend
to
be
small
and
dissipate
quickly
.


The
cyclone
caused
50
deaths
and
about
$
4.2
billion
in
damage
(
2007
USD
)
in
Oman
,
where
the
cyclone
was
considered
the
nation
's
worst
natural
disaster
.


Gonu
dropped
heavy
rainfall
near
the
eastern
coastline
,
reaching
up
to
610
mm
(
24
inches
)
,
which
caused
flooding
and
heavy
damage
.

Hurricane
Hilda
was
the
most
intense
tropical
cyclone
of
the
1964
Atlantic
hurricane
season
and
ravaged
areas
of
the
United
States
Gulf
Coast
,
particularly
Louisiana
.


In
addition
to
its
damage
inland
,
the
hurricane
greatly
disrupted
offshore
oil
production
,
and
at
its
time
was
the
costliest
tropical
cyclone
for
Louisiana
's
offshore
oil
production
.


due
in
part
to
flights
made
by
the
national
hurricane
research
laboratory
,
hilda
became
one
of
the
most
well-documented
storms
meteorologically
in
the
atlantic
.


Lasting
for
seven
days
as
a
tropical
cyclone
,
Hilda
caused
US
$
126
million
in
damage
and
38
deaths
.


Hilda
developed
over
the
southern
shores
of
Cuba
on
September
28
as
a
tropical
depression
,
tracking
westward
in
an
area
of
favorable
conditions
and
reaching
tropical
storm
intensity
the
next
day
.


Once
situated
in
the
Gulf
of
Mexico
,
Hilda
strengthened
into
a
hurricane
and
began
a
slow
trawl
northward
,
rapidly
intensifying
to
its
peak
intensity
with
winds
of
150
mph
(
240
km/h
)
on
October
1
,
making
it
a
Category
4
hurricane
equivalent
.


Slight
weakening
occurred
as
Hilda
made
landfall
on
the
southern
Louisiana
coast
on
October
3
.


After
reaching
land
,
the
hurricane
took
a
sharp
turn
eastward
and
rapidly
weakened
as
a
result
of
land
interaction
and
the
presence
of
cool
,
dry
air
.


The
weakened
remnants
of
Hilda
merged
with
a
cold
front
a
day
after
landfall
and
dissipated
on
October
5
.


Originating
near
Cuba
,
the
cyclone
intensified
while
moving
through
the
Gulf
of
Mexico
,
and
became
a
Category
4
hurricane
in
the
Gulf
of
Mexico
before
striking
Louisiana
in
early
October
.


In
combination
with
a
frontal
zone
located
across
the
Southeast
United
States
,
the
hurricane
spread
heavy
rains
through
the
South
through
the
Carolinas
into
the
Mid-Atlantic
States
.


Hilda
led
to
significant
damage
to
oil
platforms
in
the
Gulf
of
Mexico
,
as
well
as
$
126
million
(

The
1999
championship
was
nicknamed
``
Carnastie
''
due
to
how

were
.


Jean

the
hole
and
went
to
a
four-hole
playoff
with
Lawrie

Lawrie
prevailed
.


Watson

Copenhagen
accident
was
the
crash
of
a
KLM
Royal
Dutch
Airlines
flight
from
Amsterdam
to
Stockholm
via
Copenhagen
on
26
January
.


The
accident
occurred
shortly
after
the
Douglas
DC-3
took
off
from
Kastrup
in
Denmark
.


All
22
passengers
and
crew
on
board
were
killed
in
the
accident
.


Among
those
killed
in

throne
)
,
U.S.

the
present
king
of
Sweden
Carl
XVI
Gustaf
.


A
hundred
thousand
people
attended
the
funeral
.


Moore
's
body
was
flown
to

KLM
aircraft
,
and
she
was
buried
on
3
February
1947
with
more
than
500
people
in
attendance
.


The
probable
cause
of
the
crash
was
determined
to
be
failure
to
remove
the
gust
locks
that
had
secured
the
aircraft
's
elevators
while
it
was
parked
.


It

Ignacio
developed
out
of
a
tropical

.


It
was
initially
predicted
to

The
Cold
wave
of
January
1977
produced
the
only
known
trace
of
snow
in
the
greater
Miami
area
of
Florida
ever
reported
,
although
the
city
itself
did
not
report
any
snow
(
a
trace
of
snow
was
documented
in
Lake
Worth
)
.


It
occurred
following
the
passage
of
a
strong
cold
front
,
in
combination
with
a
high-pressure
area
situated
over
the
Mississippi
River
Valley
.


As
a
result
,
cold
air
moved
far
to
the
south
across
Florida
,
causing
both
snow
flurries
and
record
low
temperatures
.


Most
notably
,
the
weather
system
brought
snow
flurries
(
seen
in
the
air
,
but
not
on
the
ground
)
as
far
south
as
Homestead
on
January
19
.


No
snow
had
ever
been
reported
in
southeastern
Florida
before
or
since
.


Damage
was
most
significant
to
agriculture
,
as
major
losses
occurred
to
Citrus
fruits
and
tender
vegetables
.


Statewide
,
agricultural
damage
from
the
cold
wave
totaled
to
$
350
million
(

USD
)
,
and
losses
overall
totaled
to
$
2
billion
(
1977
USD
)

The
Action
of
9
August
1780
was
a
naval
engagement
of
the
Anglo-Spanish
War
,
in
which
a
Spanish
fleet
,
led
by
Admiral
Luis
de
Córdova
y
Córdova
,
along
with
a
squadron
of
French
ships
,
encountered
a
large
British
convoy
.


The
Spanish
and
French
force
captured
almost
all
the
British
vessels
,
which
dealt
a
severe
blow
to
the
commerce
of
Great
Britain
.


The
British
convoy
,
escorted
by
(
74
guns
,
under
Captain
Sir
John
Moutray
)
and
two
frigates
-
``
Thetis
''
(
36
guns
)
and
``
Southampton
''
(
36
guns
)
,
sailed
from
Portsmouth
on
27
July
.


On
9
August
,
they
encountered
the
Spanish
fleet
.


The
Spaniards
captured
55
of
the
63
British
merchant
vessels
,
making
it
one
of
the
most
complete
naval
captures
ever
made
.


The
British
lost
80,000
muskets
,
equipment
for
40,000
troops
,
294
cannons
(
the
normal
British
troop
size
during
the
American
Independence
War
was
40,000
troops
)
,
and
3,144
men
.


The
financial
impact
of
the
losses
were
estimated
to
be
around
£1,500,000
(
£1,000,000
in
gold
and
£500,000
–
£600,000
in
equipment
and
ships
)
.


The
action
also
helped
to
derail
a
secret
British
diplomatic
effort
to
make
peace
with
Spain
.


The
loss
was
still
bitterly
remembered
in
Great
Britain
30
years
later

the
height
of
the
Napoleonic
Wars

Lake
(
)

western
half
of
the
Second
Phase
Campaign
resulted
in
a
Chinese
victory
in
the
Battle
of
the

The
battle
took
place
about
a
month
after
the
People
's
Republic
of
China
entered
the
conflict
and
sent
the
People
's
Volunteer
Army
(
PVA
)
9th
Army
to
infiltrate
the
northeastern
part
of

Reservoir
area
.


A
brutal
17-day
battle
in

weather
soon
followed
.


Between

November
and
13
December
,
30,000
United
Nations
Command
troops
(
later
nicknamed
``
The
Chosin
Few
''
)
under
the
field
command
of
Major
General
Oliver
P.
Smith
were
encircled
and
attacked
by
about
120,000
Chinese
troops
under
the
command
of
Song
Shilun
,
who
had
been
ordered
by
Mao
Zedong
to
destroy
the
UN
forces
.


The
UN
forces
were
nevertheless
able
to
break
out
of
the
encirclement
and
to
make
a
fighting
withdrawal
to
the
port
of
Hungnam
,
inflicting
heavy
casualties
on
the
Chinese
.

In
615
,
during
the
ongoing
war
with
the
Byzantine
Empire
,
the
Sassanid
Persian
army
under
spahbod
Shahin
invaded
Asia
Minor
and
reached
Chalcedon
,
across
the
Bosporus
from
Constantinople
.


It
was
at
this
point
,
according
to
Sebeos
,
that
Heraclius
had
agreed
to
stand
down
and
was
about
ready
to
become
a
client
of
the
Sasanian
emperor
Khosrow
II
,
allowing
the
Roman
Empire
to
become
a
Persian
client
state
,
as
well
as
even
allow
Khosrow
II
to
choose
the
emperor
.


The
Sassanids
had
already
captured
Roman
Syria
and
Palestine
in
the
previous
year
.


After
negotiations
with
Byzantine
Emperor
Heraclius
,
a
Byzantine
ambassador
was
sent
to
Persian
Shahanshah
Khosrau
II
,
and
Shahin
withdrew
again
to
Syria
.


This
was
not
the
first
time
the
Persians
drew
up
their
armies
at
the
walls
of
Constantinople
,
but
this
time
the
invasion
was
more
widespread
.


Beginning
in
614
the
Persians
encroached
on
Asia
Minor
.


In
614
they
captured
Melitene
and
Shahin
divided
his
armies
in
two
,
one
army
marching
to
sack
Sardis
and
Miletus
and
his
army
move
towards
Chalcedon
.


Despite
the
successful
retreat
back
to
Syria
,
the
Persians
did
keep
Caesarea
(
modern
Kayseri
)
and
the
key
Armenian
fortresses
of
Theodosiopolis
(
modern
Erzurum
)
and
Martyropolis
.


According
to
Sebeos
,

The
Second
Battle
of
Târgu
Frumos
,
part
of
the
First
Jassy-Kishinev
Offensive
,
was
a
military
engagement
primarily
between
the
Wehrmacht
and
Red
Army
forces
in
May
1944
,
near
Iași
,
Romania
.


Military
historian
David
Glantz
claims
the
battle
resulted
from
a
Stavka
order
to
the
forces
of
the
2nd
&
3rd
Ukrainian
Fronts
to
commence
a
coordinated
invasion
of
Romania
.


It
was
directed
towards
Iași
with
a
secondary
objective
of
establishing
bridgeheads
across
the
Prut
river
.


The
battle
was
only
briefly
described
by
Soviet
historians
.


Recently
,
Russian
historians
have
begun
describing
this
as
a
distinct
battle
.


For
example
,
the
four
volume
``
Great
Patriotic
War
''
(
1998
)
prepared
for
the
Russian
Federation
states
:
Thus
,
during
the
Târgu-Frumos
operation
,
the
2nd
Ukrainian
Front
's
forces
tried
unsuccessfully
to
complete
a
deep
penetration
of
the
enemy
's
defense
and
reach
the
territory
between
the
Prut
&
Seret
Rivers
.


By
order
of
the
Stavka
,
they
themselves
went
over
to
the
defensive
along
existing
lines
on
6
May
...


The
several
attempts
by
the
3rd
Ukrainian
Front
's
armies
to
conduct
attacks
from
their
Dnestr
bridgeheads
&
seize
new
bridgeheads
also
led
to
nothing
.


According
to

von
Manteuffel
,
one
of
the
two
German
division
commanders
,
and

und

the
German
forces
defeated
a
Soviet
offensive
by
the
2nd

Front

,
struck
in

The
Siege
of
Port
Royal
(
5
–
13
October
1710
)
,
also
known
as
the
Conquest
of
Acadia
,
was
a
military
siege
conducted
by
British
regular
and
provincial
forces
under
the
command
of
Francis
Nicholson
against
a
French
Acadian
garrison
and
the
Wabanaki
Confederacy
under
the
command
of
Daniel
d'Auger
de
Subercase
,
at
the
Acadian
capital
,
Port
Royal
.


The
successful
British
siege
marked
the
beginning
of
permanent
British
control
over
the
peninsular
portion
of
Acadia
,
which
they
renamed
Nova
Scotia
,
and
it
was
the
first
time
the
British
took
and
held
a
French
colonial
possession
.


After
the
French
surrender
,
the
British
occupied
the
fort
in
the
capital
with
all
the
pomp
and
ceremony
of
having
captured
one
of
the
great
fortresses
of
Europe
,
and
renamed
it
Annapolis
Royal
.


The
siege
was
the
third
British
attempt
during
Queen
Anne
's
War
to
capture
the
Acadian
capital
,
and
it
had
profound
consequences
over
the
next
50
years
.


The
conquest
was
a
key
element
in
the
framing
of
the
North
American
issues
in
French-British
treaty
negotiations
of
1711–1713
.


It
resulted
in
the
creation
of
a
new
colony—Nova
Scotia—and
introduced
significant
questions
concerning
the
fate
of
both
the
Acadians
and
the
Mi'kmaq
who
continued
to
occupy
Acadia
.


The
Conquest
of
Acadia
was
a
foundational
moment
in
the
history
of
the
Canadian
state—it
was
a
precursor
to
the
British
conquests
of
Louisbourg
and
Quebec
in
the
middle
of
the
century
.

The

earthquake
was
among
the
deadliest
earthquakes
in
history

name
was
taken

city
of

where
the
most
casualties
were
sustained

preceded
by
a
smaller
quake
on
the
10th
.


It

frequently
listed
as
the
third
deadliest
earthquake
in
history
,
following
on
from
the
Shensi
and
Tangshan
earthquakes
in
China
.


However
,
the
figure
of
230,000
dead
is
based
on
a
historical
conflation
of
this
earthquake
with
earthquakes
in
November
1137
on
the
Jazira
plain
and
the
large
seismic
event
of
30
September
1139

mention
of

death
toll
was
by
Ibn
Taghribirdi
in

caught
fire
and
was
destroyed
during

there
were
36
fatalities
(
13
passengers
and
22
crewmen
,
1
worker
on

ground
)
.


The
disaster
was
the
subject
of
newsreel
coverage
,

,
and
Herbert
Morrison
's
recorded
radio
eyewitness
reports
from
the
landing
field
,
which
were
broadcast
the
next

A
variety
of
hypotheses
have
been
put
forward
for
both
the
cause
of
ignition
and
the
initial
fuel
for
the
ensuing
fire
.


The
event
shattered

confidence
in

season
of

top
club
rugby
union
competition
.


The
match
was
played
on

May

in
Edinburgh
;
this
was
the
second
time

after

18–12
after

.


The
match
was
contested
by

Tigers
of
England
and

of
Ireland
.


While
Leinster
were
making
their
first
appearance
in
the
Heineken

final
,
Leicester
were
playing
in
their
fifth
,
having
won
the
competition
twice
,
though
not
since

;
they
did
,
however
,
finish

won
the
match
19–16
;
Leinster
took

then
moved
9–3
ahead
with
a
drop
goal
from
the
halfway
line
and
a
penalty
from
Jonathan
Sexton
.


However
,
after
Stan
Wright
was
sin-binned
on
the
half-hour
mark
for
an
off-the-ball
challenge
on
Sam
Vesty
,
Leicester
reduced
the
deficit
to
three
points
with
another
Dupuy
penalty
,
before
taking
a
13–9
half-time
lead
via
a
converted
try
from

Woods
.


Dupuy
increased
Leicester
's
lead
to
seven
points
with
a
third
penalty
goal
just
after
the
interval
,
but
a
converted
try
from
Jamie
Heaslip
brought
the
teams
level
with
half
an
hour
left
to
play
.


Then
,
with
ten
minutes
left
on
the
clock
,
Jonathan
Sexton
squeezed
a
penalty
inside
the
right-hand
upright
to
win
the
match
for

annual
music
festival
organised
by
event
management
company
DNA
Networks
in
conjunction
with
Nous
Productions
at
the
Palace
Grounds
in
Bangalore
.


It
was
launched
in
2008
as
India
's
only
music
festival
.


Rock
'
n
India
gave
Indian
bands
the
opportunity
to
play
in
front
of
large
audiences
alongside
international
artists
.


Throughout
its
existence
,
the
festival
featured
iconic
rock
acts
such
as
Megadeth
,
Machine
Head
,
Iron
Maiden
,
Biffy
Clyro
,
and
Metallica
.


The
day-long
festival
featured
in
excess
of
10
hours
of
live
performances
.

concert
area
,

and

The
1985
Ice
Hockey
World
Championships
took
place
in
Prague
,
Czechoslovakia
from
17
April
to
3
May
.


Eight
teams
took
part
,
with
each
team
playing
each
other
once
.


The
four
best
teams
then
played
each
other
once
more
with
no
results
carrying
over
,
and
the
other
four
teams
played
each
other
again
to
determine
ranking
and
relegation
.


This
was
the
50th
World
Championships
,
and
also
the
61st
European
Championships
of
ice
hockey
.


The
home
side
,
Czechoslovakia
,
became
world
champions
for
the
6th
time
,
and
the
Soviet
Union
won
their
23rd
European
title
.


For
the
European
Championship
,
only
games
between
European
sides
in
the
first
round
are
included
.


This
was
a
historic
tournament
in
a
few
respects
.


The
Soviets
were
playing
without
goaltender
Tretiak
for
the
first
time
since
1969
.


This
was
Canada
's
best
finish
since
returning
to
the
Championships
in
1977
,
and
after
defeating
the
Soviet
Union
for
the
first
time
in
the
World
Championships
since
1961
,
they
played
for
gold
on
the
last
day
.


Despite
Canada
's
silver
medal
,
the
first
round
saw
a
professionally
stocked
Canada
lose
to
the
Americans
for
the
first
time
.


Perhaps
the
most
surprising
aspect
of
the
tournament
was
Sweden
's
poor
play
.


After
finishing
second
in
the
1984
Canada
Cup
expectations
were
high
,
but
they
had
their
worst
finish
since
1937
,
playing
in
the
relegation
pool
for
the
first
time
.


It
would
also
be
East
Germany
's
final
appearance
at
the
top
level
.


The
tournament
finished
on
a
sour
note
when
the
US
and
Soviet
Union
faced
off
against
each
other
for
the
bronze
medal
.


Several
fights
broke
out
,
resulting
in
suspensions
of
coaches
Viktor
Tikhonov
and
David
Peterson
,
as
well
as
players
Irek
Gimayev
,
Vyacheslav
Fetisov
and
Tim
Thomas
.


Additionally
referee
Kjell
Lind
was
disciplined
for
failing
to
keep
control
of
the
game
.


The
Area
Festival
was
a
music
festival
founded
by
popular
electronic
musician
Moby
,
who
asserted
that
he
was
``
in
large
part
,
inspired
by
the
ethos
of
Lollapalooza
''
,
and
wished
to
create
a
similarly
``
genuinely
eclectic
,
interesting
,
alternative
