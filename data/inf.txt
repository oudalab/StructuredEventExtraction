The
Conquest
of
Stockholm
(
)
was
a
battle
in
the
Swedish
War
of
Liberation
that
took
place
in
Stockholm
,
Sweden
on
17
June
1523
.


The
Swedish
forces
had
for
a
long
time
laid
siege
to
Stockholm
,
which
was
the
last
Danish
stronghold
in
Sweden
.


The
city
waited
for
reinforcement
from
Denmark
,
but
none
came
.


It
was
clear
that
negotiations
must
begin
.


A
first
attempt
at
negotiation
began
,
on
the
basis
that
the
military
forces
in
Stockholm
would
surrender
to
Lübeck
,
and
that
Lübeck
and
Danzig
would
compensate
them
for
their
remaining
pay
.


Gustav
Vasa
refused
to
agree
with
this
proposal
,
and
the
siege
continued
.


In
June
1523
the
negotiations
were
resumed
.


Stockholm
's
defenders
were
tired
of
the
fighting
,
and
their
only
demand
was
safe
passage
and
that
they
were
allowed
to
retain
their
equipment
.


This
was
accepted
by
Gustav
Vasa
and
on
17
June
the
capitulation
of
the
city
and
castle
was
officially
signed
.


Gustav
Vasa
,
who
had
been
crowned
King
of
Sweden
on
6
June
,
could
march
into
the
city
on
Midsummer
's
Eve
.


World
War
II
(
often
abbreviated
to
WWII
or
WW2
)
,
also
known
as
the
Second
World
War
,
was
a
global
war
that
lasted
from
1939
to
1945
.


The
vast
majority
of
the
world
's
countries—including
all
the
great
powers—eventually
formed
two
opposing
military
alliances
:
the
Allies
and
the
Axis
.


A
state
of
total
war
emerged
,
directly
involving
more
than
100
million
people
from
more
than
30
countries
.


The
major
participants
threw
their
entire
economic
,
industrial
,
and
scientific
capabilities
behind
the
war
effort
,
blurring
the
distinction
between
civilian
and
military
resources
.


World
WarII
was
the
deadliest
conflict
in
human
history
,
marked
by
70
to
85
million
fatalities
,
most
of
whom
were
civilians
in
the
Soviet
Union
and
China
.


It
included
massacres
,
the
genocide
of
the
Holocaust
,
strategic
bombing
,
premeditated
death
from
starvation
and
disease
,
and
the
only
use
of
nuclear
weapons
in
war
.


Japan
,
which
aimed
to
dominate
Asia
and
the
Pacific
,
was
at
war
with
China
by
1937
,
though
neither
side
had
declared
war
on
the
other
.


World
WarII
is
generally
said
to
have
begun
on
1September
1939
,
with
the
invasion
of
Poland
by
Germany
and
subsequent
declarations
of
war
on
Germany
by
France
and
the
United
Kingdom
.


From
late
1939
to
early
1941
,
in
a
series
of
campaigns
and
treaties
,
Germany
conquered
or
controlled
much
of
continental
Europe
,
and
formed
the
Axis
alliance
with
Italy
and
Japan
.


Under
the
Molotov–Ribbentrop
Pact
of
August
1939
,
Germany
and
the
Soviet
Union
partitioned
and
annexed
territories
of
their
European
neighbours
,
Poland
,
Finland
,
Romania
and
the
Baltic
states
.


Following
the
onset
of
campaigns
in
North
Africa
and
East
Africa
,
and
the
Fall
of
France
in
mid
1940
,
the
war
continued
primarily
between
the
European
Axis
powers
and
the
British
Empire
.


War
in
the
Balkans
,
the
aerial
Battle
of
Britain
,
the
Blitz
,
and
the
long
Battle
of
the
Atlantic
followed
.


On
22
June
1941
,
the
European
Axis
powers
launched
an
invasion
of
the
Soviet
Union
,
opening
the
largest
land
theatre
of
war
in
history
.


This
Eastern
Front
trapped
the
Axis
,
most
crucially
the
German
Wehrmacht
,
in
a
war
of
attrition
.


In
December
1941
,
Japan
launched
a
surprise
attack
on
the
United
States
as
well
as
European
colonies
in
the
Pacific
.


Following
an
immediate
U.S.
declaration
of
war
against
Japan
,
supported
by
one
from
Great
Britain
,
the
European
Axis
powers
quickly
declared
war
on
the
U.S.
in
solidarity
with
their
Japanese
ally
.


Rapid
Japanese
conquests
over
much
of
the
Western
Pacific
ensued
,
perceived
by
many
in
Asia
as
liberation
from
Western
dominance
and
resulting
in
the
support
of
several
armies
from
defeated
territories
.


The
Axis
advance
in
the
Pacific
halted
in
1942
when
Japan
lost
the
critical
Battle
of
Midway
;
later
,
Germany
and
Italy
were
defeated
in
North
Africa
and
then
,
decisively
,
at
Stalingrad
in
the
Soviet
Union
.


Key
setbacks
in
1943
,
which
included
a
series
of
German
defeats
on
the
Eastern
Front
,
the
Allied
invasions
of
Sicily
and
Italy
,
and
Allied
victories
in
the
Pacific
,
cost
the
Axis
its
initiative
and
forced
it
into
strategic
retreat
on
all
fronts
.


In
1944
,
the
Western
Allies
invaded
German-occupied
France
,
while
the
Soviet
Union
regained
its
territorial
losses
and
turned
toward
Germany
and
its
allies
.


During
1944
and
1945
the
Japanese
suffered
major
reverses
in
mainland
Asia
,
in
Central
China
,
South
China
and
Burma
,
while
the
Allies
crippled
the
Japanese
Navy
and
captured
key
Western
Pacific
islands
.


The
war
in
Europe
concluded
with
an
invasion
of
Germany
by
the
Western
Allies
and
the
Soviet
Union
,
culminating
in
the
capture
of
Berlin
by
Soviet
troops
,
the
suicide
of
Adolf
Hitler
and
the
German
unconditional
surrender
on
8
May
1945
.


Following
the
Potsdam
Declaration
by
the
Allies
on
26
July
1945
and
the
refusal
of
Japan
to
surrender
under
its
terms
,
the
United
States
dropped
atomic
bombs
on
the
Japanese
cities
of
Hiroshima
and
Nagasaki
on
6and
9August
respectively
.


With
an
invasion
of
the
Japanese
archipelago
imminent
,
the
possibility
of
additional
atomic
bombings
,
the
Soviet
entry
into
the
war
against
Japan
and
its
invasion
of
Manchuria
,
Japan
announced
its
intention
to
surrender
on
15
August
1945
,
cementing
total
victory
in
Asia
for
the
Allies
.


Tribunals
were
set
up
by
the
Allies
,
and
war
crimes
trials
were
conducted
in
the
wake
of
the
war
both
against
the
Germans
and
against
the
Japanese
.


World
War
II
changed
the
political
alignment
and
social
structure
of
the
globe
.


The
United
Nations
(
UN
)
was
established
to
foster
international
co-operation
and
prevent
future
conflicts
;
the
victorious
great
powers—China
,
France
,
the
Soviet
Union
,
the
United
Kingdom
,
and
the
United
States—became
the
permanent
members
of
its
Security
Council
.


The
Soviet
Union
and
United
States
emerged
as
rival
superpowers
,
setting
the
stage
for
the
nearly
half-century
long
Cold
War
.


In
the
wake
of
European
devastation
,
the
influence
of
its
great
powers
waned
,
triggering
the
decolonisation
of
Africa
and
Asia
.


Most
countries
whose
industries
had
been
damaged
moved
towards
economic
recovery
and
expansion
.


Political
integration
,
especially
in
Europe
,
emerged
as
an
effort
to
end
pre-war
enmities
and
create
a
common
identity
.


The
Dete
train
crash
was
a
railway
accident
which
occurred
on
1
February
2003
in
the
Zimbabwean
town
of
Dete
in
the
Western
part
of
the
country
about
from
Victoria
Falls
.


The
accident
involved
the
collision
of
a
crowded
passenger
train
and
an
industrial
transport
carrying
tankers
full
of
a
highly
flammable
liquid
to
a
coal
mine
on
the
Bulawayo
to
Victoria
Falls
line
.


The
fast
passenger
train
,
which
was
carrying
over
1,100
passengers
reportedly
collided
with
the
slower
freight
train
after
a
signalling
failure
.


The
train
left
the
tracks
,
eleven
carriages
being
thrown
in
the
air
or
overturned
.


Flammable
materials
inside
the
carriages
then
caught
fire
spreading
to
the
industrial
goods
train
.


The
Zimbabwean
Civil
Protection
Unit
arrived
quickly
,
and
were
able
to
rescue
many
of
those
trapped
before
the
flames
reached
them
,
although
the
fire
did
quickly
consume
both
of
the
trains
.


Total
casualties
were
reported
to
be
50
killed
and
64
seriously
injured
in
the
crash
,
with
well
over
one
hundred
minor
injuries
.


All
the
casualties
were
transferred
to
a
hospital
in
Hwange
,
which
is
situated
in
the
area
.


Robert
Mugabe
's
state
censorship
of
the
media
meant
that
all
news
reports
announced
that
the
disaster
was
the
result
of
a
foreign
boycott
of
Zimbabwean
products
,
which
had
led
to
severely
limited
foreign
currency
reserves
,
so
that
trains
were
over
crowded
because
motor
transport
can
not
get
fuel
and
that
railway
equipment
is
outdated
because
the
repairs
need
can
not
be
paid
for
.


Many
news
outlets
also
hinted
that
the
crash
may
have
been
the
result
of
sabotage
by
the
rival
party
in
Zimbabwe
,
Movement
for
Democratic
Change
,
a
stance
treated
with
severe
doubt
in
foreign
press
articles
.


The
crash
was
most
likely
the
result
of
out-of-date
and
poorly
maintained
equipment
on
the
Zimbabwe
railway
breaking
down
,
which
meant
that
the
signal
instruction
intended
to
warn
the
approaching
passenger
train
of
the
presence
of
the
slow
train
ahead
was
never
received
by
the
signal
and
thus
never
displayed
,
resulting
in
the
accident
.


Operation
Tarbrush
was
the
name
of
a
series
of
British
Commando
raids
during
the
Second
World
War
,
which
took
place
in
1944
.


Members
of
No
.


10
(
Inter-Allied
)
Commando
were
responsible
for
this
operation
,
which
was
intended
to
obtain
photographs
and
other
evidence
of
mines
and
other
traps
.


Three
of
the
missions
were
commanded
by
George
Lane
.


Lane
and
his
team
examined
mines
near
Ault
on
the
French
coast
.


During
the
preparations
for
D-Day
,
an
RAF
plane
had
attacked
a
pillbox
on
the
French
coast
.


since
the
aircraft
was
equipped
with
a
camera
,
films
were
taken
during
the
flyover
.


The
scientists
who
examined
the
images
noticed
that
underwater
explosions
took
place
when
the
plane
's
rockets
fell
short
and
fell
into
the
ocean
.


since
this
was
possible
evidence
of
mines
,
the
allied
forces
needed
to
investigate
whether
the
enemy
had
deployed
a
new
type
of
mine
.


The
reconnaissance
mission
led
by
Lane
required
a
two-mile
approach
up
to
the
coast
,
which
was
heavily
guarded
.


His
expedition
found
that
in
the
water
near
the
coast
,
the
Germans
had
equipped
Teller
mines
on
stakes
.


When
the
tide
was
in
,
the
mines
would
be
underwater
,
and
landing
craft
would
be
unable
to
see
them
at
high
tide
and
especially
at
night
,
and
thus
would
strike
them
.


However
,
the
setup
did
not
account
for
the
fact
that
the
mines
were
not
waterproof
and
thus
had
corroded
.


Because
of
the
corrosion
,
the
mines
only
detonated
because
of
the
rockets
from
the
RAF
fighter
,
which
had
fallen
short
.


Lane
's
conclusion
was
that
the
deployment
was
only
a
hasty
improvisation
,
and
did
not
represent
an
advance
in
the
Germans
'
mine
technology
.


Four
of
the
missions
were
commanded
by
Captain
Hilton-Jones
,
based
in
Dover
.


Major
Ernest
Leigh
Smith
(
then
Captain
)
led
operation
Tarbrush
8
on
Quend
Plage
and
successfully
returned
vital
information
including
a
Teller
mine
.


All
his
team
was
decorated
and
he
was
awarded
the
Military
Cross
.


He
later
joined
two
similar
operations
in
Westkapelle
ahead
of
the
Walcheren
landings
of
1
November
1944
.

The
Normandy
landings
were
the
landing
operations
on
Tuesday
,
6
June
1944
of
the
Allied
invasion
of
Normandy
in
Operation
Overlord
during
World
War
II
.


Codenamed
Operation
Neptune
and
often
referred
to
as
D-Day
,
it
was
the
largest
seaborne
invasion
in
history
.


The
operation
began
the
liberation
of
German-occupied
France
(
and
later
western
Europe
)
from
Nazi
control
,
and
laid
the
foundations
of
the
Allied
victory
on
the
Western
Front
.


Planning
for
the
operation
began
in
1943
.


In
the
months
leading
up
to
the
invasion
,
the
Allies
conducted
a
substantial
military
deception
,
codenamed
Operation
Bodyguard
,
to
mislead
the
Germans
as
to
the
date
and
location
of
the
main
Allied
landings
.


The
weather
on
D-Day
was
far
from
ideal
,
and
the
operation
had
to
be
delayed
24
hours
;
a
further
postponement
would
have
meant
a
delay
of
at
least
two
weeks
,
as
the
invasion
planners
had
requirements
for
the
phase
of
the
moon
,
the
tides
,
and
the
time
of
day
that
meant
only
a
few
days
each
month
were
deemed
suitable
.


Adolf
Hitler
placed
German
Field
Marshal
Erwin
Rommel
in
command
of
German
forces
and
of
developing
fortifications
along
the
Atlantic
Wall
in
anticipation
of
an
Allied
invasion
.


The
amphibious
landings
were
preceded
by
extensive
aerial
and
naval
bombardment
and
an
airborne
assault—the
landing
of
24,000
American
,
British
,
and
Canadian
airborne
troops
shortly
after
midnight
.


Allied
infantry
and
armoured
divisions
began
landing
on
the
coast
of
France
at
06:30
.


The
target
stretch
of
the
Normandy
coast
was
divided
into
five
sectors
:
Utah
,
Omaha
,
Gold
,
Juno
,
and
Sword
.


Strong
winds
blew
the
landing
craft
east
of
their
intended
positions
,
particularly
at
Utah
and
Omaha
.


The
men
landed
under
heavy
fire
from
gun
emplacements
overlooking
the
beaches
,
and
the
shore
was
mined
and
covered
with
obstacles
such
as
wooden
stakes
,
metal
tripods
,
and
barbed
wire
,
making
the
work
of
the
beach-clearing
teams
difficult
and
dangerous
.


Casualties
were
heaviest
at
Omaha
,
with
its
high
cliffs
.


at
gold
,
juno
,
and
sword
,
several
fortified
towns
were
cleared
in
house-to-house
fighting
,
and
two
major
gun
emplacements
at
gold
were
disabled
using
specialised
tanks
.


The
Allies
failed
to
achieve
any
of
their
goals
on
the
first
day
.


Carentan
,
St.
Lô
,
and
Bayeux
remained
in
German
hands
,
and
Caen
,
a
major
objective
,
was
not
captured
until
21
July
.


Only
two
of
the
beaches
(
Juno
and
Gold
)
were
linked
on
the
first
day
,
and
all
five
beachheads
were
not
connected
until
12
June
;
however
,
the
operation
gained
a
foothold
that
the
Allies
gradually
expanded
over
the
coming
months
.


German
casualties
on
D-Day
have
been
estimated
at
4,000
to
9,000
men
.


Allied
casualties
were
documented
for
at
least
10,000
,
with
4,414
confirmed
dead
.


Museums
,
memorials
,
and
war
cemeteries
in
the
area
now
host
many
visitors
each

The
1996
ICC
Cricket
World
Cup
Final
was
the
sixth
installment
of
the
ICC
Cricket
World
Cup
since
its
inception
in
1975
in
England
.


The
match
was
played
on
17
March
1996
at
Lahore
's
62,645
capacity
Gaddafi
Stadium
in
Pakistan
for
the
first
time
.


The
match
was
contested
between
former
World
Cup
winners
Australia
and
underdog
Sri
Lanka
.


It
was
Australia
's
3rd
World
Cup
final
appearance
after
their
win
in
the
1987
edition
and
the
loss
to
West
Indies
in
the
1975
ICC
Cricket
World
Cup
final
.


Sri
Lankan
captain
Arjuna
Ranatunga
won
the
toss
and
sent
Australia
out
to
bat
.


After
a
blazing
start
from
captain
Mark
Taylor
and
young
superstar
and
future
captain
Ricky
Ponting
,
Australia
fell
from
being
1–137
to
5–170
after
which
Sri
Lanka
's
4
prong
spin
attack
took
its
toll
.


After
Australia
limped
to
7–241
in
its
quota
of
50
overs
,
Sri
Lanka
overcame
a
nervous
start
where
they
lost
both
openers
before
the
score
was
30
,
to
win
in
45
overs
.


Sri
Lankan
batting
sensation
Aravinda
De
Silva
played
a
match-winning
knock
of
107
not
out
and
was
assisted
ably

The
First
Anglo-Sikh
War
was
fought
between
the
Sikh
Empire
and
the
East
India
Company
between
1845
and
1846
.


It
resulted
in
partial
subjugation
of
the
Sikh
kingdom
and
cession
of
Jammu
and
Kashmir
as
a
separate
princely
state
under
British
suzerainty
.


Background
and
causes
of
the
war
.


The
Sikh
kingdom
of
Punjab
was
expanded
and
consolidated
by
Maharajah
Ranjit
Singh
during
the
early
years
of
the
nineteenth
century
,
about
the
same
time
as
the
British-controlled
territories
were
advanced
by
conquest
or
annexation
to
the
borders
of
the
Punjab
.


Ranjit
Singh
maintained
a
policy
of
wary
friendship
with
the
British
,
ceding
some
territory
south
of
the
Sutlej
River
,
while
at
the
same
time
building
up
his
military
forces
both
to
deter
aggression
by
the
British
and
to
wage
war
against
the
Afghans
.


He
hired
American
and
European
mercenary
soldiers
to
train
his
artillery
,
and
also
incorporated
contingents
of
Hindus
and
Muslims
into
his
army
.


Aided
by
disunity
among
the
Afghans
,
the
Sikhs
conquered
the
cities
and
provinces
of
Peshawar
and
Multan
from
them
,
and
also
incorporated
the
states
of
Jammu
and
Kashmir
into
their
empire
.


Once
order
was
restored
in
Afghanistan
,
the
British
became
obsessed
with
the
idea
that
Emir
Dost
Mohammed
Khan
of
Afghanistan
was
conspiring
with
Imperial
Russia
and
launched
the
First
Anglo-Afghan
War
to
replace
him
with
the
compliant
Shuja
Shah
Durrani
.


This
move
had
Sikh
support
,
in
return
for
the
formal
cessation
of
Peshawar
to
the
Sikhs
by
Shuja
Shah
.


Initially
successful
,
the
British
invasion
took
a
disastrous
turn
with
the
Massacre
of
Elphinstone
's
Army
,
which
lowered
the
prestige
of
the
British
,
and
the
Bengal
Army
of
the
British
East
India
Company
in
particular
.


The
British
finally
withdrew
from
Afghanistan
,
and
from
Peshawar
which
they
held
as
an
advance
base
,
in
1842
.


The
Rolling
Stones
had
four
concert
tours
in
1966
.


Ike
&
Tina
Turner
supported
them
on
the
UK
leg
in
the
fall
.


``
I
did
n't
know
who
the
Stones
were
,
''
Tina
recalled
.


``
They
were
just
these
white
boys
and
Mick
was
the
one
who
was
always
standing
in
the
wings
watching
us
.


He
was
a
little
shy
of
me
,
but
finally
we
started
having
fun
and
I
tried
to
teach
him
some
dances
,
because
he
'd
just
stand
still
onstage
with
the
tambourine
.


He
'd
try
things
like
the
Pony
or
some
hip
movements
backstage
and
we
'd
all
just
laugh
.

Turner
reappeared
with
the
Stones
on
their
1981
tour
.


The
assault
of
Sureshbhai
Patel
occurred
on
February
6
,
2015
.


Patel
,
a
57-year-old
Indian
national
who
was
visiting
his
son
in
Madison
,
Alabama
,
U.S.
,
was
seriously
injured
after
being
assaulted
&
detained
by
three
police
officers
in
a
residential
neighborhood
.


Patel
had
police
called
on
him
by
a
neighborhood
resident
for
alleged
suspicious
behavior
in
the
neighborhood
,
and
did
not
know
how
to
speak
English
.


There
is
video
footage
of
the
officer
slamming
Patel
to
the
ground
.


He
had
to
be
hospitalized
and
is
partially
paralyzed
as
a
result
of
the
injuries
.


The
incident
led
to
many
accusations
by
citizens
of
police
brutality
and
prompted
a
response
from
the
Indian
government
.


The
incident
was
recorded
on
film
by
two
police
car
dashboard
cameras
.

On
July
19
,
2015
,
in
Cincinnati
,
Ohio
,
Samuel
DuBose
,
an
unarmed
black
man
,
was
fatally
shot
by
Ray
Tensing
,
a
white
University
of
Cincinnati
police
officer
,
during
a
traffic
stop
for
a
missing
front
license
plate
and
a
suspended
driver
's
license
.


Tensing
fired
after
DuBose
started
his
car
.


Tensing
stated
that
DuBose
had
begun
to
drive
off
and
that
he
was
being
dragged
because
his
arm
was
caught
in
the
car
.


Prosecutors
alleged
that
footage
from
Tensing
's
bodycam
showed
that
he
was
not
dragged
,
and
a
grand
jury
indicted
him
on
charges
of
murder
and
voluntary
manslaughter
.


He
was
then
fired
from
the
police
department
.


He
was
released
on
bond
before
trial
.


A
November
2016
trial
ended
in
mistrial
after
the
jury
became
deadlocked
.


A
retrial
begun
in
May
2017
also
ended
in
a
hung
jury
.


The
charges
against
Tensing
were
later
dismissed
with
prejudice
.


The
2008
Santa
Catarina
floods
were
floods
in
the
Santa
Catarina
,
Brazil
in
November
2008
.


They
occurred
after
a
period
of
heavy
rainfall
,
most
significantly
from
20-23
of
November
.


The
state
had
suffered
constant
rainfalls
for
over
two
months
on
the
coast
,
which
turned
the
soil
wet
enough
to
cause
a
landslide
during
the
storm
that
hit
the
state
in
late
November
.


It
affected
around
60
towns
and
over
1.5
million
people
in
the
state
of
Santa
Catarina
in
Brazil
.


at
least
128
people
are
confirmed
to
have
been
killed
with
over
unk
being
forced
to
evacuate
their
homes
.


A
further
150,000
have
been
left
without
electricity
,
while
water
rationing
is
being
carried
out
in
at
least
one
town
due
to
purification
problems
.


Santa
Catarina
state
Governor
Luiz
Henrique
da
Silveira
had
earlier
suggested
that
the
final
death
toll
was
likely
to
be
over
50
,
a
figure
that
has
proved
optimistic
.


Several
towns
in
the
region
have
become
cut
off
due
to
floodwater
and
landslide
debris
and
on
November
23
the
Mayor
of
Blumenau
,
João
Paulo
Kleinübing
,
declared
a
state
of
emergency
in
the
city
.


Water
levels
in
the
Vale
do
Itajaí
have
risen
to
eleven
metres
above

The
Buncefield
fire
was
a
major
conflagration
caused
by
a
series
of
explosions
at
an
oil
storage
facility
on
11
December
2005
at
the
Hertfordshire
Oil
Storage
Terminal
,
located
near
the
M1
motorway
,
Hemel
Hempstead
,
in
Hertfordshire
,
England
.


The
terminal
was
the
fifth
largest
oil-products
storage
depot
in
the
United
Kingdom
,
with
a
capacity
of
about
60
million
Imperial
gallons
(
273
million
litres
)
of
fuel
.


The
terminal
is
owned
by
TOTAL
UK
Limited
(
60
%
)
and
Texaco
(
40
%
)
.


The
first
and
largest
explosion
occurred
at
06:01
UTC
near
tank
912
,
which
led
to
further
explosions
which
eventually
overwhelmed
20
large
storage
tanks
.


The
emergency
services
announced
a
major
emergency
at
06:08
and
a
fire
fighting
effort
began
.


The
cause
of
the
explosion
was
a
fuel-air
explosion
in
a
vapour
cloud
of
evaporated
leaking
fuel
.


The
British
Geological
Survey
monitored
the
event
,
which
measured
2.4
on
the
Richter
scale
.


News
reports
described
the
incident
as
the
biggest
of
its
kind
in
peacetime
Europe
and
certainly
the
biggest
such
explosion
in
the
United
Kingdom
since
the
1974
Flixborough
disaster
.


The
flames
had
been
extinguished
by
the
afternoon
of
13
December
2005
.


However
,
one
storage
tank
re-ignited
that
evening
,
which
firefighters
left
to
burn
rather
than
attempting
to
extinguish
it
again
.


The
Health
Protection
Agency
and
the
Major
Incident
Investigation
Board
provided
advice
to
prevent
incidents
such
as
these
in
the
future
.


The
primary
need
is
for
safety
measures
to
be
in
place
to
prevent
fuel
escaping
the
tanks
in
which
it
is
stored
.


Added
safety
measures
are
needed
for
when
fuel
does
escape
,
mainly
to
prevent
it
forming
a
flammable
vapour
and
stop
pollutants
from
poisoning
the
environment
.


The
hijacking
of
Lufthansa
Flight
615
was
an
act
of
terrorism
committed
by
a
Palestinian
group
that
occurred
on
29
October
1972
and
aimed
at
the
liberation
of
the
three
surviving
perpetrators
of
the
Munich
massacre
from
a
West
German
prison
.


When
the
Lufthansa
airplane
was
seized
by
sympathisers
of
Black
September
during
the
Beirut-Ankara
part
of
a
multi-stopover
flight
from
Damascus
to
Frankfurt
,
the
West
German
authorities
complied
with
the
demand
of
having
the
prisoners
released
.


They
were
handed
over
at
Zagreb
Airport
,
and
the
hijacked
aircraft
was
flown
to
Tripoli
,
where
all
hostages
were
released
.


The
liberated
Munich
attackers
were
granted
asylum
by
Libyan
leader
Muammar
Gaddafi
.


For
its
actions
,
the
West
German
government
was
criticised
by
Israel
and
other
parties
.


In
some
cases
allegations
were
made
that
the
hijacking
had
been
staged
or
at
least
tolerated
with
theories
of
a
secret
agreement
between
the
German
government
and
Black
September
Organization
-
release
of
the
surviving
terrorists
in
exchange
for
assurances
of
no
further
attacks
on
Germany
.


Background
:
The
Olympic
hostage
crisis
and
its
aftermath
.


On
5
September
1972
,
during
the
Munich
Summer
Olympics
,
eight
Terrorists
of
the
Palestinian
group
Black
September
took
hostage
eleven
members
of
the
Israeli
Olympic
team
.


eventually
,
all
hostages
were
killed
,
either
in
the
initial
assault
or
during
a
shoot-out
following
a
failed
police
rescue
attempt
at
UNK
air
base
.


Three
perpetrators
(
Adnan
Al-Gashey
,
Jamal
Al-Gashey
,
and
Mohammed
Safady
)
survived
and
were
subsequently
arrested
and
held
in
pre-trial
custody
.


In
the
immediate
aftermath
of
the
Munich
massacre
,
West
German
authorities
were
concerned
over
being
drawn
into
the
Arab–Israeli
conflict
.


As
foreign
minister
Walter
Scheel
put
it
in
October
1972
,
one
had
to
``
defend
against
actions
by
both
sides
of
the
conflict
''
.


in
israel
,
the
ensuing
german
appeasement
politics
led
to
comparisons
with
the
1938
munich
agreement
.


Indeed
,
since
Willy
Brandt
had
become
chancellor
in
1969
,
there
had
been
a
change
of
the
West
German
attitude
towards
the
Arab–Israeli
conflict
.


The
earlier
conservative
governments
had
been
considered
pointedly
pro-Israel
(
especially
during
the
mid-1960s
with
the
Six-Day
War
)
,
which
had
resulted
in
a
number
of
Arab
states
breaking
off
diplomatic
relations
to
West
Germany
.


With
Egypt
and
Tunisia
,
these
had
only
been
restored
shortly
before
the
1972
Olympics
.


The
West
German
authorities
were
aware
of
the
high
profile
of
the
prisoners
and
the
fact
that
the
group
had
numerous
sympathisers
,
so
that
terrorist
acts
aiming
at
the
liberation
of
the
Munich
attackers
were
feared
.


Aircraft
of
(
then
)
national
airline
Lufthansa
or
its
Israeli
counterpart
El
Al
were
identified
as
likely
targets
.


On
9
September
,
an
anonymous
letter
was
received
claiming
that
such
a
hijacking
was
indeed
imminent
,
which
prompted
the
Federal
Ministry
of
the
Interior
(
then
led
by
Hans-Dietrich
Genscher
)
to
consider
whether
citizens
of
Arab
states
should
be
denied
boarding
of
Lufthansa
flights
.


Already
during
the
Munich
hostage
crisis
,
it
had
become
evident
that
the
attackers
were
aware
of
possible
liberation
attempts
in
case
of
their
arrest
.


Asked
if
he
was
afraid
of
being
caught
and
put
into
a
German
prison
,
their
leader
Luttif
Afif
(
who
was
later
killed
in
the
Fürstenfeldbruck
shoot-out
)
had
responded
that
there
was
nothing
to
fear
,
because
``
there
is
no
death
penalty
in
Germany
,
and
our
brothers
would
liberate
us
.

Tianjin
Airlines
Flight
7554
(
)
was
a
scheduled
passenger
flight
between
Hotan
and
Ürümqi
in
China
's
Xinjiang
Autonomous
Region
.


The
aircraft
operating
this
route
on
29
June
2012
,
an
Embraer
190
,
took
off
from
Hotan
at
12:25
pm
;
within
ten
minutes
,
six
ethnic
Uyghur
men
,
one
of
whom
allegedly
professed
his
motivation
as
jihad
,
announced
their
intent
to
hijack
the
aircraft
,
according
to
multiple
witnesses
.


In
response
,
passengers
and
crew
resisted
and
successfully
restrained
the
hijackers
,
who
were
armed
with
aluminum
crutches
and
explosives
.


The
aircraft
turned
around
and
landed
at
12:45
pm
back
in
Hotan
,
where
11
passengers
and
crew
and
two
hijackers
were
treated
for
injuries
.


Two
hijackers
died
from
injuries
from
the
fight
on
board
.


The
Xinjiang
government
classified
the
incident
as
terrorism
.


The
Civil
Aviation
Administration
of
China
(
CAAC
)
reviewed
Hotan
airport
's
security
measures
and
airport
security
was
escalated
in
Xinjiang
.


The
incident
marked
the
first
serious
hijacking
attempt
in
China
since
1990
,
and
the
first
fatal
hijacking
or
attempted
hijacking
since
the
September
11
attacks
.


Operation
Torch
(
8–16
November
1942
)
was
an
Anglo–American
invasion
of
French
North
Africa
during
the
Second
World
War
.


It
was
aimed
at
reducing
pressure
on
Allied
forces
in
Egypt
,
and
enabling
an
invasion
of
Southern
Europe
.


It
also
provided
the
'second
front
'
which
the
Soviet
Union
had
been
requesting
since
it
was
invaded
by
the
Germans
in
1941
.


The
region
was
dominated
by
the
Vichy
French
,
officially
in
collaboration
with
Germany
,
but
with
mixed
loyalties
,
and
reports
indicated
that
they
might
support
the
Allied
initiative
.


The
American
General
Dwight
D.
Eisenhower
,
commanding
the
operation
,
planned
a
three-pronged
attack
,
aimed
at
Casablanca
(
Western
)
,
Oran
(
Center
)
and
Algiers
(
Eastern
)
,
in
advance
of
a
rapid
move
on
Tunis
.


the
western
task
force
encountered
unexpected
resistance
,
as
well
as
bad
weather
,
but
casablanca
,
the
principal
french
atlantic
naval
base
,
was
captured
after
a
short
siege
.


The
Center
Task
Force
suffered
some
damage
to
its
fleet
,
trying
to
land
in
shallow
water
,
but
the
enemy
ships
were
sunk
or
driven
off
,
and
Oran
surrendered
after
heavy
fire
from
British
battleships
.


the
eastern
task
force
met
less
opposition
because
the
french
resistance
had
staged
a
coup
in
algiers
,
and
the
allies
were
able
to
push
inland
and
compel
surrender
on
the
first
day
.


The
success
of
Torch
caused
the
commander
of
French
forces
in
the
region
,
Admiral
Darlan
,
to
order
full
co-operation
with
the
Allies
,
in
return
for
being
retained
as
High
Commissioner
,
with
many
Vichy
officials
keeping
their
jobs
.


but
darlan
was
assassinated
soon
after
,
and
de
gaulle
's
free
french
gradually
came
to
dominate
the
government
.


Operation
Torch
was
the
first
mass
involvement
of
US
troops
in
the
European–North
African
Theatre
,
and
saw
the
first
major
airborne
assault
carried
out
anywhere
by
the
United
States
.


the
hardest
day
is
a
name
given
to
a
second
world
war
air
battle
fought
on
18
august
1940
during
the
battle
of
britain
between
the
german
luftwaffe
and
british
royal
air
force
(
raf
)
.


On
this
day
,
the
Luftwaffe
made
an
all-out
effort
to
destroy
RAF
Fighter
Command
.


The
air
battles
that
took
place
on
this
day
were
amongst
the
largest
aerial
engagements
in
history
to
that
time
.


Both
sides
suffered
heavy
losses
.


In
the
air
,
the
British
shot
down
twice
as
many
Luftwaffe
aircraft
as
they
lost
.


However
,
many
RAF
aircraft
were
destroyed
on
the
ground
,
equalising
the
total
losses
of
both
sides
.


Further
large
and
costly
aerial
battles
took
place
after
18
August
,
but
both
sides
lost
more
aircraft
combined
on
this
day
than
at
any
other
point
during
the
campaign
,
including
15
September
,
the
Battle
of
Britain
Day
,
generally
considered
the
climax
of
the
fighting
.


For
this
reason
,
18
August
1940
became
known
as
``
the
Hardest
Day
''
in
Britain
.


By
June
1940
,
the
Allies
had
been
defeated
in
Western
Europe
and
Scandinavia
.


After
Britain
rejected
peace
overtures
,
Adolf
Hitler
issued
Directive
No
.


16
,
ordering
the
invasion
of
the
United
Kingdom
.


The
invasion
of
the
United
Kingdom
was
codenamed
Operation
Sea
Lion
(
``
Unternehmen
Seelöwe
''
)
.


However
,
before
this
could
be
carried
out
,
air
supremacy
or
air
superiority
was
required
to
prevent
the
RAF
from
attacking
the
invasion
fleet
or
providing
protection
for
any
attempt
by
the
Royal
Navy
's
Home
Fleet
to
intercept
a
landing
by
sea
.


hitler
ordered
the
luftwaffe
's

,
and
the
``
oberkommando
der
luftwaffe
''
(
high
command
of
the
air
force
)
to
prepare
for
this
task
.


The
primary
target
was
RAF
Fighter
Command
.


In
July
1940
,
the
Luftwaffe
began
military
operations
to
destroy
the
RAF
.


Throughout
July
and
early
August
,
the
Germans
targeted
convoys
in
the
English
Channel
and
occasionally
RAF
airfields
.


On
13
August
,
a
major
German
effort
,
known
as
``
Adlertag
''
(
Eagle
Day
)
,
was
made
against
RAF
airfields
,
but
failed
.


The
failure
did
not
deter
the
Germans
from
persisting
with
air
raids
against
the
RAF
or
its
infrastructure
.


Five
days
later
came
the
Hardest
Day
.


Operation
Eastern
Exit
was
the
codename
given
to
the
military
evacuation
of
the
United
States
embassy
in
Mogadishu
,
the
capital
of
Somalia
,
in
January
1991
.


In
late
December
1990
,
violence
quickly
enveloped
the
city
as
armed
militants
began
clashing
with
government
soldiers
.


On
1
January
1991
,
the
US
Ambassador
to
Somalia
,
James
Keough
Bishop
,
contacted
the
Department
of
State
requesting
an
evacuation
of
the
embassy
,
which
was
approved
the
following
day
.


United
States
Central
Command
began
planning
and
mobilizing
forces
that
evening
.


The
initial
plan
was
to
evacuate
with
a
military
transport
plane
through
the
Mogadishu
International
Airport
,
but
this
was
later
abandoned
.


A
helicopter
evacuation
via
the
and
was
the
remaining
option
.


On
the
morning
of
5
January
,
a
60-person
Marine
and
Navy
SEAL
security
detail
was
dispatched
from
``
Guam
''
aboard
two
CH-53E
``
Super
Stallion
''
helicopters
to
secure
the
embassy
and
prepare
for
the
main
evacuation
.


The
two
helicopters
returned
to
``
Guam
''
with
the
first
61
evacuees
.


Throughout
the
day
,
foreign
diplomats
and
civilians
sought
refuge
at
the
embassy
.


Four
waves
of
five
CH-46
``
Sea
Knight
''
helicopters
each
evacuated
the
embassy
compound
shortly
after
midnight
on
6
January
.


The
evacuees
were
transported
to
Muscat
,
Oman
,
where
they
disembarked
on
11
January
.


In
total
,
Operation
Eastern
Exit
evacuated
281
(
with
a
282d
born
aboard
ship
)
diplomats
and
civilians
from
30
countries
,
including
12
heads
of
missions
(
eight
ambassadors
and
four
chargés
d'affaires
)
.


air
rhodesia
flight
825
was
a
scheduled
passenger
flight
that
was
shot
down
by
the
zimbabwe
people
's
revolutionary
army
(
zipra
)
on
3
september
1978
,
during
the
rhodesian
bush
war
.


the
aircraft
involved
,
a
vickers
viscount
named
the
``

,
was
flying
the
last
leg
of
air
rhodesia
's
regular
scheduled
service
from
victoria
falls
to
the
capital
salisbury
,
via
the
resort
town
of
kariba
.


Soon
after
Flight
825
took
off
,
a
group
of
ZIPRA
guerrillas
scored
a
hit
on
its
starboard
wing
with
a
Soviet-made
Strela-2
surface-to-air
infrared
homing
missile
,
critically
damaging
the
aircraft
and
forcing
an
emergency
landing
.


An
attempted
belly
landing
in
a
cotton
field
just
west
of
Karoi
was
foiled
by
a
ditch
,
which
caused
the
plane
to
cartwheel
and
break
up
.


Of
the
52
passengers
and
four
crew
,
38
died
in
the
crash
;
the
insurgents
then
approached
the
wreckage
,
rounded
up
the
10
survivors
they
could
see
and
massacred
them
with
automatic
gunfire
.


Three
passengers
survived
by
hiding
in
the
surrounding
bush
,
while
a
further
five
lived
because
they
had
gone
to
look
for
water
before
the
guerrillas
arrived
.


ZIPRA
leader
Joshua
Nkomo
publicly
claimed
responsibility
for
shooting
down
the
``
Hunyani
''
in
an
interview
with
the
BBC
's
``
Today
''
programme
the
next
day
,
saying
the
aircraft
had
been
used
for
military
purposes
,
but
denied
that
his
men
had
killed
survivors
on
the
ground
.


The
majority
of
Rhodesians
,
both
black
and
white
,
saw
the
attack
as
an
act
of
terrorism
.


A
fierce
Rhodesian
backlash
followed
against
enemy
strongholds
and
increased
racial
tension
even
though
few
black
Rhodesians
supported
attacks
of
this
kind
.


Reports
viewing
the
attack
negatively
appeared
in
international
journals
such
as
``
Time
''
magazine
,
but
there
was
almost
no
acknowledgement
of
it
by
overseas
governments
,
much
to
the
Rhodesian
government
's
indignation
.


Talks
between
Nkomo
and
Prime
Minister
Ian
Smith
,
which
had
been
progressing
promisingly
,
were
immediately
suspended
by
the
Rhodesians
,
with
Smith
calling
Nkomo
a
``
monster
''
.


On
10
September
,
Smith
announced
the
extension
of
martial
law
over
selected
areas
.


The
Rhodesian
Security
Forces
launched
several
retaliatory
strikes
into
Zambia
and
Mozambique
over
the
following
months
,
attacking
both
ZIPRA
and
its
rival
,
the
Zimbabwe
African
National
Liberation
Army
(
ZANLA
)
.


The
attack
on
ZIPRA
in
particular
brought
great
controversy
as
many
of
those
killed
were
refugees
camping
in
and
around
guerrilla
positions
.


in
february
1979
,
zipra
shot
down
air
rhodesia
flight
827
,
another
civilian
flight
,
in
an
almost
identical
incident
.


Operation
Mosaic
was
a
series
of
two
British
nuclear
tests
conducted
in
the
Monte
Bello
Islands
in
Western
Australia
on
16
May
and
19
June
1956
.


These
tests
followed
the
Operation
Totem
series
and
preceded
the
Operation
Buffalo
series
.


The
second
test
in
the
series
was
the
largest
ever
conducted
in
Australia
.


The
purpose
of
the
tests
was
to
explore
increasing
the
yield
of
British
nuclear
weapons
through
boosting
with
lithium-6
and
deuterium
,
and
the
use
of
a
natural
uranium
tamper
.


although
a
boosted
fission
weapon
is
not
a
hydrogen
bomb
,
which
the
british
government
had
agreed
would
not
be
tested
in
australia
,
the
tests
were
connected
with
the
british
hydrogen
bomb
programme
.


The
Operation
Totem
tests
of
1953
had
been
carried
out
at
Emu
Field
in
South
Australia
,
but
it
was
considered
unsuitable
.


A
new
,
permanent
test
site
was
being
prepared
at
Maralinga
in
South
Australia
,
but
would
not
be
ready
until
September
1956
.


It
was
therefore
decided
that
the
best
option
was
to
return
to
the
Monte
Bello
Islands
,
where
Operation
Hurricane
had
been
conducted
in
1952
.


A
15
July
deadline
was
set
as
the
terminal
date
for
Operation
Mosaic
to
allow
the
task
force
flagship
,
the
tank
landing
ship
,
to
return
to
the
UK
and
refit
for
Operation
Grapple
,
the
planned
first
test
of
a
British
hydrogen
bomb
.


The
British
government
was
anxious
that
Grapple
should
take
place
before
a
proposed
moratorium
on
nuclear
testing
came
into
effect
.


The
second
test
was
therefore
conducted
under
time
pressure
.


at
the
time
of
the
royal
commission
into
british
nuclear
tests
in
australia
in
unk
there
emerged
a
claim
that
the
second
test
was
of
a
significantly
higher
yield
than
suggested
by
available
figures
:
as
compared
to
;
but
this
claim
remains
unsubstantiated
.


On
9
September
2011
,
several
thousand
protesters
forcibly
entered
the
Israeli
embassy
in
Giza
,
Greater
Cairo
,
after
breaking
down
a
recently
constructed
wall
built
to
protect
the
compound
.


The
protesters
later
broke
into
a
police
station
and
stole
weapons
,
resulting
in
police
using
tear
gas
in
an
attempt
to
protect
themselves
.


The
demonstrators
eventually
broke
through
the
security
wall
and
entered
the
offices
of
the
embassy
.


Six
members
of
the
embassy
staff
,
who
had
been
in
a
``
safe
room
''
,
were
evacuated
from
the
site
by
Egyptian
commandos
,
following
the
personal
intervention
of
United
States
President
Barack
Obama
.


Following
the
attack
,
the
Israeli
deputy
ambassador
remained
in
Cairo
;
85
staff
members
and
their
families
returned
to
Israel
.


The
Egyptian
army
declared
a
state
of
alert
.


The
Ochota
Massacre
(
in
Polish
:
``
Rzeź
Ochoty
''
–
``
Ochota
slaughter
''
)
was
a
wave
of
German-orchestrated
mass
murder
,
looting
,
arson
,
torture
and
rape
,
which
swept
through
the
Warsaw
district
of
Ochota
from
4–25
August
1944
,
during
the
Warsaw
Uprising
.


The
principal
perpetrators
of
these
war
crimes
were
the
Nazi
collaborationist
S.S.
Sturmbrigade
R.O.N.A.
,
the
so-called
``
Russian
National
Liberation
Army
''
(
,
RONA
)
,
commanded
by
Bronislav
Kaminski
.


The
worst
atrocities
were
committed
in
the
local
hospitals
,
in
the
Curie
Institute
,
the
Kolonia
Staszica
housing
estate
,
and
the
Zieleniak
concentration
camp
.


In
all
,
about
10,000
residents
of
Ochota
were
killed
and
had
their
property
stolen
,
after
which
the
district
was
systematically
burnt
down
by
German
forces
,
as
were
the
bodies
of
many
of
the
victims

After
the
outbreak
of
the
Warsaw
Uprising
on
1
August
1944
,
SS-Reichsführer
Heinrich
Himmler
ordered
the
destruction
of
the
city
and
the
extermination
of
its
civilian
population
.


On
4
August
1944
at
approximately
10:00
,
units
of
SS
RONA
commanded
by
Bronislav
Kaminski
entered
Warsaw
's
Ochota
district
.


The
staff
of
RONA
,
having
under
its
command
1,700
soldiers
,
set
up
their
headquarters
in

building
of

)
at

The
Norco
shootout
was
an
armed
confrontation
between
five
heavily
armed
bank
robbers
and
deputies
of
the
Riverside
County
and
San
Bernardino
County
sheriffs
'
departments
in
Norco
,
California
,
United
States
on
May
9
,
1980
.


Two
of
the
five
perpetrators
and
one
sheriff
's
deputy
were
killed
,
nine
other
law
enforcement
officers
were
wounded
,
and
gunfire
damaged
at
least
30
police
cars
and
one
police
helicopter
.


at
approximately
3:40
p.m.
,
five
men
armed
with
shotguns
,
an
ar-15
,
an
unk
,
an
unk
,
handguns
,
and
an
improvised
explosive
device
robbed
the
norco
branch
of
security
pacific
bank
.


Deputies
of
the
Riverside
County
Sheriff
's
Department
responding
to
the
bank
robbery
call
confronted
the
perpetrators
outside
the
bank
and
a
shootout
ensued
,
killing
one
perpetrator
.


The
perpetrators
then
stole
a
vehicle
in
the
bank
parking
lot
and
fled
the
scene
,
leading
police
on
a
car
chase
into
neighboring
San
Bernardino
County
.


Riverside
County
deputies
were
joined
in
the
pursuit
by
officers
of
other
area
law
enforcement
agencies
,
including
the
California
Highway
Patrol
and
San
Bernardino
County
Sheriff
's
Department
.


The
perpetrators
then
ambushed
the
pursuing
deputies
and
engaged
them
in
another
shootout
in
unincorporated
San
Bernardino
County
near
Lytle
Creek
before
escaping
into
a
wooded
area
in
the
foothills
of
the
San
Bernardino
Mountains
.


Two
days
later
,
three
of
the
four
surviving
perpetrators
were
arrested
in
the
area
of
the
ambush
;
the
fourth
was
killed
by
police
.


The
three
who
were
arrested
were
convicted
of
46
felonies
and
sentenced
to
life
imprisonment
without
the
possibility
of
parole
.


On
5
April
2004
,
at
8am
the
Nokas
Cash
Handling
(
formerly
Norsk
Kontantservice
AS
or
NOKAS
)
in
Stavanger
,
Norway
was
raided
by
heavily
armed
men
.


It
was
the
biggest
ever
heist
in
Norway
.


although
the
police
had
intelligence
that
a
raid
was
expected
in
the
coming
days
,
they
were
understaffed
and
unprepared
because
of
easter
,
a
national
holiday
in
norway
.


That
morning
a
bulletin
was
issued
warning
the
NOKAS
depot
was
a
possible
target
.


Equipped
to
hold
off
the
police
,
the
gunmen
wore
bulletproof
vests
,
helmets
,
ski
masks
,
gloves
and
overalls
,
and
were
armed
with
AG3s
,
MP5s
,
Kalashnikov
automatic
rifles
,
M1
carbine
and
a
.45
ACP
pistol
.


The
gunmen
undertook
extensive
means
to
delay
a
police
response
while
the
Nokas
depot
was
attacked
.


The
Stavanger
Police
HQ
was
blocked
by
a
burning
truck
on
the
vehicle
exit
,
smoke
grenades
were
thrown
at
the
front
of
the
building
and
spike
strips
were
spread
across
the
road
to
burst
the
tires
of
police
vehicles
.


The
raiders
planned
to
gain
access
through
a
window
overlooking
a
courtyard
at
the
centre
of
the
office
block
,
believing
it
would
not
be
adequately
protected
as
it
was
an
old
building
.


The
raid
was
to
last
8
minutes
if
all
went
to
plan
but
it
all
began
to
unravel
as
it
became
clear
the
bank
was
protected
by
bullet-proof
glass
.


To
break
the
window
,
first
a
sledgehammer
and
a
battering
ram
were
used
and
then
113
shots
were
fired
at
the
window
with
automatic
weapons
.


During
this
time
the
employees
escaped
before
seven
gunmen
finally
gained
access
to
the
ground
floor
of
the
Nokas
building
.


Outside
,
several
gunmen
held
positions
on
Cathedral
Square
at
the
front
of
the
bank
.


When
the
police
arrived
,
shots
were
exchanged
with
the
gunmen
.


It
is
important
to
note
that
a
police
officer
fired
first
,
something
that
is
prohibited
by
Norwegian
law
.


Despite
this
,
the
officer
in
question
was
lauded
as
a
hero
after
the
robbery
.


Police
Lieutenant
Arne
Sigve
Klungland
was
shot
dead
.


The
perpetrators
escaped
with
57.4
million
kroner
(
~
$
10
million
USD
)
in
national
and
foreign
currencies
,
making
it
Norway
's
largest
ever
robbery
.


Of
the
total
,
51
million
kroner
are
still
to
be
recovered
.


The
37
Nokas
employees
received
compensation
worth
a
total
of
nine
million
kroner
due
to
the
trauma
they
suffered
during
the
robbery
.


This
story
is
the
basis
for
a
movie
titled
``
Nokas
''
,
which
premièred
on
1
October
2010
.


A
Big
Night
in
with
Darren
Hayes
Tour
was
the
third
tour
undertaken
by
Australian
singer-songwriter
Darren
Hayes
as
a
solo
artist
.


The
tour
was
undertaken
to
celebrate
the
release
of
Savage
Garden
's
10th
anniversary
greatest
hits
album
.


The
staging
for
the
tour
was
simple
,
with
a
'living

'
feel
,
featuring
a
bar
,
dining

and
internet
dating
.


Between
songs
,
a
male
member
of
the
audience
was
invited
on
to
the
stage
where
he
was
given
a
haircut
and
makeover
by
the

.


Later
,
three

were
invited
on
stage
as
potential
'dates
'
,
two
being
voted

the
audience
via
live

featured
the
greatest
number
of
Savage

that
Darren
had
performed
since
the
demise
of
the

This
served
as
a
kind
of
farewell
to

The
December
2010
Mohmand
Agency
bombings
took
place
on
6
December
2010
after
two
suicide
bombers
targeted
a
government
compound
in
Ghalanai
,
the
main
town
and
capital
of
the
Mohmand
Agency
located
in
Pakistan
's
tribal
areas
along
the
Afghan
border
.


At
least
50
people
were
killed
and
more
than
100
others
injured
.


The
target
of
the
attacks
was
a
jirga
(
meeting
)
convened
by
government
officials
,
local
tribal
elders
and
anti-Taliban
groups
.


According
to
witnesses
,
an
undisclosed
number
of
tribal
citizens
,
police
officers
and
at
least
two
journalists
were
amongst
those
killed
.


Eyewitnesses
claimed
that
a
deafening
sound
occurred
followed
by
clouds
of
dust
and
smoke
,
with
dozens
of
people
on
the
ground
,
who
were
bleeding
and
crying
,
with
reports
of
body
parts
scattered
within
the
compound
.


A
local
administration
later
confirmed
to
the
media
that
a
suicide
bomber
on
a
motorbike
had
detonated
his
explosives
,
after
he
had
driven
up
to
a
sitting
area
at
the
meeting
.


Whereas
the
second
suicide
attacker
,
also
on
a
motorcycle
had
detonated
his
explosive
device
at
the
gate
to
this
government
compound
.


It
was
reported
that
both
bombers
were
disguised
in
police
uniforms
.


A
possible
target
for
these
suicide
attacks
was
Mohmand
's
top
political
official
,
Amjad
Ali
Khan
,
who
was
not
killed
or
injured
in
the
attacks
.


Khan
later
confirmed
that
the
suicide
bombers
had
packed
their
suicide
vests
with
ball-bearings
,
thus
increasing
the
number
of
casualties
.


It
was
reported
that
about
25
people
of
whom
were
seriously
injured
in
the
suicide
attacks
were
taken
for
treatment
to
the
Lady
Reading
Hospital
in

On
October
9
,
2008
,
Montenegro
recognized
Kosovo
's
independence
.


This
move
by
the
Montenegrin
government
,
opposed
by
many
in
the
country
,
led
to
a
protest
rally
in
Podgorica
on
October
13
attended
by
over
30,000
people
.


the
rally
,
held
in
front
of
the
parliament
of
montenegro
building
,
was
organized
by
the
serb
list
,
socialist
people
's
party
of
montenegro
,
people
's
party
,
democratic
serb
party
of
montenegro
,
and
other
opposition
parties
.


It
was
backed
by
Movement
for
Changes
and
the
Metropolitanate
of
Montenegro
and
the
Littoral
of
the
Serbian
Orthodox
Church
,
and
Metropolitan
Amfilohije
Radović
was
announced
as
speaker
.


Demonstrators
demanded
that
the
Montenegrin
government
and
Prime
Minister
Milo
Djukanovic
rescind
their
recognition
of
Kosovo
.


They
waved
Serbian
flags
,
chanting
``
Kosovo
is
Serbia
''
and
other
slogans
against
the
prime
minister
and
his
cabinet
,
calling
them
ustashas
and
shiptars
.


at
the
end
of
the
rally
,
riots
broke
out
and
small
groups
attacked
riot
police
in
front
of
the
parliament
building
.


The
rioters
were
eventually
driven
back
by
police
,
and
28
people
were
arrested
.


34
people
were
injured
.


The
opposition
planned
a
second
protest
on
16
October
,
but
the
Montenegrin
police
said
that
no
protests
from
the
opposition
would
be
accepted
.


The
Battle
of
Los
Angeles
,
also
known
as
The
Great
Los
Angeles
Air
Raid
,
is
the
name
given
by
contemporary
sources
to
the
rumored
attack
by
Japan
and
subsequent
anti-aircraft
artillery
barrage
which
took
place
from
late
February
24
to
early
February
25
,
1942
,
over
Los
Angeles
,
California
.


The
incident
occurred
less
than
three
months
after
the
United
States
entered
World
War
II
in
response
to
the
Imperial
Japanese
Navy
's
surprise
attack
on
Pearl
Harbor
,
and
one
day
after
the
bombardment
of
Ellwood
on
February
23
.


Initially
,
the
target
of
the
aerial
barrage
was
thought
to
be
an
attacking
force
from
Japan
,
but
speaking
at
a
press
conference
shortly
afterward
,
Secretary
of
the
Navy
Frank
Knox
called
the
incident
a
``
false
alarm
''
.


Newspapers
of
the
time
published
a
number
of
reports
and
speculations
of
a
cover-up
.


When
documenting
the
incident
in
1949
,
the
United
States
Coast
Artillery
Association
identified
a
meteorological
balloon
sent
up
at
1:00
a.m.
that
``
started
all
the
shooting
''
and
concluded
that
``
once
the
firing
started
,
imagination
created
all
kinds
of
targets
in
the
sky
and
everyone
joined
in
''
.


in
1983
,
the
u.s.
office
of
air
force
history
attributed
the
event
to
a
case
of
``
war
nerves
''
triggered
by
a
lost
weather
balloon
and
exacerbated
by
stray
flares
and
shell
bursts
from
adjoining
batteries
.


The
Wootton
Bassett
SPAD
incident
refers
to
a
railway
incident
in
the
United
Kingdom
on
7
March
2015
,
where
a
steam-hauled
charter
train
passed
a
signal
at
danger
(
SPAD
)
and
subsequently
came
to
a
stand
across
a
high-speed
mainline
junction
.


Another
train
,
that
had
right
of
way
,
had
passed
through
the
junction
44
seconds
earlier
and
no
collision
occurred
nor
was
any
damage
done
.


The
incident
occurred
near
Wootton
Bassett
Junction
,
Wiltshire
.


As
a
direct
result
of
the
incident
Network
Rail
banned
the
train
's
operator
,
West
Coast
Railway
Company
(
WCRC
)
,
from
operating
trains
anywhere
on
the
British
railway
network
.


The
Rail
Accident
Investigation
Branch
(
RAIB
)
opened
an
investigation
into
the
incident
,
which
it
called
a
``
dangerous
occurrence
''
.


The
incident
was
rated
the
most
serious
SPAD
in
the
United
Kingdom
since
December
2010
.


Following
improvements
made
by
WCRC
,
the
ban
was
lifted
.


A
subsequent
incident
led
to
a
further
ban
,
which
was
later
lifted
.


in
december
2015
,
the
office
of
rail
and
road
initiated
a
prosecution
against
the
driver
of
the
train
and
unk
for
offences
under
the
health
and
safety
at
work
act
1974
.


The
case
was
heard
in
June
2016
.


Both
WCRC
and
the
driver
of
the
train
pleaded
guilty
.


WCRC
was
fined
£200,000
plus
costs
.


The
driver
received
a
sentence
of
four
months
'
imprisonment
,
suspended
for
eighteen
months
.


In
May
2016
,
the
RAIB
published
a
report
on
the
incident
,
which
largely
blamed
the
incident
on
the
train
crew
tampering
with
a
safety
system
that
would
otherwise
have
safely
brought
the
train
to
a
halt
.


The
Russian
apartment
bombings
were
a
series
of
explosions
that
hit
four
apartment
blocks
in
the
Russian
cities
of
Buynaksk
,
Moscow
and
Volgodonsk
in
September
1999
,
killing
more
than
300
,
injuring
more
than
1000
,
and
spreading
a
wave
of
fear
across
the
country
.


the
bombings
,
together
with
the
dagestan
war
,
served
as
a
casus
belli
for
the
second
chechen
war
.


Vladimir
Putin
’
s
handling
of
the
crisis
boosted
his
popularity
and
helped
him
attain
the
presidency
within
a
few
months
.


The
blasts
hit
Buynaksk
on
4
September
and
in
Moscow
on
9
and
13
September
.


On
13
September
,
Russian
Duma
speaker
Gennadiy
Seleznyov
made
an
announcement
in
the
Duma
about
receiving
a
report
that
another
bombing
had
just
happened
in
the
city
of
Volgodonsk
.


A
bombing
did
indeed
happen
in
Volgodonsk
,
but
only
three
days
later
,
on
16
September
.


Chechen
militants
were
blamed
for
the
bombings
,
but
denied
responsibility
,
along
with
Chechen
president
Aslan
Maskhadov
.


A
suspicious
device
resembling
those
used
in
these
bombings
was
found
and
defused
in
an
apartment
block
in
the
Russian
city
of
Ryazan
on
22
September
.


The
next
day
,
Vladimir
Putin
praised
the
vigilance
of
the
inhabitants
of
Ryazan
and
ordered
the
air
bombing
of
Grozny
,
which
marked
the
beginning
of
the
Second
Chechen
War
.


Three
FSB
agents
who
had
planted
the
devices
at
Ryazan
were
arrested
by
the
local
police
.


On
September
24
,
1999
,
head
of
FSB
Nikolay
Patrushev
announced
that
the
incident
in
Ryazan
had
been
an
anti-terror
drill
and
the
device
found
there
contained
only
sugar
.


Parliament
member
Yuri
Shchekochikhin
filed
two
motions
for
a
parliamentary
investigation
of
the
events
,
but
the
motions
were
rejected
by
the
Russian
Duma
in
March
2000
.


An
independent
public
commission
to
investigate
the
bombings
was
chaired
by
Duma
deputy
Sergei
Kovalev
.


The
commission
was
rendered
ineffective
because
of
government
refusal
to
respond
to
its
inquiries
.


two
key
members
of
the
kovalev
commission
,
sergei
yushenkov
and
yuri
shchekochikhin
,
have
since
died
in
apparent
assassinations
.


the
commission
UNK
s
lawyer
and
investigator
mikhail
trepashkin
was
arrested
and
served
four
years
in
prison
for
revealing
state
secrets
.


Former
agent
Alexander
Litvinenko
,
who
blamed
FSB
for
the
bombings
in
two
books
,
was
poisoned
by
FSB
agents
in
London
in
2006
.


The
official
Russian
investigation
of
the
bombings
was
completed
in
2002
and
concluded
that
all
the
bombings
were
organised
and
led
by
Achemez
Gochiyaev
,
who
remains
at
large
,
and
ordered
by
Islamist
warlords
Ibn
Al-Khattab
and
Abu
Omar
al-Saif
,
who
have
been
killed
.


Five
other
suspects
have
been
killed
and
six
have
been
convicted
by
Russian
courts
on
terrorism-related
charges
.


According
to
historians
,
the
bombings
were
coordinated
by
the
Russian
state
security
services
to
bring
Putin
into
the
presidency
.


This
view
was
justified
by
a
number
of
suspicious
events
,
including
bombs
planted
by
FSB
agents
in
the
city
of
Ryazan
,
an
announcement
about
bombing
in
the
city
of
Volgodonsk
three
days
before
it
had
happened
by
Russian
Duma
speaker
Gennadiy
Seleznyov
,
weak
evidence
and
denials
by
suspects
none
of
whom
was
a
Chechen
,
and
poisoning
of
Alexander
Litvinenko
who
wrote
two
books
on
the
subject
.


The
1998
Sydney
water
crisis
involved
the
suspected
contamination
by
the
microscopic
pathogens
``
cryptosporidium
''
and
``
giardia
''
of
the
water
supply
system
of
Greater
Metropolitan
Sydney
,
between
July
and
September
1998
.


Following
routine
water
sampling
and
testing
,
over
a
series
of
weeks
low
level
contaminants
were
found
at
Prospect
,
,
Sydney
Hospital
,
the
NSW
Art
Gallery
,
Macquarie
Street
,
Centennial
Park
,
,
,
,
and
water
treatment
facilities
at
Warragamba
,
Nepean
,
,
,
Woronora
,
Macarthur
,
the
Illawarra
and
Prospect
.


The
reliability
of
these
test
results
was
subsequently
called
into
doubt
.


Precautionary
``
boil
water
''
alerts
were
raised
covering
several
suburban
areas
for
the
period
of
the
crisis
.


in
response
to
the
crisis
,
the
government
of
new
south
wales
established
a
commission
of
inquiry
,
chaired
by
jurist
peter
mcclellan
as
commissioner
.


McClennan
handed
down
his
final
report
to
the
NSW
Premier
making
ninetyone
recommendations
that
led
to
the
reorganisation
of
water
supply
and
water
management
functions
and
agencies
in
Greater
Metropolitan
Sydney
via
the
establishment
of
the
Sydney
Catchment
Authority
with
responsibility
for
catchments
,
dams
,
and
bulk
supply
reservoirs
;
while
Sydney
Water
maintained
management
of
water
supply
distribution
,
water
treatment
and
sewerage
,
and
stormwater
management
.


Both
the
Chairman
and
Managing
Director
of
Sydney
Water
stood
down
during
and
following
the
crisis
.


On
February
1
,
2003
,
the
disintegrated
during
atmospheric
entry
,
killing
all
seven
crew
members
.


The
disaster
was
the
second
fatal
accident
in
the
Space
Shuttle
program
,
after
,
which
broke
apart
73
seconds
after
liftoff
and
killed
the
seven-member
crew
in
1986
.


During
the
launch
of
STS-107
,
``
Columbia
''
s
28th
mission
,
a
piece
of
foam
insulation
broke
off
from
the
Space
Shuttle
external
tank
and
struck
the
left
wing
of
the
orbiter
.


A
few
previous
shuttle
launches
had
seen
damage
ranging
from
minor
to
nearly
catastrophic
from
foam
shedding
,
but
some
engineers
suspected
that
the
damage
to
``
Columbia
''
was
more
serious
.


NASA
managers
limited
the
investigation
,
reasoning
that
the
crew
could
not
have
fixed
the
problem
if
it
had
been
confirmed
.


When
``
Columbia
''
re-entered
the
atmosphere
of
Earth
,
the
damage
allowed
hot
atmospheric
gases
to
penetrate
the
heat
shield
and
destroy
the
internal
wing
structure
,
which
caused
the
spacecraft
to
become
unstable
and
break
apart
.


After
the
disaster
,
Space
Shuttle
flight
operations
were
suspended
for
more
than
two
years
,
as
they
had
been
after
the
``
Challenger
''
disaster
.


Construction
of
the
International
Space
Station
(
ISS
)
was
put
on
hold
;
the
station
relied
entirely
on
the
Russian
Roscosmos
State
Space
Corporation
for
resupply
for
29
months
until
Shuttle
flights
resumed
with
STS-114
and
41
months
for
crew
rotation
until
STS-121
.


Several
technical
and
organizational
changes
were
made
,
including
adding
a
thorough
on-orbit
inspection
to
determine
how
well
the
shuttle
's
thermal
protection
system
had
endured
the
ascent
,
and
keeping
a
designated
rescue
mission
ready
in
case
irreparable
damage
was
found
.


Except
for
one
final
mission
to
repair
the
Hubble
Space
Telescope
,
subsequent
shuttle
missions
were
flown
only
to
the
ISS
so
that
the
crew
could
use
it
as
a
haven
in
case
damage
to
the
orbiter
prevented

The
Munich
massacre
was
an
attack
during
the
1972
Summer
Olympics
in
Munich
,
West
Germany
,
in
which
the
Palestinian
terrorist
group
Black
September
took
eleven
Israeli
Olympic
team
members
hostage
and
killed
them
along
with
a
West
German
police
officer
.


Shortly
after
the
crisis
began
,
a
Black
September
spokesman
demanded
that
234
Palestinian
prisoners
jailed
in
Israel
and
the
West
German–held
founders
of
the
Red
Army
Faction
,
Andreas
Baader
and
Ulrike
Meinhof
,
be
released
.


black
september
called
the
operation
``
iqrit
and
biram
''
,
after
two
palestinian
christian
villages
whose
inhabitants
were
expelled
by
the
israel
defense
forces
(
idf
)
during
the
1948
unk
war
.


The
Black
September
commander
,
Luttif
Afif
,
was
born
to
Jewish
and
Christian
parents
.


His
group
was
associated
with
secular
nationalism
,
working
for
the
rights
of
Palestinians
in
Israel
.


West
German
neo-Nazis
gave
the
group
logistical
assistance
.


Police
officers
killed
five
of
the
eight
Black
September
members
during
a
failed
attempt
to
rescue
the
hostages
.


A
West
German
policeman
was
also
killed
in
the
crossfire
.


The
other
three
Palestinian
hijackers
were
captured
.


The
next
month
,
however
,
following
the
hijacking
of
Lufthansa
Flight
615
,
the
West
German
government
released
them
in
a
hostage
exchange
.


Mossad
responded
with
the
1973
Israeli
raid
on
Lebanon
and
Operation
Wrath
of
God
,
tracking
down
and
killing
Palestinians
suspected
of
involvement
in
the
Munich
massacre
.


Two
days
prior
to
the
start
of
the
2016
Summer
Olympics
,
in
a
ceremony
led
by
Brazilian
and
Israeli
officials
,
the
International
Olympic
Committee
honored
the
eleven
Israelis
that
were
killed
at
Munich
.


The
2014
Bukidnon
bus
bombing
occurred
on
December
9
,
2014
when
a
bomb
hit
a
bus
just
in
front
of
the
main
entrance
of
Central
Mindanao
University
along
Sayre
Highway
in
Sitio
Musuan
,
Barangay
Dologon
,
Maramag
,
Bukidnon
.


The
blast
killed
at
least
11
people
and
another
43
were
wounded
.


Most
of
the
victims
were
students
who
were
about
to
go
home
when
the
incident
occurred
.


The
bus
is
owned
by
transport
company
,
Rural
Transit
Mindanao
Incorporated
bearing
the
traffic
number
2640
and
plate
number
KBP-178
.


The
bus
is
en
route
to
Cagayan
de
Oro
from
Banisilan
,
North
Cotabato
.


the
bangsamoro
islamic
freedom
fighters
were
suspected
by
philippine
authorities
to
be
behind
the
bombings
.


Extortion
is
viewed
as
a
motive
for
the
attacks
due
to
claims
that
the
bus
company
has
faced
threats
for
refusing
to
pay
protection
money
to
the
militants
.


The
militant
group
denies
any
involvement
claiming
they
would
not
gain
any
benefit
from
conducting
such
attacks
and
claims
the
accusations
against
them
as
fabrication
.


The
inaugural
Anger
Management
Tour
was
founded
and
started
in
the
fall
of
2000
by
Limp
Bizkit
,
Papa
Roach
,
and
after
the
release
of
``
The
Marshall
Mathers
LP
''
,
Eminem
.


Originally
targeted
at
both
rap
and
rock
fans
,
the
first
``
Anger
Management
''
outing
took
place
in
2000
.


In
the
process
of
starting
the
large
tour
,
Eminem
wanted
to
include
Nine
Inch
Nails
into
the
list
of
artists
,
but
Marilyn
Manson
joining
the
tour
would
raise
the
issues
between
him
and
Trent
Reznor
.


Eminem
decided
to
not
ask
Reznor
to
join
the
tour
due
to
the
friendship
he
has
with
Manson
.


Eminem
also
came
up
with
the
name
for
the
tour
,
being
quoted
in
``
Rolling
Stone
''
saying
``
It
's
the
perfect
name
for
a
tour
like
this
,
because
most
of
the
music
featured
in
the
tour
is
about
anger
,
frustration
,
and
the
bullshit
of
our
lives
and
the
fans
loving
every
minute
of
it
.


It
's
the
blend
of
hardcore
rap
,
industrial
metal
,
and
alternative
metal
that
gives
it
the
anger
management
feel
,
literally
.
''


In
the
first
tour
,
most
of
the
concerts
were
extremely
long
,
due
to
the
number
of
artists
that
were
chosen
to
headline
the
massive
tour
.


Many
of
the
concerts
were
praised
for
the
production
value
and
how
each
artist
played
like
it
was
their
own
tour
.


Many
critics
agreed
that
one
of
the
great
things
about
the
concerts
were
that
they
felt
like
they
were
made
up
of
mini
concerts
.


The
second
tour
took
place
in
the
summer
of
2002
.


Eminem
told
LAUNCH
,
``
It
's
basically
the
same
thing
that
it
was
the
last
Anger
Management
Tour
without
Limp
Bizkit
...
Papa
Roach
are
still
cool
though
.
''


These
concerts
on
the
second
tour
were
infamously
just
as
long
as
the
first
time
around
,
which
in
turn
led
to
a
controversial
incident
during
a
European
Leg
of
the
tour
.


During
a
stop
in
Milton
Keynes
,
UK
,
fans
grew
restless
and
agitated
at
the
prolonged
'stage
changeovers
'
between
artists
and
proceeded
to
throw
bottles
of
liquid
(
liquor
,
water
,
and
urine
)
at
the
stage
.


It
is
thought
one
of
these
bottles
of
liquid
hit
rapper
Xzibit
during
his
set
,
causing
him
to
leave
the
stage
having
suffered
a
broken
jaw
.


The
bottle
throwing
incident
in
Milton
Keynes
was
referenced
by
Eminem
and
D12
in
a
song
titled
'American
Psycho
2
'
,
in
which
Em
retorts
'go
find
out
who
did
that
shit
to
Xzibit
,
fill
up
a
whole
liquor
bottle
of
piss
and
shatter
his
fucking
face
'
The
third
tour
took
place
in
the
summer
of
2005
.


50
Cent
missed
the
tour
's
first
two
stops
because
of
a
scheduling
conflict
;
he
was
tied
up
shooting
his
film
debut
.


Ludacris
filled
in
on
those
dates
.


The
European
part
of
the
tour
was
cut
short
due
to
the
exhaustion
of
tour
founder
Eminem
and
his
addiction
to
sleeping
pills
.

The
Aragonese
Crusade
or
Crusade
of
Aragon
,
a
part
of
the
larger
War
of
the
Sicilian
Vespers
,
was
declared
by
Pope
Martin
IV
against
the
King
of
Aragon
,
Peter
III
the
Great
,
in
1284
and
1285
.


Because
of
the
recent
conquest
of
Sicily
by
Peter
,
the
Pope
declared
a
crusade
against
him
and
officially
deposed
him
as
king
,
on
the
grounds
that
Aragon
was
a
papal
fief
:
Peter
's
grandfather
and
namesake
,
Peter
II
,
had
surrendered
the
kingdom
as
a
fief
to
the
Holy
See
.


Martin
bestowed
Aragon
on
Charles
,
Count
of
Valois
,
son
of
the
French
king
,
Philip
III
,
and
nephew
of
Peter
III
.


The
crusade
soon
caused
civil
war
within
Aragon
,
as
Peter
's
brother
,
King
James
II
of
Majorca
,
joined
the
French
.


James
had
also
inherited
the
County
of
Roussillon
and
thus
stood
between
the
dominions
of
the
French
and
Aragonese
monarchs
.


Peter
had
opposed
James
'
inheritance
as
a
younger
son
and
reaped
the
consequence
of
such
rivalry
in
the
crusade
.


Peter
's
eldest
son
,
the
future
Alfonso
III
,
was
placed
in
charge
of
defending
the
border
with
Navarre
,
which
was
ruled
by
Philip
III
's
son
,
Philip
the
Fair
.


although
peter
feared
a
full-scale
invasion
from
navarre
,
there
were
only
some
cross-border
raids
.


The
Navarrese
king
joined
the
main
invading
army
under
his
father
.


In
1284
,
the
first
French
armies
under
Philip
and
Charles
entered
Roussillon
.


They
included
16,000
cavalry
,
17,000
crossbowmen
,
and
100,000
infantry
,
along
with
100
ships
in
south
French
ports
.


though
they
had
james
'
support
,
the
local
populace
rose
against
them
.


The
city
of
Elne
was
valiantly
defended
by
the
so-called
``
Bâtard
de
Roussillon
''
(
Bastard
of
Roussillon
)
,
the
illegitimate
son
of
Nuño
Sánchez
,
late
count
of
Roussillon
(
1212–1242
)
.


Eventually
he
was
overcome
and
the
cathedral
was
burned
,
despite
the
presence
of
papal
legates
,
while
the
population
was
massacred
,
all
save
the
``
Bâtard
''
.


He
succeeded
in
negotiating
his
surrender
and
accompanied
the
advancing
royal
forces
as
a
prisoner
.


In
1285
,
Philip
the
Bold
entrenched
himself
before
Girona
in
an
attempt
to
besiege
it
.


The
resistance
was
strong
,
but
the
city
was
taken
.


Charles
was
crowned
there
,
but
without
an
actual
crown
.


On
28
April
,
Cardinal
Jean
Cholet
placed
his
own
hat
on
the
count
's
head
.


For
this
,
Charles
was
derisively
but
not
unaffectionately
nicknamed
``
roi
du
chapeau
''
(
``
king
of
the
hat
''
)
.


The
French
soon
experienced
a
reversal
,
however
,
at
the
hands
of
Peter
III
's
admiral
,
Roger
de
Lauria
.


The
French
fleet
was
defeated
and
destroyed
at
the
Battle
of
Les
Formigues
.


As
well
,
the
French
camp
was
hit
hard
by
an
epidemic
of
dysentery
.


Philip
himself
was
afflicted
.


The
heir
to
the
French
throne
,
Philip
of
Navarre
,
opened
negotiations
with
Peter
for
free
passage
for
the
royal
family
through
the
Pyrenees
.


But
the
troops
were
not
offered
such
passage
and
were
decimated
at
the
Battle
of
the
Col
de
Panissars
.


The
king
of
France
himself
died
at
Perpignan
,
the
capital
of
James
of
Majorca
,
and
was
buried
in
Narbonne
.


Peter
did
not
long
survive
him
.


Historian
H.
J.
Chaytor
described
the
Aragonese
Crusade
as
``
perhaps
the
most
unjust
,
unnecessary
and
calamitous
enterprise
ever
undertaken
by
the
Capetian
monarchy
.
''


W.
C.
Jordan
has
blamed
it
for
the
young
Philip
's
opposition
to
papal
interference
in
French
foreign
policy
upon
his
succession
,
which
had
long-reaching
consequences
for
Europe
.


The
crusade
's
legacy
to
France
was
slight
,
but
Majorca
was
devastated
as
an
independent
polity
.


Alfonso
III
annexed
Majorca
,
Ibiza
,
and
Menorca
in
the
following
years
.


in
1295
,
the
treaty
of
anagni
returned
the
islands
to
james
and
the
treaty
of
tarascon
of
1291
officially
restored
aragon
to
alfonso
and
lifted
the
ban
of
the
church
.


The
2007
Boston
Mooninite
panic
occurred
on
Wednesday
,
January
31
,
2007
,
after
the
Boston
Police
Department
and
the
Boston
Fire
Department
mistakenly
identified
battery-powered
LED
placards
depicting
the
Mooninites
,
characters
from
the
Adult
Swim
animated
television
series
``
Aqua
Teen
Hunger
Force
''
,
as
improvised
explosive
devices
.


placed
throughout
boston
,
massachusetts
,
and
the
surrounding
cities
of
cambridge
and
somerville
,
these
devices
were
part
of
a
guerrilla
marketing
advertising
campaign
for
``
aqua
teen
hunger
force
colon
movie
film
for
theaters
''
,
a
film
based
on
``
aqua
teen
hunger
force
''
.


the
incident
led
to
controversy
and
criticism
from
a
number
of
media
sources
,
including
``
the
boston
globe
''
,
``
los
angeles
times
''
,
fox
news
,
``
the
san
francisco
chronicle
''
,
``
the
new
york
times
''
,
cnn
and
``
the
boston
herald
''
,
some
of
which
ridiculed
the
city
's
response
to
the
devices
as
disproportionate
and
indicative
of
a
generation
gap
between
city
officials
and
the
younger
residents
of
boston
,
at
whom
the
ads
were
targeted
.


Several
sources
noted
that
the
hundreds
of
officers
in
the
Boston
police
department
or
city
emergency
planning
office
on
scene
were
unable
to
identify
the
figure
depicted
for
several
hours
until
a
young
staffer
at
Mayor
Thomas
Menino
's
office
saw
the
media
coverage
and
recognized
the
figures
as
cartoon
characters
from
the
TV
show
.


After
the
devices
were
removed
,
the
Boston
Police
Department
stated
in
their
defense
that
the
ad
devices
shared
``
some
characteristics
with
improvised
explosive
devices
,
''
which
they
said
included
an
``
identifiable
power
source
,
a
circuit
board
with
exposed
wiring
,
and
electrical
tape
.
''


Investigators
were
not
mollified
by
the
discovery
that
the
devices
were
not
explosive
in
nature
,
stating
they
still
intended
to
determine
``
if
this
event
was
a
hoax
or
something
else
entirely
.
''


although
city
prosecutors
eventually
concluded
there
was
no
ill
intent
involved
in
the
placing
of
the
ads
,
the
city
continues
to
refer
to
the
event
as
a
``
bomb
hoax
''
(
implying
intent
)
rather
than
a
``
bomb
scare
.
''


Reflecting
back
on
the
incident
years
later
,
various
academics
and
media
sources
have
characterized
the
reaction
to
the
marketing
campaign
as
a
form
of
social
panic
.


Author
Gregory
Bergman
wrote
in
his
2008
book
``
BizzWords
''
that
the
devices
were
basically
a
self-made
form
of
the
children
's
toy
Lite-Brite
.


Computer
security
expert
Bruce
Schneier
wrote
in
his
2009
book
``
Schneier
on
Security
''
that
Boston
officials
were
``
ridiculed
''
for
their
overreaction
to
the
incident
.


In
his
2009
book
``
Secret
Agents
''
,
historian
and
communication
professor
Jeremy
Packer
discussed
a
phenomenon
in
culture
called
the
``
panic
discourse
''
and
described
the
incident
as
a
``
spectacular
instance
of
this
panic
''
.


In
a
2012
article
``
The
Boston
Phoenix
''
called
the
incident
the
``
Great
Mooninite
Panic
of
2007
''
.


A
2013
publication
by
WGBH
News
wrote
that
the
majority
of
Boston
youth
thought
that
the
arrests
of
two
men
who
placed
devices
,
Peter
``
Zebbler
''
Berdovsky
and
Sean
Stevens
,
were
not
warranted
.


The
February
2010
Australian
cyberattacks
were
a
series
of
denial-of-service
attacks
conducted
by
the
Anonymous
online
community
against
the
Australian
government
in
response
to
proposed
web
censorship
regulations
.


Operation
Titstorm
was
the
name
given
to
the
cyber
attacks
by
the
perpetrators
.


They
resulted
in
lapses
of
access
to
government
websites
on
10
and
11
February
2010
.


This
was
accompanied
by
emails
,
faxes
,
and
phone
calls
harassing
government
offices
.


The
actual
size
of
the
attack
and
number
of
perpetrators
involved
is
unknown
but
it
was
estimated
that
the
number
of
systems
involved
ranged
from
the
hundreds
to
the
thousands
.


The
amount
of
traffic
caused
disruption
on
multiple
government
websites
.


Australian
Telecommunications
Minister
Stephen
Conroy
proposed
the
regulations
that
would
mainly
filter
sites
with
pornographic
content
.


Various
groups
advocating
uncensored
access
to
the
Internet
,
along
with
companies
like
Google
and
Yahoo
!
,
object
to
the
proposed
filter
.


A
spokesperson
for
Conroy
said
that
the
actions
were
not
a
legitimate
form
of
protest
and
called
it
irresponsible
.


The
attacks
also
drew
criticism
from
other
filter
protest
groups
.


The
initial
stage
was
followed
by
small
in-person
protests
on
20
February
that
were
called
``
Project
Freeweb
''
.


the
peasants
'
revolt
,
also
named
wat
tyler
's
rebellion
or
the
great
rising
,
was
a
major
uprising
across
large
parts
of
england
in
1381
.


The
revolt
had
various
causes
,
including
the
socio-economic
and
political
tensions
generated
by
the
Black
Death
in
the
1340s
,
the
high
taxes
resulting
from
the
conflict
with
France
during
the
Hundred
Years
'
War
,
and
instability
within
the
local
leadership
of
London
.


The
final
trigger
for
the
revolt
was
the
intervention
of
a
royal
official
,
John
Bampton
,
in
Essex
on
30
May
1381
.


His
attempts
to
collect
unpaid
poll
taxes
in
Brentwood
ended
in
a
violent
confrontation
,
which
rapidly
spread
across
the
south-east
of
the
country
.


A
wide
spectrum
of
rural
society
,
including
many
local
artisans
and
village
officials
,
rose
up
in
protest
,
burning
court
records
and
opening
the
local
gaols
.


The
rebels
sought
a
reduction
in
taxation
,
an
end
to
the
system
of
unfree
labour
known
as
serfdom
,
and
the
removal
of
the
King
's
senior
officials
and
law
courts
.


Inspired
by
the
sermons
of
the
radical
cleric
John
Ball
and
led
by
Wat
Tyler
,
a
contingent
of
Kentish
rebels
advanced
on
London
.


They
were
met
at
Blackheath
by
representatives
of
the
royal
government
,
who
unsuccessfully
attempted
to
persuade
them
to
return
home
.


King
Richard
II
,
then
aged
14
,
retreated
to
the
safety
of
the
Tower
of
London
,
but
most
of
the
royal
forces
were
abroad
or
in
northern
England
.


On
13
June
,
the
rebels
entered
London
and
,
joined
by
many
local
townsfolk
,
attacked
the
gaols
,
destroyed
the
Savoy
Palace
,
set
fire
to
law
books
and
buildings
in
the
Temple
,
and
killed
anyone
associated
with
the
royal
government
.


The
following
day
,
Richard
met
the
rebels
at
Mile
End
and
acceded
to
most
of
their
demands
,
including
the
abolition
of
serfdom
.


Meanwhile
,
rebels
entered
the
Tower
of
London
,
killing
the
Lord
Chancellor
and
the
Lord
High
Treasurer
,
whom
they
found
inside
.


On
15
June
,
Richard
left
the
city
to
meet
Tyler
and
the
rebels
at
Smithfield
.


Violence
broke
out
,
and
Richard
's
party
killed
Tyler
.


Richard
defused
the
tense
situation
long
enough
for
London
's
mayor
,
William
Walworth
,
to
gather
a
militia
from
the
city
and
disperse
the
rebel
forces
.


Richard
immediately
began
to
re-establish
order
in
London
and
rescinded
his
previous
grants
to
the
rebels
.


The
revolt
had
also
spread
into
East
Anglia
,
where
the
University
of
Cambridge
was
attacked
and
many
royal
officials
were
killed
.


Unrest
continued
until
the
intervention
of
Henry
Despenser
,
who
defeated
a
rebel
army
at
the
Battle
of
North
Walsham
on
25
or
26
June
.


Troubles
extended
north
to
York
,
Beverley
and
Scarborough
,
and
as
far
west
as
Bridgwater
in
Somerset
.


Richard
mobilised
4,000
soldiers
to
restore
order
.


Most
of
the
rebel
leaders
were
tracked
down
and
executed
;
by
November
,
at
least
1,500
rebels
had
been
killed
.


The
Peasants
'
Revolt
has
been
widely
studied
by
academics
.


Late
19th-century
historians
used
a
range
of
sources
from
contemporary
chroniclers
to
assemble
an
account
of
the
uprising
,
and
these
were
supplemented
in
the
20th
century
by
research
using
court
records
and
local
archives
.


Interpretations
of
the
revolt
have
shifted
over
the
years
.


It
was
once
seen
as
a
defining
moment
in
English
history
,
but
modern
academics
are
less
certain
of
its
impact
on
subsequent
social
and
economic
history
.


The
revolt
heavily
influenced
the
course
of
the
Hundred
Years
'
War
,
by
deterring
later
Parliaments
from
raising
additional
taxes
to
pay
for
military
campaigns
in
France
.


The
revolt
has
been
widely
used
in
socialist
literature
,
including
by
the
author
William
Morris
,
and
remains
a
potent
political
symbol
for
the
political
left
,
informing
the
arguments
surrounding
the
introduction
of
the
Community
Charge
in
the
United
Kingdom
during
the
1980s
.


The
First
Intifada
or
First
Palestinian
Intifada
(
also
known
simply
as
the
intifada
or
intifadah
)
was
a
Palestinian
uprising
against
the
Israeli
occupation
of
the
West
Bank
and
Gaza
.


the
uprising
lasted
from
december
1987
until
the
madrid
conference
in
1991
,
though
some
date
its
conclusion
to
1993
,
with
the
signing
of
the
oslo
accords
.


the
uprising
began
on
9
december
1987
,
in
the
jabalia
refugee
camp
after
an
israeli
defense
forces
'
(
idf
)
truck
collided
with
a
civilian
car
,
killing
four
palestinians
.


in
the
wake
of
the
incident
,
a
protest
movement
arose
,
involving
a
two-fold
strategy
of
resistance
and
civil
disobedience
,
consisting
of
general
strikes
,
boycotts
of
israeli
civil
administration
institutions
in
the
gaza
strip
and
the
west
bank
,
an
economic
boycott
consisting
of
refusal
to
work
in
israeli
settlements
on
israeli
products
,
refusal
to
pay
taxes
,
refusal
to
drive
palestinian
cars
with
israeli
licenses
,
graffiti
,
barricading
,
and
widespread
throwing
of
stones
and
molotov
cocktails
at
the
idf
and
its
infrastructure
within
the
west
bank
and
gaza
strip
.


Israel
,
deploying
some
80,000
soldiers
and
initially
firing
live
rounds
,
killed
a
large
number
of
Palestinians
.


In
the
first
13
months
,
332
Palestinians
and
12
Israelis
were
killed
.


Given
the
high
proportion
of
children
,
youths
and
civilians
killed
,
it
then
adopted
a
policy
of
'might
,
power
,
and
beatings
,
'
namely
``
breaking
Palestinians
'
bones
''
.


The
global
diffusion
of
images
of
soldiers
beating
adolescents
with
clubs
then
led
to
the
adoption
of
firing
semi-lethal
plastic
bullets
.


In
the
intifada
's
first
year
,
Israeli
security
forces
killed
311
Palestinians
,
of
which
53
were
under
the
age
of
17
.


over
the
first
two
years
,
according
to
save
the
children
,
an
estimated
7
%
of
all
palestinians
under
18
years
of
age
suffered
injuries
from
shootings
,
beatings
,
or
tear
gas
.


over
six
years
the
idf
killed
an
estimated
unk
palestinians
.


Between
23,600–29,900
Palestinian
children
required
medical
treatment
from
IDF
beatings
in
the
first
2
years
.


Among
Israelis
,
100
civilians
and
60
IDF
personnel
were
killed
often
by
militants
outside
the
control
of
the
Intifada
's
UNLU
,
and
more
than
1,400
Israeli
civilians
and
1,700
soldiers
were
injured
.


Intra-Palestinian
violence
was
also
a
prominent
feature
of
the
Intifada
,
with
widespread
executions
of
an
estimated
822
Palestinians
killed
as
alleged
Israeli
collaborators
(
1988–April
1994
)
.


At
the
time
Israel
reportedly
obtained
information
from
some
18,000
Palestinians
who
had
been
compromised
,
although
fewer
than
half
had
any
proven
contact
with
the
Israeli
authorities
.


The
ensuing
Second
Intifada
took
place
from
September
2000
to
2005
.


The
Bradford
City
stadium
fire
was
an
accidental
conflagration
which
occurred
during
an
English
League
Third
Division
match
between
Bradford
City
and
Lincoln
City
on
Saturday
,
11
May
1985
,
killing
56
spectators
in
the
stadium
and
injuring
at
least
265
.


The
Valley
Parade
stadium
,
the
long-established
home
to
Bradford
City
Football
Club
,
in
common
with
many
other
British
football
stadiums
of
the
time
,
was
known
for
its
antiquated
design
and
facilities
,
which
included
the
wooden
roof
of
the
main
stand
.


Previous
warnings
had
also
been
given
about
a
major
build-up
of
litter
in
the
cavity
below
the
seats
in
the
stand
.


The
stand
had
been
officially
condemned
and
was
due
to
be
replaced
with
a
steel
structure
after
the
football
season
ended
.


The
match
against
Lincoln
City
,
the
final
game
of
that
season
,
had
started
in
a
celebratory
atmosphere
with
the
home-team
receiving
the
Football
League
Third
Division
trophy
.


at
3.40
p.m.
,
a
small
fire
in
the
main
stand
was
remarked
upon
by
the
tv
commentator
john
helm
,
but
in
less
than
four
minutes
,
with
the
windy
conditions
,
it
had
entirely
engulfed
the
whole
stand
,
trapping
some
people
in
their
seats
.


In
the
mass
panic
that
ensued
,
fleeing
crowds
escaped
on
to
the
pitch
but
others
at
the
back
of
the
stand
tried
to
break
down
locked
exit
doors
to
escape
,
and
many
were
burnt
to
death
at
the
turnstiles
gates
,
which
had
also
been
locked
after
the
match
had
begun
.


There
were
many
cases
of
heroism
,
with
more
than
50
people
later
receiving
police
awards
or
commendations
for
bravery
.


The
disaster
led
to
rigid
new
safety
standards
in
UK
stadiums
,
including
the
banning
of
new
wooden
grandstands
.


It
was
also
a
catalyst
for
the
substantial
redevelopment
and
modernisation
of
many
British
football
grounds
within
the
following
thirty
years
.

The
Battles
of
Frenchtown
,
also
known
as
the
Battle
of
the
River
Raisin
and
the
River
Raisin
Massacre
,
was
a
series
of
conflicts
in
Michigan
Territory
that
took
place
from
January
18–23
,
1813
,
during
the
War
of
1812
.


It
was
fought
between
the
United
States
and
a
British
and
Native
American
alliance
near
the
River
Raisin
in
Frenchtown
,
(
present-day
Monroe
,
Michigan
)
.


On
January
18
,
1813
,
the
Americans
forced
the
retreat
of
the
British
and
their
Native
American
allies
from
Frenchtown
,
which
they
had
earlier
occupied
,
in
a
relatively
minor
skirmish
.


The
movement
was
part
of
a
larger
United
States
plan
to
advance
north
and
retake
Fort
Detroit
,
following
its
loss
in
the
Siege
of
Detroit
the
previous
summer
.


Despite
this
initial
success
,
the
British
and
Native
Americans
rallied
and
launched
a
surprise
counterattack
four
days
later
on
January
22
.


Ill-prepared
,
the
Americans
lost
397
soldiers
in
this
second
battle
,
while
547
were
taken
prisoner
.


Dozens
of
wounded
prisoners
were
murdered
the
next
day
in
a
massacre
by
the
Native
Americans
.


More
prisoners
were
killed
if
they
could
not
keep
up
on
the
forced
march
to
Fort
Malden
.


this
was
the
deadliest
conflict
recorded
on
michigan
soil
,
and
the
casualties
included
the
highest
number
of
americans
killed
in
a
single
battle
during
the
war
of
1812
.


Parts
of
the
original
battlefield
were
designated
as
a
state
historic
park
and
added
to
the
National
Register
of
Historic
Places
.


in
2009
congress
authorized

such
parks
in
the
nation

The
cross-country
skiing
events
at
the
2002
Winter
Olympics
were
marred
by
drug
problems

The
winners
of

were
disqualified
after
blood
tests
showed
that
three
skiers
had
overly
high
red
blood
cell
counts
indicating
the
use
of
darbepoetin
,
a
drug
used
to

.


At
the
time
,
the
drug
was
not
specifically
listed
in

list
of
banned
substances
,
but
the
Olympic
rules
generally
prohibit
doping
of
any
kind
,
in

with
its
charter
.


After
two
years
and

,
the
skiers
in
question
(

the
algerian
war
,
also
known
as
the
algerian
war
of
independence
or
the
algerian
revolution
(
'
;
'
;
or
``
''
)
was
fought
between
france
and
the
algerian
national
liberation
front
(
UNK
fln
)
from
1954
to
1962
,
which
led
to
algeria
gaining
its
independence
from
france
.


An
important
decolonization
war
,
it
was
a
complex
conflict
characterized
by
guerrilla
warfare
,
fighting
,
and
the
use
of
torture
.


The
conflict
also
became
a
civil
war
between
the
different
communities
and
within
the
communities
.


The
war
took
place
mainly
on
the
territory
of
Algeria
,
with
repercussions
in
metropolitan
France
.


Effectively
started
by
members
of
the
National
Liberation
Front
(
FLN
)
on
1
November
1954
,
during
the
(
``
Red
All
Saints
'
Day
''
)
,
the
conflict
led
to
serious
political
crises
in
France
,
causing
the
fall
of
the
Fourth
French
Republic
(
1946–58
)
replaced
by
the
Fifth
Republic
with
a
strengthened
Presidency
.


The
brutality
of
the
methods
employed
by
the
French
forces
failed
to
win
hearts
and
minds
in
Algeria
,
alienated
support
in
metropolitan
France
and
discredited
French
prestige
abroad
.


After
major
demonstrations
in
Algiers
and
several
other
cities
in
favor
of
independence
(
1960
)
and
a
United
Nations
resolution
recognizing
the
right
to
independence
,
Charles
de
Gaulle
,
the
first
President
of
the
Fifth
Republic
,
decided
to
open
a
series
of
negotiations
with
the
FLN
.


These
concluded
with
the
signing
of
the
Évian
Accords
in
March
1962
.


A
referendum
took
place
on
8
April
1962
and
the
French
electorate
approved
the
Évian
Accords
.


The
final
result
was
91
%
in
favor
of
the
ratification
of
this
agreement
and
on
1
July
,
the
Accords
were
subject
to
a
second
referendum
in
Algeria
,
where
99.72
%
voted
for
independence
and
just
0.28
%
against
.


The
planned
French
withdrawal
led
to
a
state
crisis
.


This
included
various
assassination
attempts
on
de
Gaulle
as
well
as
some
attempts
at
military
coups
.


Most
of
the
former
were
carried
out
by
the
(
OAS
)
,
an
underground
organization
formed
mainly
from
French
military
personnel
supporting
a
French
Algeria
,
which
committed
a
large
number
of
bombings
and
murders
both
in
Algeria
and
in
the
homeland
to
stop
the
planned
independence
.


upon
independence
in
1962
,
900,000
unk
(
``
''
)
fled
to
france
within
a
few
months
in
fear
of
the
fln
's
revenge
.


The
French
government
was
totally
unprepared
for
the
vast
number
of
refugees
,
which
caused
turmoil
in
France
.


The
majority
of
Algerian
Muslims
who
had
worked
for
the
French
were
disarmed
and
left
behind
as
the
treaty
between
French
and
Algerian
authorities
declared
that
no
actions
could
be
taken
against
them
.


However
,
the
Harkis
in
particular
,
having
served
as
auxiliaries
with
the
French
army
,
were
regarded
as
traitors
and
many
were
murdered
by
the
FLN
or
by
lynch-mobs
,
often
after
being
abducted
and
tortured
.


About
90,000
managed
to
flee
to
France
,
some
with
help
from
their
French
officers
acting
against
orders
,
and
they
and
their
descendants
form
a
significant
part
of
the
Algerian-French
population
.


The
First
Opium
War
(
)
,
also
known
as
the
Opium
War
or
the
Anglo-Chinese
War
,
was
a
series
of
military
engagements
fought
between
Great
Britain
and
the
Qing
dynasty
of
China
.


Chinese
officials
clamped
down
on
the
banned
opium
trade
,
and
threatened
the
death
penalty
to
future
offenders
,
causing
offence
toward
the
British
government
.


The
British
dominated
the
trade
and
were
much
stronger
militarily
.


They
defeated
the
Chinese
,
and
imposed
a
penalty
that
gave
Western
powers
special
privileges
to
trade
with
China
.


The
demand
for
Chinese
luxury
goods
(
particularly
silk
,
porcelain
,
and
tea
)
created
a
trade
imbalance
between
China
and
Britain
.


European
silver
flowed
into
China
through
the
Canton
System
,
which
confined
incoming
foreign
trade
to
the
southern
port
city
of
Canton
.


To
counter
this
imbalance
,
the
British
East
India
Company
began
to
grow
opium
in
Bengal
,
in
present
day
Bangladesh
,
and
allowed
private
British
merchants
to
smuggle
it
into
China
illegally
.


The
influx
of
narcotics
reversed
the
Chinese
trade
surplus
,
drained
the
economy
of
silver
,
and
increased
the
numbers
of
opium
addicts
inside
the
country
,
outcomes
that
seriously
worried
Chinese
officials
.


In
1839
,
the
Daoguang
Emperor
,
rejecting
proposals
to
legalize
and
tax
opium
,
appointed
viceroy
Lin
Zexu
to
go
to
Canton
to
halt
the
opium
trade
completely
.


Lin
wrote
to
Queen
Victoria
an
open
letter
in
an
appeal
to
her
moral
responsibility
to
stop
the
opium
trade
.


When
he
failed
to
get
a
response
,
he
initially
attempted
to
get
foreign
companies
to
forfeit
their
opium
stores
in
exchange
for
tea
,
but
this
ultimately
failed
too
.


Then
Lin
resorted
to
using
force
in
the
western
merchants
'
enclave
.


He
confiscated
all
supplies
and
ordered
a
blockade
of
foreign
ships
to
get
them
to
surrender
their
opium
supply
.


Lin
confiscated
20,283
chests
of
opium
(
approximately
1210
tons
or
2.66
million
pounds
)
.


The
British
government
responded
by
dispatching
a
military
force
to
China
and
in
the
ensuing
conflict
,
the
Royal
Navy
used
its
naval
and
gunnery
power
to
inflict
a
series
of
decisive
defeats
on
the
Chinese
Empire
,
a
tactic
later
referred
to
as
gunboat
diplomacy
.


in
1842
,
the
qing
dynasty
was
forced
to
sign
the
treaty
of
unk
first
of
what
the
chinese
later
called
the
unequal
unk
granted
an
indemnity
and
extraterritoriality
to
britain
,
opened
five
treaty
ports
to
foreign
merchants
,
and
ceded
hong
kong
island
to
the
british
empire
.


The
failure
of
the
treaty
to
satisfy
British
goals
of
improved
trade
and
diplomatic
relations
led
to
the
Second
Opium
War
(
1856–60
)
,
and
the
perceived
weakness
of
the
Qing
dynasty
resulted
in
social
unrest
within
China
,
namely
the
Taiping
Rebellion
,
during
which
the
Qing
dynasty
fought
against
the
Taiping
Heavenly
Kingdom
.


In
China
,
the
war
is
considered
the
beginning
of
modern
Chinese
history
.


The
Nuclear

programme
refers
to
an
active
military
programme
directed
towards
the
development
of
techniques
of
experimenting
nuclear
forces
and
further
investigations
of
the
blast
effects
.


the
programme
was
suggested
and
idealized
by
munir
ahmad
unk
chairman
of
pakistan
atomic
energy
commission
(
paec
)
UNK
as
early
as
1977
.


First
subcritical
tests
were
carried
out
in
1983
by
the
PAEC
,
codename
as
Kirana-I
,
continued
until
the
1990s
under
Prime
Minister
Benazir
Bhutto
.


Further
claims
of
conducting
subcritical
tests
at
Kahuta
were
made
in
1984
by
KRL
but
were
dismissed
by
the
government

authorized
the
programme
jointly
under
PAEC
and
KRL
,
assisted
by

There
were
six

The
dissolution
of
the
Soviet
Union
was
the
process
of
internal
disintegration
within
the
Union
of
Soviet
Socialist
Republics
(
USSR
)
which
began
in
second
half
of
the
1980s
with
growing
unrest
in
the
national
republics
and
ended
on
26
December
1991
,
when
the
USSR
itself
was
voted
out
of
existence
by
the
Supreme
Soviet
,
following
the
Belavezha
Accords
.


Declaration
number
142-Н
by
the
Supreme
Soviet
resulted
in
self-governing
independence
to
the
Republics
of
the
USSR
,
formally
dissolving
the
USSR
.


The
declaration
acknowledged
the
independence
of
the
former
Soviet
republics
and
created
the
Commonwealth
of
Independent
States
(
CIS
)
,
although
five
of
the
signatories
ratified
it
much
later
or
did
not
do
so
at
all
.


On
the
previous
day
,
25
December
,
Soviet
President
Mikhail
Gorbachev
,
the
eighth
and
final
leader
of
the
USSR
,
resigned
,
declared
his
office
extinct
and
handed
over
its
powers—including
control
of
the
Soviet
nuclear
missile
launching
codes—to
Russian
President
Boris
Yeltsin
.


That
evening
at
7:32
p.m.
,
the
Soviet
flag
was
lowered
from
the
Kremlin
for
the
last
time
and
replaced
with
the
pre-revolutionary
Russian
flag
.


previously
,
from
august
to
december
,
all
the
individual
republics
,
including
russia
itself
,
had
either
seceded
from
the
union
or
at
the
very
least
denounced
the
treaty
on
the
creation
of
the
ussr
.


The
week
before
formal
dissolution
,
eleven
republics
signed
the
Alma-Ata
Protocol
formally
establishing
the
CIS
and
declaring
that
the
USSR
had
ceased
to
exist
.


Both
the
Revolutions
of
1989
and
the
dissolution
of
the
USSR
also
marked
the
end
of
the
Cold
War
.


Several
of
the
former
Soviet
republics
have
retained
close
links
with
the
Russian
Federation
and
formed
multilateral
organizations
such
as
the
Commonwealth
of
Independent
States
,
Eurasian
Economic
Community
,
the
Union
State
,
the
Eurasian
Customs
Union
and
the
Eurasian
Economic
Union
to
enhance
economic
and
security
cooperation

The
Pomeranian
War
was
a
theatre
of
the
Seven
Years
'
War
.


The
term
is
used
to
describe
the
fighting
between
Sweden
and
Prussia
between
1757
and
1762
in
Swedish
Pomerania
,
Prussian
Pomerania
,
northern
Brandenburg
and
eastern
Mecklenburg-Schwerin
.


The
war
was
characterized
by
a
back-and-forth
movement
of
the
Swedish
and
Prussian
armies
,
neither
of
whom
would
score
a
decisive
victory
.


It
started
when
Swedish
forces
advanced
into
Prussian
territory
in
1757
,
but
were
repelled
and
blockaded
at
Stralsund
until
their
relief
by
a
Russian
force
in
1758
.


In
the
course
of
the
following
,
renewed
Swedish
incursion
into
Prussian
territory
,
the
small
Prussian
fleet
was
destroyed
and
areas
as
far
south
as
Neuruppin
were
occupied
,
yet
the
campaign
was
aborted
in
late
1759
when
the
undersupplied
Swedish
forces
succeeded
neither
in
taking
the
major
Prussian
fortress
of
Stettin
(
now
Szczecin
)
nor
in
combining
with
their
Russian
allies
.


A
Prussian
counter-attack
of
Swedish
Pomerania
in
January
1760
was
repelled
,
and
throughout
the
year
Swedish
forces
again
advanced
into
Prussian
territory
as
far
south
as
Prenzlau
before
again
withdrawing
to
Swedish
Pomerania
in
the
winter
.


Another
Swedish
campaign
into
Prussia
started
in
the
summer
of
1761
,
but
was
soon
aborted
due
to
shortage
of
supplies
and
equipment
.


The
final
encounters
of
the
war
took
place
in
the
winter
of
1761/62
near
Malchin
and
Neukalen
in
Mecklenburg
,
just
across
the
Swedish
Pomeranian
border
,
before
the
parties
agreed
on
the
Truce
of
Ribnitz
on
7
April
1762
.


When
on
5
May
a
Russo-Prussian
alliance
eliminated
Swedish
hopes
for
future
Russian
assistance
,
and
instead
posed
the
threat
of
a
Russian
intervention
on
the
Prussian
side
,
Sweden
was
forced
to
make
peace
.


The
war
was
formally
ended
on
22
May
1762
by
the
Peace
of
Hamburg
between
Prussia
,
Mecklenburg
and
Sweden
.


The
hopes
of
the
Swedish
Hats
party
to
recover
territories
lost
to
Prussia
in
1720
were
thwarted
,
and
the
unpopular
and
costly
war
contributed
to
their
subsequent
downfall
.


Convoy
Faith
was
a
small
,
fast
Allied
convoy
of
World
War
II
.


It
suffered
heavy
casualties
when
attacked
by
German
Focke-Wulf
Fw
200
Condor
long-range
bombers
while
en
route
from
Britain
to
West
Africa
in
July
1943
.


The
convoy
comprised
two
large
troopships
and
a
freighter
,
later
joined
by
two
destroyers
and
two
frigates
as
escorts
at
various
dates
after
it
sailed
on
7
July
1943
.


The
two
troopships
,
SS
``
California
''
and
SS
``
Duchess
of
York
''
,
both
former
liners
,
were
carrying
military
personnel
to
West
Africa
,
where
locally
recruited
troops
were
to
be
embarked
as
reinforcements
for
the
Allied
forces
in
Burma
and
the
Middle
East
.


The
freighter
MV
``
Port
Fairy
''
,
carrying
ammunition
,
was
ultimately
bound
for
Australia
and
New
Zealand
via
the
Panama
canal
.


On
the
evening
of
11
July
,
four
days
after
sailing
,
Convoy
Faith
was
attacked
by
three
Condors
.


Both
troopships
were
severely
damaged
and
subsequently
sunk
by
torpedoes
from
the
escorts
;
over
100
of
the
personnel
aboard
the
two
ships
were
killed
.


The
freighter
escaped
unscathed
,
but
was
damaged
in
a
second
air
attack
on
12
July
en
route
to
Casablanca
.


The
loss
of
the
two
troopships
delayed
the
movement
of
a
division
of
West
African
soldiers
to
India
until
four
replacements
arrived
.


The
British
military
was
surprised
by
the
attack
on
Convoy
Faith
,
as
it
had
been
believed
that
the
Condors
no
longer
posed
a
serious
threat
.


In
response
,
the
convoy
route
between
Britain
and
Africa
was
moved
to
the
west
.


The
German
Condor
force
attempted
to
repeat
its
success
against
Convoy
Faith
by
carrying
out
similar
attacks
on
other
convoys
,
but
sustained
heavy
losses
from
Allied
anti-aircraft
guns
and
aircraft
.


Operation
Tungsten
was
a
Second
World
War
Royal
Navy
air
raid
that
targeted
the
German
battleship
``
Tirpitz
''
.


The
operation
sought
to
damage
or
destroy
``
Tirpitz
''
at
her
base
in
Kaafjord
in
the
far
north
of
Norway
before
she
could
become
fully
operational
again
following
a
period
of
repairs
.


The
British
decision
to
strike
Kaafjord
was
motivated
by
fears
that
the
battleship
,
upon
re-entering
service
,
would
attack
strategically
important
convoys
carrying
supplies
to
the
Soviet
Union
.


Removing
the
threat
posed
by
``
Tirpitz
''
would
also
allow
the
Allies
to
redeploy
the
capital
ships
which
had
to
be
held
in
the
North
Sea
to
counter
her
.


After
four
months
of
training
and
preparations
,
the
British
Home
Fleet
sailed
on
30
March
1944
and
aircraft
launched
from
five
aircraft
carriers
struck
Kaafjord
on
3
April
.


The
raid
achieved
surprise
,
and
the
British
aircraft
met
little
opposition
.


Fifteen
bombs
hit
the
battleship
,
and
strafing
by
fighter
aircraft
inflicted
heavy
casualties
on
her
gun
crews
.


Four
British
aircraft
and
nine
airmen
were
lost
during
the
operation
.


The
damage
inflicted
during
the
attack
was
not
sufficient
to
sink
or
disable
``
Tirpitz
''
,
but
she
suffered
considerable
damage
to
her
superstructure
and
unarmored
areas
,
with
122
members
of
her
crew
killed
and
316
were
wounded
.


The
German
``
Kriegsmarine
''
decided
to
repair
the
battleship
,
and
works
were
completed
by
mid-July
.


The
British
conducted
further
carrier
raids
against
``
Tirpitz
''
between
April
and
August
1944
in
the
hope
of
prolonging
the
period
she
was
out
of
service
,
but
none
was
successful
.


``
tirpitz
''
was
eventually
disabled
and
then
sunk
by
royal
air
force
heavy
bombers
in
late
1944
.


The
Gleiwitz
incident
(
;
)
was
a
covert
Nazi
German
attack
on
the
German
radio
station
``
Sender
Gleiwitz
''
on
the
night
of
31
August
1939
(
today
Gliwice
,
Poland
)
.


The
attack
was
a
false
flag
operation
,
staged
with
some
two
dozen
similar
German
incidents
on
the
eve
of
the
invasion
of
Poland
leading
up
to
World
War
II
in
Europe
.


The
attackers
posed
as
Polish
nationals
.


Adolf
Hitler
’
s
armed
forces
invaded
Poland
the
next
morning
after
a
lengthy
period
of
preparations
.


During
his
declaration
of
war
,
Hitler
did
not
mention
the
Gleiwitz
incident
but
grouped
all
provocations
staged
by
the
SS
as
an
alleged
Polish
assault
on
Germany
.


The
Gleiwitz
incident
is
the
best-known
action
of
Operation
Himmler
,
a
series
of
special
operations
undertaken
by
the
``
Schutzstaffel
''
(
SS
)
to
serve
Nazi
German
propaganda
at
the
outbreak
of
war
.


The
operation
was
intended
to
create
the
appearance
of
Polish
aggression
against
Germany
to
justify
the
invasion
of
Poland
.


Evidence
for
the
Gleiwitz
attack
by
the
SS
was
provided
by
the
German
SS
officer
,
Alfred
Naujocks
in
1945
.


The
Naval
Battle
of
Guadalcanal
,
sometimes
referred
to
as
the
Third
and
Fourth
Battles
of
Savo
Island
,
the
Battle
of
the
Solomons
,
the
Battle
of
Friday
the
13th
,
or
,
in
Japanese
sources
,
the
,
took
place
from
12–15
November
1942
,
and
was
the
decisive
engagement
in
a
series
of
naval
battles
between
Allied
(
primarily
American
)
and
Imperial
Japanese
forces
during
the
months-long
Guadalcanal
Campaign
in
the
Solomon
Islands
during
World
War
II
.


The
action
consisted
of
combined
air
and
sea
engagements
over
four
days
,
most
near
Guadalcanal
and
all
related
to
a
Japanese
effort
to
reinforce
land
forces
on
the
island
.


The
only
two
U.S.
Navy
admirals
to
be
killed
in
a
surface
engagement
in
the
war
were
lost
in
this
battle
.


Allied
forces
landed
on
Guadalcanal
on
7
August
1942
and
seized
an
airfield
,
later
called
Henderson
Field
,
that
was
under
construction
by
the
Japanese
military
.


There
were
several
subsequent
attempts
to
recapture
the
airfield
by
the
Imperial
Japanese
Army
and
Navy
using
reinforcements
delivered
to
Guadalcanal
by
ship
,
efforts
which
ultimately
failed
.


In
early
November
1942
,
the
Japanese
organized
a
transport
convoy
to
take
7,000
infantry
troops
and
their
equipment
to
Guadalcanal
to
attempt
once
again
to
retake
the
airfield
.


Several
Japanese
warship
forces
were
assigned
to
bombard
Henderson
Field
with
the
goal
of
destroying
Allied
aircraft
that
posed
a
threat
to
the
convoy
.


Learning
of
the
Japanese
reinforcement
effort
,
U.S.
forces
launched
aircraft
and
warship
attacks
to
defend
Henderson
Field
and
prevent
the
Japanese
ground
troops
from
reaching
Guadalcanal
.


In
the
resulting
battle
,
both
sides
lost
numerous
warships
in
two
extremely
destructive
surface
engagements
at
night
.


Nevertheless
,
the
U.S.
succeeded
in
turning
back
attempts
by
the
Japanese
to
bombard
Henderson
Field
with
battleships
.


Allied
aircraft
also
sank
most
of
the
Japanese
troop
transports
and
prevented
the
majority
of
the
Japanese
troops
and
equipment
from
reaching
Guadalcanal
.


Thus
,
the
battle
turned
back
Japan
's
last
major
attempt
to
dislodge
Allied
forces
from
Guadalcanal
and
nearby
Tulagi
,
resulting
in
a
strategic
victory
for
the
U.S.
and
its
allies
and
deciding
the
ultimate
outcome
of
the
Guadalcanal
campaign
in
their
favor
.


Operation
Pedestal
(
,
``
Battle
of
mid-August
''
)
,
known
in
Malta
as
the
Santa
Marija
Convoy
(
)
,
was
a
British
operation
to
carry
supplies
to
the
island
of
Malta
in
August
1942
,
during
the
Second
World
War
.


Malta
was
a
base
from
which
British
ships
,
submarines
and
aircraft
attacked
Axis
convoys
to
their
forces
in
Libya
and
Egypt
,
during
the
North
African
Campaign
(
1940–1943
)
.


From
1940
to
1942
,
the
Axis
conducted
the
Siege
of
Malta
,
with
air
and
naval
forces
.


Despite
many
losses
,
enough
supplies
were
delivered
by
the
British
for
the
population
and
military
forces
on
Malta
to
resist
,
although
it
ceased
to
be
an
offensive
base
for
much
of
1942
.


The
most
crucial
supply
item
in
Operation
Pedestal
was
fuel
,
carried
by
,
an
American
tanker
with
a
British
crew
.


The
convoy
sailed
from
Britain
on
3
August
1942
and
passed
through
the
Strait
of
Gibraltar
into
the
Mediterranean
on
the
night
of
The
Axis
attempt
to
prevent
the
fifty
ships
of
the
convoy
reaching
Malta
,
using
bombers
,
German
E-boats
,
Italian
MAS
and
MS
boats
,
minefields
and
submarine
ambushes
,
was
the
last
sizeable
Axis
success
in
the
Mediterranean
.


More
than
and
Royal
Navy
sailors
and
airmen
were
killed
and
only
five
of
the
ships
reached
Grand
Harbour
.


While
costly
for
the
Allies
,
it
was
a
strategic
victory
;
the
arrival
of
``
Ohio
''
justified
the
decision
to
hazard
so
many
warships
;
its
cargo
of
aviation
fuel
revitalised
the
Maltese
air
offensive
against
Axis
shipping
.


Submarines
returned
to
Malta
and
Supermarine
Spitfires
flown
from
the
aircraft
carrier
enabled
a
maximum
effort
to
be
made
against
Axis
ships
.


Italian
convoys
had
to
detour
further
away
from
the
island
,
lengthening
the
journey
and
increasing
the
time
during
which
air
and
naval
attacks
could
be
mounted
.


The
Siege
of
Malta
was
broken
by
the
Allied
re-conquest
of
Egypt
and
Libya
after
the
Second
Battle
of
El
Alamein
(
23
October
–
11
November
)
and
by
Operation
Torch
(
8–16
November
)
in
the
western
Mediterranean
,
which
enabled
land-based
aircraft
to
escort
merchant
ships
to
the
island
.


This
is
the
5th
world
tour
of
the
Irish
pop
band
Westlife
seen
by
395,000
fans
.


This
tour
set
a
goal
that
they
will
play
in
smaller
venues
and
for
smaller
audiences
to
justify
the
title
``
Face
to
Face
''
.


The
filmed
video
album
for
this
tour
came
from
their
performance
at
the
Wembley

.


This
also
had
a
second
leg
of
the
tour
'summer
nights
'
all
over
the
biggest
UK
outdoor
parks
,
castles
and
racing
grounds
.

The

also
meant
to

Australia
but
this
was
postponed
until
the
next

.


This
was
due
to
recording
commitments
.


This
concert
tour
was
marked
as
the
first
time
Steve
Anderson
and
William
Baker
had
worked
together
outside

camp
.


The
O.K
.


Corral
hearing
and
aftermath
was
the
direct
result
of
the
30-second
Gunfight
at
the
O.K
.


Corral
in
Tombstone
,
Arizona
Territory
on
October
26
,
1881
.


During
that
confrontation
,
Deputy
U.S
.


Marshal
and
Tombstone
Town
Marshal
Virgil
Earp
,
Assistant
Town
Marshal
Morgan
Earp
,
and
temporary
deputy
marshals
Wyatt
Earp
and
Doc
Holliday
shot
and
killed
Billy
Clanton
,
and
Tom
and
Frank
McLaury
.


Billy
's
brother
Ike
,
who
had
repeatedly
threatened
to
kill
the
Earps
for
some
time
,
had
been
present
at
the
gunfight
but
was
unarmed
and
fled
.


He
filed
murder
charges
against
the
Earps
and
Doc
Holliday
on
October
30
.


In
an
unusual
preliminary
hearing
,
Justice
of
the
Peace
Wells
Spicer
heard
testimony
from
a
large
number
of
witnesses
during
the
next
30
days
.


Friends
of
the
Cowboys
,
most
notably
Cochise
County
Sheriff
Johnny
Behan
,
testified
that
the
Cowboys
had
thrown
up
their
hands
or
opened
their
coats
and
been
shot
in
cold
blood
.


Initially
persuasive
,
his
testimony
motivated
Spicer
to
jail
Wyatt
Earp
and
Doc
Holliday
who
had
been
free
on
bond
.


(
Virgil
and
Morgan
were
recuperating
from
their
wounds
.
)


friends
of
the
lawman
and
several
key
neutral
witnesses
then
testified
that
the
cowboys
had
drawn
their
guns
and
that
virgil
earp
had
called
out
,
``
hold
,
i
do
n't
want
that
!
''


or
words
to
that
effect
.


In
a
lengthy
ruling
,
Spicer
concluded
there
was
no
basis
for
a
trial
.


although
he
criticized
virgil
earp
's
use
of
wyatt
and
holliday
as
deputies
,
he
concluded
that
no
laws
were
broken
by
the
lawmen
.


He
said
the
evidence
indicated
that
the
Earps
and
Holliday
acted
within
the
law
and
that
Holliday
and
Wyatt
had
been
properly
deputized
by
Virgil
.


He
described
Frank
McLaury
's
insistence
that
he
would
not
give
up
his
weapons
unless
the
marshal
and
his
deputies
also
gave
up
their
arms
as
a
``
proposition
both
monstrous
and
startling
!
''


The
Earps
were
freed
from
jail
,
but
the
blood
feud
between
the
lawmen
and
their
friends
and
the
Cowboys
and
their
allies
escalated
.


On
December
14
,
Justice
Spicer
received
a
threatening
letter
from
``
a
miner
''
who
threatened
to
kill
him
and
told
him
to
leave
Tombstone
.


On
the
same
day
,
someone
tried
to
kill
Tombstone
Mayor
John
Clum
,
who
was
a
member
of
the
Citizens
Safety
Committee
and
publisher
of
``
The
Tombstone
Epitaph
''
that
had
consistently
supported
the
Earps
.


On
December
28
,
1881
,
Virgil
Earp
was
ambushed
and
hit
by
a
shotgun
round
that
crippled
his
left
arm
.


The
Earps
thought
they
knew
who
the
perpetrators
were
,
but
witnesses
provided
alibis
for
them
.


On
March
18
,
Morgan
was
killed
while
playing
billiards
.


An
assassin
shot
him
through
the
window
of
a
door
that
opened
up
into
an
alley
.


A
bullet
intended
for
Wyatt
struck
close
above
his
head
.


Once
again
,
the
Earps
believed
they
knew
the
men
responsible
,
but
the
testimony
of
a
key
witness
was
inadmissible
and
the
Cowboys
were
not
charged
.


Wyatt
assumed
Virgil
's
duties
as
Deputy
U.S
.


Marshal
for
eastern
Pima
County
.


He
concluded
that
he
could
not
rely
on
the
courts
for
justice
and
decided
to
take
matters
into
his
own
hands
.


He
decided
that
the
only
way
to
deal
with
the
Earp
's
enemies
was
to
kill
them
.


He
assembled
a
federal
posse
that
intercepted
Frank
Stilwell
laying
in
wait
near
the
train
station
in
Tucson
and
killed
him
.


They
then
scoured
the
countryside
looking
for
the
others
they
believed
responsible
.


During
early
April
,
1882
,
Wyatt
and
his
posse
tracked
down
and
killed
Florentino
``
Indian
Charlie
''
Cruz
,
Curly
Bill
Brocius
,
and
Johnny
Barnes
,
three
of
the
men
they
believed
were
responsible
for
their
brothers
'
ambush
and
murder
.


The
ride
for
vengeance
came
to
be
called
the
Earp
Vendetta
Ride
.


Five
of
the
Earp
party
were
wanted
on
a
warrant
for
killing
Frank
Stilwell
,
and
they
left
Arizona
Territory
and
never
returned
.


Strategic
bombing
during
World
War
II
was
the
sustained
aerial
attack
on
railways
,
harbours
,
cities
,
workers
'
and
civilian
housing
,
and
industrial
districts
in
enemy
territory
during
World
War
II
.


Strategic
bombing
is
a
military
strategy
which
is
distinct
from
both
close
air
support
of
ground
forces
and
tactical
air
power
.


During
World
War
II
,
it
was
believed
by
many
military
strategists
of
air
power
that
major
victories
could
be
won
by
attacking
industrial
and
political
infrastructure
,
rather
than
purely
military
targets
.


Strategic
bombing
often
involved
bombing
areas
inhabited
by
civilians
and
some
campaigns
were
deliberately
designed
to
target
civilian
populations
in
order
to
terrorize
and
disrupt
their
usual
activities
.


International
law
at
the
outset
of
World
War
II
did
not
specifically
forbid
aerial
bombardment
of
cities
despite
the
prior
occurrence
of
such
bombing
during
World
War
I
,
the
Spanish
Civil
War
,
and
the
Second
Sino-Japanese
War
.


strategic
bombing
during
world
war
ii
began
on
1
september
1939
when
germany
invaded
poland
and
the
``
luftwaffe
''
(
german
air
force
)
began
bombing
cities
and
the
civilian
population
in
poland
in
an
indiscriminate
aerial
bombardment
campaign
.


As
the
war
continued
to
expand
,
bombing
by
both
the
Axis
and
the
Allies
increased
significantly
.


the
royal
air
force
began
bombing
military
targets
in
germany
,
such
as
docks
and
shipyards
,
in
march
1940
.


In
September
1940
,
the
Luftwaffe
began
targeting
British
cities
in
the
Blitz
.


After
the
beginning
of
Operation
Barbarossa
in
June
1941
,
the
Luftwaffe
attacked
Soviet
cities
and
infrastructure
.


From
1942
onward
,
the
British
bombing
campaign
against
Germany
became
less
restrictive
and
increasingly
targeted
industrial
sites
and
eventually
,
civilian
areas
.


When
the
United
States
began
flying
bombing
missions
against
Germany
,
it
reinforced
these
efforts
and
controversial
firebombings
were
carried
out
against
Hamburg
(
1943
)
,
Dresden
(
1945
)
,
and
other
German
cities
.


In
the
Pacific
War
,
the
Japanese
bombed
civilian
populations
throughout
the
war
(
e.g
.


in
Chongqing
)
.


The
US
air
raids
on
Japan
began
in
earnest
in
October
1944
and
by
March
1945
had
started
their
escalation
into
widespread
firebombing
,
which
culminated
in
the
atomic
bombings
of
Hiroshima
and
Nagasaki
on
6
and
9
August
1945
,
respectively
.


The
effect
of
strategic
bombing
was
highly
debated
during
and
after
the
war
.


Both
the
``
Luftwaffe
''
and
RAF
failed
to
deliver
a
knockout
blow
by
destroying
enemy
morale
.


However
some
argued
that
strategic
bombing
of
non-military
targets
could
significantly
reduce
enemy
industrial
capacity
and
production
and
in
the
opinion
of
its
interwar
period
proponents
,
the
surrender
of
Japan
vindicated
strategic
bombing
.


The
Whack
Attack
Tour
was
a
concert
tour
by
rock

.


Whack
Attack
was
a
24-week-long
tour
in
the
United

and
Canada
,
which
was
a
longer
outing
than
the
previous
Summer

.


It
began
in
June
2005
and
ended
in
November
2005
.


The

was
designed
by
Chris
Stuba
and
had
a
'retro

'
theme
,
with
custom
microphone

The

has
received
positive
criticism
,
complimenting

showmanship
,
as
well
as
the
longevity
of
their
signature
sound
and

Serena
Hotel
,
in
Kabul
,
Afghanistan
on
January
14
,

The
Tangled
Up
Tour
was
the
fourth
concert
tour
by
English-Irish
girl
group
Girls
Aloud
.


It
supported
their
fourth
studio
album
``
Tangled
Up
''
.


Tour
dates
were
announced
in
November
2007
.


Girls
Aloud
performed
twenty-four
shows
at
arenas
across
the
United
Kingdom
and
Ireland
,
making
this
tour
their
third
to
reach
arenas
.


The
tour
commenced
in
Belfast
on
3
May
2008
and
concluded
in
Birmingham
on
4
June
.


Girls
Aloud
also
performed
eleven
open-air
concerts
over
the
summer
.


The
show
was
divided
into
five
unique
sections
with
distinct
costumes
,
including
the
encore
.


The
stage
outfits
,
designed
by
Welsh
designer
Julien
MacDonald
,
received
comparisons
to
Madonna

,
as
well
as
earlier
singles
and
album
tracks
.


A
ballad
section
took
place
on
a
smaller

of
the
arena
.


Billiam
,
Luigi
Masi
,
and
The
Saturdays
provided
support
for
Girls

.


The
tour
generated
positive
reviews
from
critics
,
who
noted
the
performance
as
being
the
most
sexual
of
Girls
Aloud
's
career
to
date
.

The
1918
Spring
Offensive
,
or
Kaiserschlacht
(
``
Kaiser
's
Battle
''
)
,
also
known
as
the
Ludendorff
Offensive
,
was
a
series
of
German
attacks
along
the
Western
Front
during
the
First
World
War
,
beginning
on
21
March
1918
,
which
marked
the
deepest
advances
by
either
side
since
1914
.


The
Germans
had
realised
that
their
only
remaining
chance
of
victory
was
to
defeat
the
Allies
before
the
overwhelming
human
and
matériel
resources
of
the
United
States
could
be
fully
deployed
.


they
also
had
the
temporary
advantage
in
numbers
afforded
by
the
nearly
50
divisions
which
had
been
freed
by
the
russian
withdrawal
from
the
war
by
the
treaty
of
brest-litovsk
.


There
were
four
German
offensives
,
codenamed
``
Michael
''
,
``
Georgette
''
,
``
Gneisenau
''
,
and
``
Blücher-Yorck
''
.


``
Michael
''
was
the
main
attack
,
which
was
intended
to
break
through
the
Allied
lines
,
outflank
the
British
forces
(
which
held
the
front
from
the
Somme
River
to
the
English
Channel
)
and
defeat
the
British
Army
.


Once
that
was
achieved
,
it
was
hoped
that
the
French
would
seek
armistice
terms
.


The
other
offensives
were
subsidiary
to
``
Michael
''
and
were
designed
to
divert
Allied
forces
from
the
main
offensive
effort
on
the
Somme
.


No
clear
objective
was
established
before
the
start
of
the
offensives
and
once
the
operations
were
underway
,
the
targets
of
the
attacks
were
constantly
changed
according
to
the
battlefield
(
tactical
)
situation
.


The
Allies
concentrated
their
main
forces
in
the
essential
areas
(
the
approaches
to
the
Channel
Ports
and
the
rail
junction
of
Amiens
)
,
leaving
strategically
worthless
ground
,
which
had
been
devastated
by
years
of
conflict
,
lightly
defended
.


The
Germans
were
unable
to
move
supplies
and
reinforcements
fast
enough
to
maintain
their
advance
.


The
fast-moving
stormtroopers
leading
the
attack
could
not
carry
enough
food
and
ammunition
to
sustain
themselves
for
long
,
and
all
the
German
offensives
petered
out
,
partly
for
lack
of
supplies
.


By
late
April
1918
,
the
danger
of
a
German
breakthrough
had
passed
.


The
German
Army
had
suffered
heavy
casualties
and
now
occupied
ground
of
dubious
value
,
which
would
prove
impossible
to
hold
with
such
depleted
units
.


In
August
1918
,
the
Allies
began
a
counteroffensive
with
the
support
of
1–2
million
fresh
American
troops
and
using
improved
artillery
techniques
and
operational
methods
.


This
Hundred
Days
Offensive
resulted
in

The
Femme
Fatale
Tour
was
the
eighth
concert
tour
by
American
recording
artist
Britney
Spears
.


It
was
launched
in
support
of
her
seventh
studio
album
``
Femme
Fatale
''
(
2011
)
.


It
was
officially
announced
in
March
2011
,
with
dates
for
North
American
venues
revealed
.


The
tour
was
initially
planned
as
a
co-headlining
tour
with
Enrique
Iglesias
,
but
he
canceled
only
hours
after
the
announcement
.


The
show
is
inspired
by
the
concept
of
the
femme
fatale
and
femmes
fatales
throughout
the
ages
.


The
setlist
was
mostly
composed
of
songs
from
``
Femme
Fatale
''
,
although
Spears
also
performed
hits
from
her
previous
albums
for
her
fans
.


Fashion
designer
Zaldy
Goco
created
the
costumes
.


In
July
2011
,
Spears
announced
plans
of
playing
a
South
American
leg
in
territories
she
either
had
never
been
to
or
had
not
played
for
a
long
time
.


Spears
has
named
the
Femme
Fatale
Tour
the
best
show
of
her
career
.


The
tour
,
divided
in
five
segments
,
portrays
a
story
in
which
Spears
is
a
secret
agent
,
who
is
chased
by
a
stalker
named
Tormento
Lancie
;
played
by
Rudolf
Martin
.


The
first
section
features
her
escaping
from
prison
along
with
other
female
inmates
.


The
second
segment
displays
upbeat
dance
numbers
and
ends
with
a
performance
inspired
by
Marilyn
Monroe
.


The
third
section
features
an
Egyptian
theme
with
fireworks
and
acrobatics
.


The
fourth
segment
displays
energetic
routines
and
motorcycle
costumes
.


The
encore
begins
with
a
video
interlude
of
Spears
capturing
the
stalker
,
and
is
followed
by
two
performances
in
which
she
defeats
a
group
of
ninjas
.


The
Femme
Fatale
Tour
received
mixed
to
positive
reviews
from
critics
.


Some
described
it
as
Spears
'
most
entertaining
show
and
praised
her
performance
,
while
others
criticized
her
dancing
and
lack
of
audience
interaction
.


The
Femme
Fatale
Tour
grossed
$
6.2
million
in
the
first
ten
shows
,
and
was
included
on
Pollstar
's

was
leaked
onto
YouTube
in
July
2011

The
``
Johnson
Sea
Link
''
accident
was
a
June
1973
incident
that
claimed
the
lives
of
two
divers
.


During
a
seemingly
routine
dive
off
Key
West
,
the
submersible
``
Johnson
Sea
Link
''
was
trapped
for
over
24
hours
in
the
wreckage
of
the
destroyer
,
which
had
been
sunk
to
create
an
artificial
reef
.


although
the
submersible
was
eventually
recovered
by
the
rescue
vessel

,
two
of
the
four
occupants
died
of
carbon
dioxide
poisoning
:
31-year-old
Edwin
Clayton
Link
(
son
of
Edwin
Albert
Link
,
the
submersible
's
designer
)
and
51-year-old
diver
Albert
Dennison
Stover
.


The
submersible
's
pilot
,
Archibald
``
Jock
''
Menzies
,
and
ichthyologist
Robert
Meek
survived
.


over
the
next

Trinity
was
the
code
name
of
the
first
detonation
of
a
nuclear
device
.


It
was
conducted
by
the
United
States
Army
at
5:29
a.m.
on
July
16
,
1945
,
as
part
of
the
Manhattan
Project
.


The
test
was
conducted
in
the
Jornada
del
Muerto
desert
about
southeast
of
Socorro
,
New
Mexico
,
on
what
was
then
the
USAAF
Alamogordo
Bombing
and
Gunnery
Range
,
now
part
of
White
Sands
Missile
Range
.


the
only
structures
originally
in
the
vicinity
were
the
mcdonald
ranch
house
and
its
ancillary
buildings
,
which
scientists
used
as
a
laboratory
for
testing
bomb
components
.


A
base
camp
was
constructed
,
and
there
were
425
people
present
on
the
weekend
of
the
test
.


The
code
name
``
Trinity
''
was
assigned
by
J.
Robert
Oppenheimer
,
the
director
of
the
Los
Alamos
Laboratory
,
inspired
by
the
poetry
of
John
Donne
.


The
test
was
of
an
implosion-design
plutonium
device
,
informally
nicknamed
``
The
Gadget
''
,
of
the
same
design
as
the
Fat
Man
bomb
later
detonated
over
Nagasaki
,
Japan
,
on
August
9
,
1945
.


The
complexity
of
the
design
required
a
major
effort
from
the
Los
Alamos
Laboratory
,
and
concerns
about
whether
it
would
work
led
to
a
decision
to
conduct
the
first
nuclear
test
.


The
test
was
planned
and
directed
by
Kenneth
Bainbridge
.


Fears
of
a
fizzle
led
to
the
construction
of
a
steel
containment
vessel
called
Jumbo
that
could
contain
the
plutonium
,
allowing
it
to
be
recovered
,
but
Jumbo
was
not
used
.


A
rehearsal
was
held
on
May
7
,
1945
,
in
which
of
high
explosive
spiked
with
radioactive
isotopes
were
detonated
.


The
Gadget
's
detonation
released
the
explosive
energy
of
about
.


Observers
included
Vannevar
Bush
,
James
Chadwick
,
James
Conant
,
Thomas
Farrell
,
Enrico
Fermi
,
Richard
Feynman
,
Leslie
Groves
,
Robert
Oppenheimer
,
Geoffrey
Taylor
,
Richard
Tolman
and
John
von
Neumann
.


The
test
site
was
declared
a
National
Historic
Landmark
district
in
1965
,
and
listed
on
the
National
Register
of
Historic
Places
the
following
year
.


Omaha
,
commonly
known
as
Omaha
Beach
,
was
the
code
name
for
one
of
the
five
sectors
of
the
Allied
invasion
of
German-occupied
France
in
the
Normandy
landings
on
June
6
,
1944
,
during
World
War
II
.


``
Omaha
''
refers
to
a
section
of
the
coast
of
Normandy
,
France
,
facing
the
English
Channel
long
,
from
east
of
Sainte-Honorine-des-Pertes
to
west
of
Vierville-sur-Mer
on
the
right
bank
of
the
Douve
River
estuary
and
an
estimated
tall
cliffs
.


Landings
here
were
necessary
to
link
the
British
landings
to
the
east
at
Gold
with
the
American
landing
to
the
west
at
Utah
,
thus
providing
a
continuous
lodgement
on
the
Normandy
coast
of
the
Bay
of
the
Seine
.


taking
omaha
was
to
be
the
responsibility
of
united
states
army
troops
,
with
sea
transport
,
mine
sweeping
,
and
a
naval
bombardment
force
provided
predominantly
by
the
united
states
navy
and
coast
guard
,
with
contributions
from
the
british
,
canadian
,
and
free
french
navies
.


The
primary
objective
at
Omaha
was
to
secure
a
beachhead
of
depth
,
between
Port-en-Bessin
and
the
Vire
River
,
linking
with
the
British
landings
at
Gold
to
the
east
,
and
reaching
the
area
of
Isigny
to
the
west
to
link
up
with
VII
Corps
landing
at
Utah
.


Opposing
the
landings
was
the
German
352nd
Infantry
Division
.


Of
the
12,020
men
of
the
division
,
6,800
were
experienced
combat
troops
,
detailed
to
defend
a
front
.


The
German
strategy
was
based
on
defeating
any
seaborne
assault
at
the
water
line
,
and
the
defenses
were
mainly
deployed
in
strongpoints
along
the
coast
.


The
untested
American
29th
Infantry
Division
,
along
with
nine
companies
of
U.S.
Army
Rangers
redirected
from
Pointe
du
Hoc
,
assaulted
the
western
half
of
the
beach
.


The
battle-hardened
1st
Infantry
Division
was
given
the
eastern
half
.


The
initial
assault
waves
,
consisting
of
tanks
,
infantry
,
and
combat
engineer
forces
,
were
carefully
planned
to
reduce
the
coastal
defenses
and
allow
the
larger
ships
of
the
follow-up
waves
to
land
.


Very
little
went
as
planned
during
the
landing
at
Omaha
.


Difficulties
in
navigation
caused
the
majority
of
landing
craft
to
miss
their
targets
throughout
the
day
.


The
defenses
were
unexpectedly
strong
,
and
inflicted
heavy
casualties
on
landing
U.S.
troops
.


Under
heavy
fire
,
the
engineers
struggled
to
clear
the
beach
obstacles
;
later
landings
bunched
up
around
the
few
channels
that
were
cleared
.


Weakened
by
the
casualties
taken
just
in
landing
,
the
surviving
assault
troops
could
not
clear
the
heavily
defended
exits
off
the
beach
.


This
caused
further
problems
and
consequent
delays
for
later
landings
.


Small
penetrations
were
eventually
achieved
by
groups
of
survivors
making
improvised
assaults
,
scaling
the
bluffs
between
the
most
heavily
defended
points
.


By
the
end
of
the
day
,
two
small
isolated
footholds
had
been
won
,
which
were
subsequently
exploited
against
weaker
defenses
further
inland
,
thus
achieving
the
original
D-Day
objectives
over
the
following
days
.


The
Aramoana
massacre
was
a
spree
shooting
that
occurred
on
13
November
1990
in
the
small
seaside
township
of
Aramoana
,
northeast
of
Dunedin
,
New
Zealand
.


Resident
David
Gray
killed
13
people
after
a
verbal
dispute
with
his
next-door
neighbour
,
including
local
police
Sergeant
Stewart
Guthrie
,
one
of
the
first
responders
to
the
reports
of
a
shooting
.


After
a
careful
house-to-house
search
the
next
day
,
police
officers
led
by
the
Anti-Terrorist
Squad
(
now
known
as
the
Special
Tactics
Group
)
located
Gray
,
and
shot
and
injured
him
as
he
came
out
of
a
house
firing
from
the
hip
.


He
died
in
an
ambulance
while
being
transported
to
hospital
.


Television
news
carried
live
reports
from
the
scene
.


After
the
shootings
,
sweeping
changes
were
made
to
New
Zealand
's
firearms
legislation
in
1992
,
including
10
year
photographic
licences
and
tight
restrictions
on
military
style
semi-automatic
firearms
.


The
Battle
of
Halmyros
,
known
by
earlier
scholars
as
the
Battle
of
the
Cephissus
or
Battle
of
Orchomenos
,
was
fought
on
15
March
1311
,
between
the
forces
of
the
Frankish
Duchy
of
Athens
and
its
vassals
under
Walter
of
Brienne
against
the
mercenaries
of
the
Catalan
Company
,
resulting
in
a
decisive
victory
for
the
Catalans
.


Engaged
in
conflict
with
their
original
employers
,
the
Byzantine
Empire
,
the
Catalan
Company
had
traversed
the
southern
Balkans
and
arrived
in
southern
Greece
in
1309
.


The
new
Duke
of
Athens
,
Walter
of
Brienne
,
hired
them
to
attack
the
Greek
ruler
of
neighbouring
Thessaly
.


although
the
catalans
conquered
much
of
the
region
for
him
,
walter
refused
to
pay
them
and
prepared
to
forcibly
expel
them
from
their
gains
.


The
two
armies
met
at
Halmyros
in
southern
Thessaly
(
or
at
the
Boeotic
Cephissus
,
near
Orchomenos
,
according
to
an
earlier
interpretation
)
.


The
Catalans
were
considerably
outnumbered
and
weakened
by
the
reluctance
of
their
Turkish
auxiliaries
to
fight
.


The
Company
did
have
the
advantage
of
selecting
the
battleground
,
positioning
themselves
behind
marshy
terrain
,
which
they
further
inundated
.


On
the
Athenian
side
,
many
of
the
most
important
lords
of
Frankish
Greece
were
present
and
Walter
,
a
prideful
man
and
confident
in
the
prowess
of
his
heavy
cavalry
,
proceeded
to
charge
headlong
against
the
Catalan
line
.


The
marsh
impeded
the
Frankish
attack
and
the
Catalan
infantry
stood
firm
.


The
Turks
re-joined
the
Company
and
the
Frankish
army
was
routed
;
Walter
and
almost
the
entire
knighthood
of
his
realm
fell
in
the
field
.


As
a
result
of
the
battle
,
the
Catalans
took
over
the
leaderless
Duchy
of
Athens
;
they
ruled
that
part
of
Greece
until
the
1380s
.


The
1919
Florida
Keys
hurricane
(
also
known
as
the
1919
Key
West
hurricane
)
was
a
massive
and
damaging
tropical
cyclone
that
swept
across
areas
of
the
northern
Caribbean
Sea
and
the
United
States
Gulf
Coast
in
September
1919
.


Remaining
an
intense
Atlantic
hurricane
throughout
much
of
its
existence
,
the
storm
's
slow-movement
and
sheer
size
prolonged
and
enlarged
the
scope
of
the
hurricane
's
effects
,
making
it
one
of
the
deadliest
hurricanes
in
United
States
history
.


Impacts
were
largely
concentrated
around
the
Florida
Keys
and
South
Texas
areas
,
though
lesser
but
nonetheless
significant
effects
were
felt
in
Cuba
and
other
areas
of
the
United
States
Gulf
Coast
.


The
hurricane
developed
near
the
Leeward
Islands
as
a
tropical
depression
on
September
2
and
gradually
gained
in
strength
as
it
tracked
on
a
generally
west-northwesterly
path
,
crossing
the
Mona
Passage
and
moving
across
the
Bahamas
.


On
September
7
,
the
storm
reached
hurricane
intensity
over
the
eastern
Bahamas
.


On
September
9–10
,
the
storm
made
its
eponymous
pass
of
the
Florida
Keys
,
passing
over
the
Dry
Tortugas
with
an
intensity
equivalent
to
that
of
a
modern-day
Category
4
hurricane
.


over
the
next
several
days
,
the
intense
cyclone
traversed
the
gulf
of
mexico
,
fluctuating
in
strength
before
making
landfall
near
texas
'
baffin
bay
on
september
14
as
a
large
category
3
hurricane
.


As
it
tracked
further
inland
,
land
interaction
caused
the
storm
to
gradually
weaken
;
the
storm
was
last
noted
on
September
16
over
West
Texas
.


Here
&
Now
Tour
was
a
concerts
tour
by
American
singer
Diana
Ross
from
1991
to
1992
.


It
was
a
world
tour
that
began
in
Asia
where
her
album
,
``
The
Force
Behind
the
Power
''
had
gone
gold
.


The
tour
was
recorded
live
for
a
television
special
in
Japan
.


The
tour
hit
the
English-speaking
world
in
Australia
with
the
second
live
recorded
special
from
Perth
.


She
landed
in
America
,
determined
to
play
smaller
markets
like
Syracuse
and
Poughkeepsie
before
sweeping
across
America
.


The
summer
dates
were
across
Europe
beginning
in
a
continued
6
sold
out
Wembley/London
across
the
continent
as
the
3rd
single
,
``
One
Shining
Moment
''
was
hitting
the
Top
10
.


The
Palais
de
Sportes
in
Paris
was
a
highlight
for
two
nights
.


the
album
continued
to
do
well
for
the
holidays
when
her
huge
japanese
hit
``
if
we
hold
on
together
''
became
a
european
smash
supported
by
the
airing
of
``
christmas
in
vienna
''
with
placido
domingo
and
jose
carreras
.


Television
exposure
had
been
key
throughout
this
tour
.


Earlier
in
the
spring
,
Diana
was
invited
to
close
the
entire
``
Royal
Command
Performance
for
the
Queen
''
.


It
was
there
her
first
single
from
the
album
was
destined
for
#
1
!


The
Royal
Command
Performance
once
again
was
instrumental
in
making
the
song
a
hit
.


She
returned
to
America
to
do
second
round
dates
in
major
markets
like
New
York
.


The
tour
had
successfully
conquered
North
America
(
Canada
dates
were
after
the
first
run
of
New

The
2014
shootings
at
Parliament
Hill
were
a
series
of
shootings
that
occurred
on
October
22
,
2014
,
at
Parliament
Hill
in
Ottawa
.


at
the
canadian
national
war
memorial
,
corporal
nathan
cirillo
,
a
canadian
soldier
on
ceremonial
sentry
duty
was
fatally
shot
by
michael
unk
.


Zehaf-Bibeau
then
entered
the
nearby
Centre
Block
parliament
building
,
where
members
of
the
Parliament
of
Canada
were
attending
caucuses
.


After
wrestling
with
a
constable
at
the
entrance
,
Zehaf-Bibeau
ran
inside
and
had
a
shootout
with
parliament
security
personnel
.


He
was
shot
31
times
by
six
officers
and
died
on
scene
.


Following
the
shootings
,
the
downtown
core
of
Ottawa
was
placed
on
lockdown
and
majority
of
schools
in
Ottawa
were
on
lockdown
while
police
searched
for
any
potential
additional
threats
.


A
Royal
Canadian
Mounted
Police
(
RCMP
)
investigation
into
the
shootings
is
ongoing
.


The
attacker
,
Michael
Zehaf-Bibeau
,
was
a
32-year-old
Canadian
habitual
offender
and
drug
addict
from
Montreal
.


He
had
been
observed
by
acquaintances
exhibiting
erratic
behaviour
.


At
the
time
of
the
shooting
,
Zehaf-Bibeau
planned
to
leave
Canada
for
the
Middle
East
and
was
living
in
a
homeless
shelter
in
Ottawa
while
waiting
for
the
processing
of
his
Canadian
passport
application
.


according
to
rcmp
commissioner
bob
paulson
the
``
passport
issue
was
central
to
what
was
driving
''
unk
.


Zehaf-Bibeau
made
a
video
prior
to
the
attack
in
which
he
expressed
his
desire
to
``
kill
some
soldiers
''
and
his
motives
as
being
related
``
to
Canada
's
foreign
policy
and
in
respect
of
his
religious
beliefs
.
''


To
acquaintances
and
co-workers
,
he
had
previously
expressed
support
for
jihadists
and
others
in
the
Middle
East
resisting
the
West
's
intervention
,
but
was
not
known
to
the
police
to
be
a
terrorism
risk
.


In
his
mother
's
opinion
,
the
attack
was
the
``
last
desperate
act
''
of
someone
with
a
mental
disorder
who
felt
trapped
.


Some
Canadian
Muslim
organizations
condemned
the
attack
.


Classified
by
the
RCMP
as
a
terrorist
act
under
the
Criminal
Code
,
it
was
the
most
serious
security
breach
at
Parliament
Hill
since
the
1966
parliament
bombing
.


It
took
place
two
days
after
a
man
used
his
car
to
run
over
two
soldiers
in
Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu
,
Quebec
,
killing
one
.


The
two
incidents
,
which
attracted
international
attention
,
raised
concerns
about
the
effectiveness
of
police
actions
to
prevent
terrorist
attacks
,
the
prevention
of
radicalization
and
the
security
measures
in
place
at
federal
and
provincial
legislatures
.


the
canadian
government
had
already
prepared
a
bill
to
expand
the
courtroom
anonymity
and
surveillance
powers
of
the
canadian
security
intelligence
service
(
csis
)
,
canada
's
intelligence
agency
,
which
was
due
to
be
introduced
the
day
of
the
shootings
,
and
was
postponed
by
the
event
.


The
government
introduced
new
anti-terrorism
measures
with
the
``
Anti-terrorism
Act
,
2015
''
.


Security
at
Parliament
Hill
is
to
be
stepped
up
.


On
June
3
,
2015
it
was
reported
that
``
RCMP
officers
have
started
openly
carrying
submachine
guns
on
Parliament
Hill
as
part
of
a
visible
increase
to
...
security

The
Battle
of
Chalgrove
18
June
1643
of
the
English
Civil
War
was
a
meeting
engagement
,
or
in
17th
century
English
Civil
War
terminology
a
fight
,
that
occurred
when
a
Royalist
body
of
horse
(
cavalry
)
commanded
by
Prince
Rupert
met
a
similar
sized
Parliamentarian
mounted
force
under
the
command
of
Major
John
Gunter
.


Colonel
John
Hampden
put
himself
in
Captain
Richard
Crosse
's
troop
and
fought
as
a
trooper
.


Rupert
commanded
three
regiments
of
his
Lifeguard
(
with
a
combined
strength
of
about
1,000
)
,
while
the
Parliamentarians
fielded
three
of
the
Earl
of
Essex
’
s
troops
of
horse
,
over
150
dragoons
and
700
–
800
of
Essex
’
s
most
senior
officers
(
in
all
about
1,100
mounted
men
)
.


It
took
place
around
09:00
hours
on
the
morning
of
18
June
1643
in
Chalgrove
Field
,
northeast
of
Chalgrove
in
Oxfordshire
.


It
was
a
Royalist
(
Cavaliers
)
victory
of
such
magnitude
the
Parliamentarian
army
(
Roundheads
)
was
forced
to
leave
Oxfordshire
.


Among
the
many
senior
officers
killed
at
Chalgrove
Colonel
John
Hampden
,
Essex
's
second
in
command
,
member
of
the
Committee
of
Safetie
and
Member
of
Parliament
for
Buckinghamshire
was
the
most
notable
.


Hampden
's
name
became
synonymous
with
Chalgrove
because
100
years
after
death
his
name
and
reputation
for
truth
and
honesty
was
used
as
a
political
exemplar
.


The
supposed
exhumation
of
John
Hampden
by
Lord
Nugent
in
July
1828
ensured
that
his
name
endured
.


tropical
storm
andrea
brought
flooding
to
cuba
,
the
yucatan
peninsula
,
and
portions
of
the
east
coast
of
the
united
states
in
june
2013
.


The
first
tropical
cyclone
and
named
storm
of
the
annual
hurricane
season
,
Andrea
originated
from
an
area
of
low
pressure
in
the
eastern
Gulf
of
Mexico
on
June
5
.


Despite
strong
wind
shear
and
an
abundance
of
dry
air
,
the
storm
strengthened
while
initially
heading
north-northeastward
.


Later
on
June
5
,
it
re-curved
northeastward
and
approached
the
Big
Bend
region
of
Florida
.


Andrea
intensified
and
peaked
as
a
strong
tropical
storm
with
winds
at
65
mph
(
100
km/h
)
on
June
6
.


A
few
hours
later
,
the
storm
weakened
slightly
and
made
landfall
near
Steinhatchee
,
Florida
later
that
day
.


It
began
losing
tropical
characteristics
while
tracking
across
Florida
and
Georgia
.


Andrea
transitioned
into
an
extratropical
cyclone
over
South
Carolina
on
June
7
,
though
the
remnants
continued
to
move
along
the
East
Coast
of
the
United
States
,
until
being
absorbed
by
another
extratropical
system
offshore
Maine
on
June
10
.


Prior
to
becoming
a
tropical
cyclone
,
the
precursor
to
Andrea
dropped
nearly
12
inches
(
300
mm
)
of
rainfall
on
the
Yucatán
Peninsula
.


In
Cuba
,
the
storm
brought
flooding
,
especially
in
Pinar
del
Río
Province
.


over
1,000
people
fled
their
homes
,
mainly
along
the
unk
river
.


A
tornado
was
also
spawned
in
the
area
,
damaging
three
homes
.


In
Florida
,
the
storm
brought
heavy
rainfall
to
some
areas
,
causing
localized
flooding
.


There
were
nine
tornadoes
in
Florida
,
the
worst
of
which
touched
down
in
The
Acreage
and
downed
power
lines
and
trees
,
causing
significant
roof
damage
to
several
houses
;
there
was
also
one
injury
.


After
Andrea
transition
into
an
extratropical
storm
,
the
remnants
that
also
spawned
one
tornado
in
North
Carolina
,
though
damage
was
minor
.


Additionally
,
minor
flooding
was
reported
in
some
areas
of
the
Northeastern
United
States
.


Three
fatalities
occurred
due
to
weather-related
traffic
accidents
in
Virginia
and
New
Jersey
.


There
was
a
direct
death
reported
after
a
surfer
in
South
Carolina
went
missing
and
was
presumed
to
have
drowned
.


The
remnants
of
Andrea
also
brought
gusty
winds
to
Atlantic
Canada
,
causing
thousands
of
power
outages
in
Nova
Scotia
and
New
Brunswick
.


In
January
2012
,
Peking
University
professor
Kong
Qingdong
made
televised
remarks
suggesting
that
many
Hong
Kong
people
were
disloyal
to
China
and
still
harboured
a
colonial
mentality
.


Kong
Qingdong
called
Hong
Kong
people
``
dogs
''
in
response
to
an
online
video
posted
about
a
mainland
Chinese
child
eating
on
the
subway
,
which
is
prohibited
by
MTR
regulations
.


This
prompted
a
series
of
campaigns
against
Kong
Qingdong
in
Hong
Kong
.


About
150
people
gathered
at
the
Central
Government
's
Liaison
Office
on
22
January
to
protest
Kong
's
remarks
.


The
protests
took
place
among
a
backdrop
of
increasing
tensions
between
native
citizens
of
Hong
Kong
and
mainlanders
,
including
the
release
of
a
survey
indicating
that
Hong
Kong
people
feel
increasingly
separate
from
,
and
superior
to
,
Mainland
Chinese
people
.


At
the
time
of
the
protests
,
anti-Mainland
Chinese
sentiment
in
Hong
Kong
had
been
growing
because
of
the
large
influx
of
mainland
Chinese
mothers
arriving
in
Hong
Kong
to
give
birth
,
largely
for
their
children
to
receive
right
of
abode
in
Hong
Kong
and
the
social
services
that
came
with
it
.


The
2014
Bundy
standoff
was
an
armed
confrontation
between
supporters
of
cattle
rancher
Cliven
Bundy
and
law
enforcement
following
a
21-year
legal
dispute
in
which
the
United
States
Bureau
of
Land
Management
(
BLM
)
obtained
court
orders
directing
Bundy
to
pay
over
$
1
million
in
withheld
grazing
fees
for
Bundy
's
use
of
federally-owned
land
adjacent
to
Bundy
's
ranch
in
southeastern
Nevada
.


On
March
27
,
2014
,
145,604
acres
of
federal
land
in
Clark
County
were
temporarily
closed
for
the
``
capture
,
impound
,
and
removal
of
trespass
cattle
.
''


BLM
officials
and
law
enforcement
rangers
began
a
roundup
of
such
livestock
on
April
5
,
and
Cliven
Bundy
's
son
,
Dave
,
was
arrested
.


On
April
12
,
2014
,
a
group
of
protesters
,
some
of
them
armed
,
approached
the
BLM
``
cattle
gather
''
.


Sheriff
Doug
Gillespie
negotiated
with
Bundy
and
newly-confirmed
BLM
director
Neil
Kornze
,
who
elected
to
release
the
cattle
and
de-escalate
the
situation
.


As
of
the
end
of
2015
,
Cliven
Bundy
continued
to
graze
his
cattle
on
federal
land
and
still
had
not
paid
the
grazing
fees
.


The
ongoing
dispute
started
in
1993
,
when
,
in
protest
against
changes
in
grazing
rules
,
Bundy
declined
to
renew
his
permit
for
cattle
grazing
on
BLM-administered
public
lands
near
Bunkerville
,
Nevada
.


According
to
Bundy
,
the
federal
government
lacks
the
constitutional
authority
to
own
vast
tracts
of
lands
,
an
argument
repeatedly
rejected
by
federal
courts
.


According
to
the
BLM
,
Bundy
continued
to
graze
his
cattle
on
public
lands
without
a
permit
.


In
1998
,
Bundy
was
prohibited
by
the
United
States
District
Court
for
the
District
of
Nevada
from
grazing
his
cattle
on
an
area
of
land
later
called
the
Bunkerville
Allotment
.


In
July
2013
,
federal
judge
Lloyd
D.
George
ordered
Bundy
to
refrain
from
trespassing
on
federally
administered
land
in
the
Gold
Butte
area
of
Clark
County
.


Cliven
and
Ammon
Bundy
,
and
their
supporters
,
have
claimed
that
the
federal
government
lacks
the
authority
to
manage
public
lands
.


These
arguments
have
been
repeatedly
rejected
by
legal
scholars
and
federal
courts
,
including
the
U.S.
Supreme
Court
;
the
property
clause
of
the
United
States
Constitution
grants
plenary
authority
to
Congress
to
manage
federal
property
,
including
land
.


Kaamatan
or
Pesta
Kaamatan
is
a
form
of
harvest
festival
celebrated
annually
in
the
state
of
Sabah
in
Malaysia
.


It
is
normally
celebrated
by
the
ethnic
Kadazan-Dusuns
,
as
well
as
by
other
related
ethnic
groups
in
the
state
,
and
lasts
for
the
whole
of
the
month
of
May
,
ending
with
a
public
holiday
on
a
date
selected
by
a
priestess
known
as
the
bobohizan
.


A
beauty
pageant
known
as
Unduk
Ngadau
will
be
held
and
it
ends
the
harvest
festival
with
a
newly
crowned
Unduk
Ngadau
in
the
annual
host
district
,
Penampang
.


The
Harvest
Festival
comes
under
the
ambit
of
what
is
known
as
Momolianism
,
the
belief
system
and
life
philosophy
of
the
Kadazan-Dusun
.


There
is
also
a
dance
performance
called
the
Sumazau
,
a
singing
contest
called
Sugandoi
,
a
bodybuilding
competition
,
and
other
arts
and
crafts
performances
.


Competitions
such
as
hitting
the
gong
and
folk
sports
have
also
become
one
of
the
main
events
in
this
festival
.


Popular
drinks
during
the
festival
are
tapai
and
Kinomol
,
which
is
a
traditional
alak
drink
.


Tapai
is
drunk
from
a
small
bamboo
vessel
known
as
a
sumbiling
or
from
special
glasses
called
singgarung
,
likewise
made
from
bamboo
.

,
the
67th
season
of
Italy

they
had
Gökhan
Inler
sent

in
the
second
half
.


Juan
Manuel
Vargas
scored
Fiorentina
's
goal
.


As
Napoli
qualified
for
the
UEFA
Champions
League
by
their
league
position
,
Fiorentina
as
runners-up
qualified
for
the
Group
Stage
of
the
2014–15
UEFA
Europa
League
.


This
was
the
last
season
in
which
cup
runners-up
could
qualify
for
the
Europa
League
if
the
winner
had
already
qualified
for
the
Champions

was
marred
by
pre-match
violence
,
which
delayed
the
scheduled
kick-off
time
.


Three
Napoli

were
shot
,
one
of
whom
died
following

Tropical
Cyclone
Sose
was
a
moderate
storm
system
that
chiefly
impacted
the
island
nation
of
Vanuatu
in
early
April
2001
.


The
developing
cyclone
was
first
detected
on
April
3
,
while
situated
well
to
the
northeast
of
Vanuatu
.


As
atmospheric
conditions
became
more
conducive
to
intensification
,
the
disturbance
gradually
consolidated
as
it
drifted
toward
the
west-southwest
.


After
receiving
the
name
Sose
on
April
5
,
the
cyclone
was
driven
southeastward
,
passing
just
west
of
Espiritu
Santo
and
neighboring
islands
.


although
it
never
made
landfall
,
sose
was
particularly
expansive
,
producing
a
wide
area
of
gale-force
winds
.


The
cyclone
peaked
in
strength
between
April
7
and
8
with
maximum
10-minute
sustained
winds
of
110
km/h
(
70
mph
)
and
1-minute
sustained
winds
of
130
km/h
(
80
mph
)
,
placing
it
at
Category
2
intensity
on
the
Australian
tropical
cyclone
intensity
scale
.


Ultimately
,
stronger
wind
shear
and
an
increasingly
hostile
upper-air
pattern
took
their
toll
on
the
cyclone
as
it
progressed
due
south
;
Sose
lost
tropical
characteristics
to
the
northeast
of
Norfolk
Island
by
April
12
.


The
extratropical
remnants
of
Sose
continued
into
the
Tasman
Sea
.


Occurring
just
two
months
after
Cyclone
Paula
affected
Vanuatu
,
Sose
compounded
the
damage
already
done
by
the
previous
storm
,
especially
to
crops
and
farmlands
.


Throughout
the
island
chain
,
two
people
lost
their
lives
to
the
storm
.


Roadways
were
blocked
by
debris
and
floodwaters
,
while
schools
and
classrooms
on
several
islands
were
damaged
or
ruined
.


The
storm
destroyed
about
200
homes
around
the
nation
and
damaged
many
more
,
particularly
on
southern
Espiritu
Santo
.


The
storm
's
large
fetch
generated
enormous
swells
as
far
away
as
Australia
's
Eastern
Seaboard
,
where
surfers
took
advantage
of
the
abnormally
intense
conditions
and
two
swimmers
drowned
.


On
Maré
Island
in
New
Caledonia
,
a
man
was
swept
away
by
a
large
wave
and
presumed
dead
.


The
storm
later
produced
torrential
rainfall
and
strong
winds
over
the
North
Island
of
New
Zealand
,
sparking
damaging
freshwater
floods
and
downing
trees
and
power
lines
.

in
the
Waikato
region
led
to
a
fatal
traffic
accident
in
which
three
people
died
.


Another
individual
drowned
in
a
swollen
river
.


Sose
reportedly
contributed
to
coastal
flooding
as
far
away
as
Tonga
.


In
all
,
Sose
killed
nine
people
;
total
monetary
damage
is
unknown
.


As
a
result
of
the
storm
's
destruction
,
its
name
was
later
retired
.


On
Monday
,
December
1
,
1958
,
a
fire
broke
out
at
Our
Lady
of
the
Angels
School
in
Chicago
,
Illinois
,
shortly
before
classes
were
to
be
dismissed
for
the
day
.


The
fire
originated
in
the
basement
near
the
foot
of
a
stairway
.


The
elementary
school
was
operated
by
the
Roman
Catholic
Archdiocese
of
Chicago
and
had
an
enrollment
of
approximately
1600
students
.


A
total
of
92
pupils
and
3
nuns
ultimately
died
when
smoke
,
heat
,
fire
,
and
toxic
gases
cut
off
their
normal
means
of
escape
through
corridors
and
stairways
.


Many
more
were
injured
when
they
jumped
from
second-floor
windows
which
,
because
the
building
had
a
raised
basement
,
were
nearly
as
high
as
a
third
floor
would
be
on
level
ground
(
c.
25
ft.
)
.


The
disaster
was
the
lead
headline
story
in
American
,
Canadian
,
and
European
newspapers
.


Pope
John
XXIII
sent
his
condolences
from
the
Vatican
in
Rome
.


The
severity
of
the
fire
shocked
the
nation
and
surprised
educational
administrators
of
both
public
and
private
schools
.


The
disaster
led
to
major
improvements
in
standards
for
school
design
and
fire
safety
codes
.


the
1991
perfect
storm
,
also
known
as
the
no-name
storm
(
especially
in
the
years
immediately
after
it
took
place
)
and
the
halloween
unk
,
was
a
nor'easter
that
absorbed
hurricane
grace
,
and
ultimately
evolved
into
a
small
unnamed
hurricane
itself
late
in
its
life
cycle
.


The
initial
area
of
low
pressure
developed
off
the
coast
of
Atlantic
Canada
on
October
29
.


Forced
southward
by
a
ridge
to
its
north
,
it
reached
its
peak
intensity
as
a
large
and
powerful
cyclone
.


The
storm
lashed
the
east
coast
of
the
United
States
with
high
waves
and
coastal
flooding
before
turning
to
the
southwest
and
weakening
.


Moving
over
warmer
waters
,
the
system
transitioned
into
a
subtropical
cyclone
before
becoming
a
tropical
storm
.


It
executed
a
loop
off
the
Mid-Atlantic
states
and
turned
toward
the
northeast
.


On
November
1
,
the
system
evolved
into
a
full-fledged
hurricane
,
with
peak
sustained
winds
of
75
miles
per
hour
(
120
km/h
)
,
although
the
National
Hurricane
Center
left
it
unnamed
to
avoid
confusion
amid
media
interest
in
the
precursor
extratropical
storm
.


it
later
received
the
name
``
the
perfect
storm
''
(
playing
off
the
common
expression
)
after
a
conversation
between
boston
national
weather
service
forecaster
robert
case
and
author
sebastian
junger
.


The
system
was
the
twelfth
and
final
tropical
cyclone
,
the
eighth
tropical
storm
,
and
fourth
hurricane
in
the
1991
Atlantic
hurricane
season
.


The
tropical
system
weakened
,
striking
Nova
Scotia
as
a
tropical
storm
before
dissipating
.


Damage
from
the
storm
totaled
over
$
200
million
(
1991
USD
)
and
the
death
toll
was
thirteen
.


Most
of
the
damage
occurred
while
the
storm
was
extratropical
,
after
waves
up
to
struck
the
coastline
from
Canada
to
Florida
and
southeastward
to
Puerto
Rico
.


In
Massachusetts
,
where
damage
was
heaviest
,
over
100
homes
were
destroyed
or
severely
damaged
.


To
the
north
,
more
than
100
homes
were
affected
in
Maine
,
including
the
vacation
home
of
then-President
George
H.
W.
Bush
.


More
than
38,000
people
were
left
without
power
,
and
along
the
coast
high
waves
inundated
roads
and
buildings
.


in
portions
of
new
england
,
the
damage
was
worse
than
that
caused
by
hurricane
bob
two
months
earlier
.


Aside
from
tidal
flooding
along
rivers
,
the
storm
's
effects
were
primarily
concentrated
along
the
coast
.


A
buoy
off
the
coast
of
Nova
Scotia
reported
a
wave
height
of
,
the
highest
ever
recorded
in
the
province
's
offshore
waters
.


in
the
middle
of
the
storm
,
the
fishing
vessel
``
andrea
gail
''
sank
,
killing
her
crew
of
six
and
inspiring
the
book
,
and
later
movie
,
``
the
perfect
storm
''
.


Off
the
shore
of
New
York
's
Long
Island
,
an
Air
National
Guard
helicopter
ran
out
of
fuel
and
crashed
;
four
members
of
its
crew
were
rescued
and
one
was
killed
.


Two
people
died
after
their
boat
sank
off
Staten
Island
.


High
waves
swept
two
people
to
their
deaths
,
one
in
Rhode
Island
and
one
in
Puerto
Rico
,
and
another
person
was
blown
off
a
bridge
to
his
death
.


The
tropical
cyclone
that
formed
late
in
the
storm
's
duration
caused
little
impact
,
limited
to
power
outages
and
slick
roads
;
one
person
was
killed
in
Newfoundland
from
a
traffic
accident
related
to
the
storm
.


Cyclone
Lam
was
the
strongest
storm
to
strike
Australia
's
Northern
Territory
since
Cyclone
Monica
in
2006
.


It
formed
from
the
monsoon
trough
on
February
12
in
the
Coral
Sea
.


For
much
of
its
duration
,
the
system
moved
westward
due
to
a
ridge
to
the
south
.


the
system
crossed
over
the
cape
york
peninsula
and
moved
into
the
gulf
of
carpentaria
,
whereupon
it
gradually
organized
due
to
warm
waters
and
favorable
outflow
.


On
February
16
,
the
Bureau
of
Meteorology
(
BoM
)
classified
it
as
a
Category
1
on
the
Australian
tropical
cyclone
intensity
scale
and
gave
it
the
name
``
Lam
''
.


The
storm
intensified
further
while
drifting
toward
the
Wessel
Islands
,
developing
an
eye
and
strengthening
to
the
equivalence
of
a
minimal
hurricane
on
February
18
.


It
strengthened
to
reach
maximum
sustained
winds
of
185
km/h
(
115
mph
)
early
on
February
19
before
turning
to
the
southwest
,
making
it
a
Category
4
cyclone
.


That
day
,
it
made
landfall
on
Northern
Territory
between
Milingimbi
and
Elcho
Island
at
peak
intensity
,
and
it
rapidly
weakened
over
land
.


About
six
hours
after
Lam
moved
ashore
,
Cyclone
Marcia
struck
Queensland
as
a
Category
5
cyclone
,
marking
the
first
time
on
record
that
two
storms
of
Category
4
intensity
struck
Australia
on
the
same
day
.


In
its
formative
stages
,
Lam
produced
heavy
rainfall
and
flooding
in
Far
North
Queensland
.


Later
,
the
cyclone
's
rainfall
set
daily
precipitation
records
in
Northern
Territory
.


However
,
the
winds
caused
the
most
damage
,
with
gusts
estimated
as
high
as
230
km/h
(
145
mph
)
.


the
highest
gust
was
at
cape
wessel
on
unk
island
.


Lam
caused
considerable
destruction
,
particularly
affecting
local
aboriginal
communities
.


Total
damage
in
the
Northern
Territory
exceeded
A
$
100
million
(
US
$
78.1
million
)
.


mtbs
is
an
annual
unk
athletics
competition
(
the
largest
in
south
africa
)
held
between
four
high
schools
located
in
bellville
,
western
cape
.


The
competition
is
famous
for
the
cheerleading
by
participating
schools
.


These
schools
are
:
D.F
.


Malan
High
School
,
Tygerberg
High
School
,
Bellville
High
School
and
Stellenberg
High
School
.


The
name
is
a
derived
acronym
from
the
names
of
the
schools
in
that
order
.


The
first
MTBS
took
place
in
1994
.


This
was
the
brain
child
of
the
late
Frans
du
Toit
,
a
retired
teacher
from
JG
Meiring
High
School
in
Goodwood
and
a
part
time
sports
journalist
.


The
highlight
of
the
event
is
a
7-minute
cheerleading
performance
by
the
pavilion
of
each
school
.


This
performance
consists
of
a
medley
of
songs
during
which
the
students
effectively
create
a
``
human
LCD
screen
''
on
the
pavilion
.


This
is
achieved
by
them
opening
and
closing
their
school
blazer
at
unique
pre-determined
moments
,
with
each
student
effectively
functioning
as
a
pixel
and
thus
allowing
images
and
animations
to
be
displayed
.


Other
parts
of
the
school
uniform
(
such
as
dresses
and
socks
)
may
also
be
used
,
but
no
other
props
(
such
as
cards
)
are
allowed
.


This
performance
is
known
as
a
``
kreet
''
,
an
Afrikaans
word
which
roughly
translates
to
``
warcry
''
.


Each
``
kreet
''
adheres
to
a
specific
theme
that
has
been
chosen
by
that
particular
school
.


This
unique
style
of
cheering
attracts
large
crowds
,
and
therefore
the
event
carries
big
regional
significance
.


The
annual
attendance
is
estimated
at
12,000
spectators
.


The
size
of
the
event
and
the
impressiveness
of
the
schools
'
performances
makes
it
popular
to
parents
and
people
who
do
not
have
children
in
either
of
these
schools
alike
.


Each
year
MTBS
enjoys
strong
coverage
by
South
African
newspapers
Die
Burger
,
Tygerburger
and
Rapport
.


It
has
also
been
partly
broadcast
on
national
television
channel
SABC
2
.


Similar
events
exist
:
most
notably
in
South
Korea
.


Different
athletics
items
take
place
throughout
the
day
;
including
short
distance
sprints
,
long
distance
running
,
shot
put
,
javelin
,
long
jump
,
discus
,
high
jump
and
relay
races
.


Two
athletes
from
each
school
take
part
in
an
event
,
adding
up
to
8
athletes
in
each
event
.


Tropical
Cyclone
Helen
was
the
first
tropical
cyclone
to
bring
gale-force
winds
to
Darwin
,
Australia
since
1985
.


The
fourth
named
storm
of
the
2007–08
Australian
region
cyclone
season
,
Helen
developed
out
of
a
weak
area
of
low
pressure
in
late
December
over
the
Top
End
region
of
Australia
.


Generally
tracking
westward
,
the
system
eventually
intensified
into
a
tropical
cyclone
and
was
given
the
name
Helen
on
2
January
.


By
this
time
,
it
was
situated
over
the
Joseph
Bonaparte
Gulf
and
was
beginning
to
retrograde
eastward
.


Late
on
4
January
,
the
storm
made
landfall
near
Channel
Point
with
winds
of
95
km/h
(
60
mph
)
though
rapidly
weakened
to
a
tropical
low
within
12
hours
.


Gradually
accelerating
,
the
remnants
of
Helen
moved
over
the
Gulf
of
Carpentaria
before
striking
land
again
on
6
January
.


the
system
was
last
noted
over
the
cape
york
peninsula
on
7
january
.


From
late
December
through
6
January
,
Helen
and
its
precursor
low
produced
significant
rainfall
over
the
Northern
Territory
,
generally
amounting
between
.


One
person
drowned
in
the
Victoria
River
after
his
car
was
swept
away
in
a
flood
.


As
a
tropical
cyclone
,
Helen
produced
significant
wind
gusts
across
the
Top
End
,
peaking
at
120
km/h
(
75
mph
)
,
downing
thousands
of
trees
.


In
Darwin
,
roughly
15,000
people
were
without
power
due
to
the
storm
,
more
than
100
of
which
remained
so
four
days
after
the
storm
.


Overall
losses
from
the
storm
reached
A
$
1.3
million
(
US
$
1.1
million
)
with
an
additional
A
$
1
million
(
US
$
882,000
)
in
cleanup
costs
.


The
Atlantic
raid
of
June
1796
was
a
short
campaign
containing
three
connected
minor
naval
engagements
fought
in
the
Western
Approaches
comprising
Royal
Navy
efforts
to
eliminate
a
squadron
of
French
frigates
operating
against
British
commerce
during
the
French
Revolutionary
Wars
.


although
royal
navy
dominance
in
the
western
atlantic
had
been
established
,
french
commerce
raiders
operating
on
short
cruises
were
having
a
damaging
effect
on
british
trade
,
and
british
frigate
squadrons
regularly
patrolled
from
cork
in
search
of
the
raiders
.


One
such
squadron
comprised
the
36-gun
frigates
HMS
``
Unicorn
''
and
HMS
``
Santa
Margarita
''
,
patrolling
in
the
vicinity
of
the
Scilly
Isles
,
which
encountered
a
French
squadron
comprising
the
frigates
``
Tribune
''
and
``
Tamise
''
and
the
corvette
``
Légėre
''
.


The
opposing
forces
were
approximately
equal
in
size
,
but
the
French
,
under
orders
to
operate
against
commerce
,
not
engage
British
warships
,
attempted
to
retreat
.


The
British
frigates
pursued
closely
and
over
the
course
of
the
day
gradually
overhauled
the
French
squadron
.


at
16:00
``
santa
margarita
''
caught
``
unk
''
and
a
furious
duel
ensued
in
which
the
smaller
``
unk
''
was
badly
damaged
and
eventually
forced
to
surrender
.


``
Tribune
''
continued
its
efforts
to
escape
,
but
was
finally
caught
by
``
Unicorn
''
at
22:30
and
defeated
in
a
second
hard-fought
engagement
.


``
Légėre
''
took
no
part
in
the
action
and
was
able
to
withdraw
without
becoming
embroiled
in
either
conflict
.


five
days
later
the
french
frigate
``
proserpine
''
,
which
had
separated
from
the
rest
of
the
squadron
after
leaving
brest
,
was
searching
for
her
compatriots
off
cape
clear
in
southern
ireland
when
she
was
discovered
by
the
patrolling
british
frigate
hms
``
dryad
''
.


``
Dryad
''
successfully
chased
down
``
Proserpine
''
and
forced
the
French
ship
to
surrender
in
an
engagement
lasting
45
minutes
.


Nine
days
later
``
Légėre
''
was
captured
without
a
fight
by
another
British
frigate
patrol
.


French
casualties
in
all
three
engagements
were
very
heavy
,
while
British
losses
were
light
.


In
the
aftermath
all
four
captured
ships
were
purchased
for
service
in
the
Royal
Navy
.


The
Action
of
9
February
1799
was
a
minor
naval
engagement
of
the
French
Revolutionary
Wars
between
a
British
Royal
Navy
frigate
and
a
French
privateer
frigate
fought
west
of
the
southeastern
coast
of
what
is
now
Natal
in
South
Africa
.


The
32-gun
French
frigate
``
Prudente
''
had
since
the
start
of
the
war
been
part
of
a
squadron
operating
from
Île
de
France
(
now
Mauritius
)
.


This
squadron
had
dispersed
during
1798
,
with
the
ships
sent
on
independent
commerce
raiding
operations
across
the
British
trade
routes
in
the
Indian
Ocean
.


``
Prudente
''
had
subsequently
been
seized
in
the
autumn
of
that
year
by
Anne
Joseph
Hippolyte
de
Maurès
,
Comte
de
Malartic
,
the
Governor
of
Île
de
France
,
and
sold
to
a
private
raiding
company
.


in
early
1799
``
prudente
''
was
operating
off
south
africa
,
attacking
british
trade
passing
to
or
from
the
cape
colony
when
the
ship
was
discovered
by
british
frigate
hms
``
daedalus
''
under
captain
henry
unk
ball
.


``
Prudente
''
turned
away
and
Ball
gave
chase
,
following
the
French
ship
closely
.


After
five
hours
``
Daedalus
''
caught
``
Prudente
''
and
fired
a
raking
broadside
into
the
stern
,
disabling
the
French
ship
.


For
another
hour
the
action
continued
at
close
range
until
``
Prudente
''
was
forced
to
surrender
.


Hurricane
Wilma
was
the

A
tropical
depression
formed
in
the
Caribbean
Sea
near
Jamaica
on
October
15
,
headed
westward
,
and
intensified
into
a
tropical
storm
two
days
later
,
which
abruptly
turned
southward
and
was
named
``
Wilma
''
.


Wilma
continued
to
strengthen
,
and
eventually
became
a
hurricane
on
October
18
.


Shortly
thereafter
,
explosive
intensification
occurred
,
and
in
only
24
hours
,
Wilma
became
a
Category
5
hurricane
with
wind
speeds
of
.


Wilma
's
intensity
slowly
leveled
off
after
becoming
a
Category
5
hurricane
,
and
winds
had
decreased
to
before
it
reached
the
Yucatán
Peninsula
on
October
20
and
21
.


After
crossing
the
Yucatán
,
Wilma
emerged
into
the
Gulf
of
Mexico
as
a
Category
2
hurricane
.


As
it
began
accelerating
to
the
northeast
,
gradual
re-intensification
occurred
,
and
the
hurricane
was
upgraded
to
Category
3
status
on
October
24
.


shortly
thereafter
,
wilma
made
landfall
in
cape
romano
,
florida
with
winds
of
.


As
Wilma
was
crossing
Florida
,
it
briefly
weakened
back
to
a
Category
2
hurricane
,
but
again
re-intensified
as
it
reached
the
Atlantic
Ocean
.


The
hurricane
intensified
into
a
Category
3
hurricane
for
the
last
time
,
before
weakening
while
accelerating
northeastward
.


By
October
26
,
Wilma
transitioned
into
an
extratropical
cyclone
southeast
of
Nova
Scotia
.


Wilma
made
several
landfalls
,
with
the
most
destructive
effects
felt
in
the
Yucatán
Peninsula
of
Mexico
,
Cuba
,
and
the
U.S.
state
of
Florida
.


At
least
62
deaths
were
reported
and
damage
totaled
to
$
27.4
billion
,
of
which
$
19
billion
occurred
in
the
United
States
.


After
Wilma
,
no
other
major
hurricane
made
landfall
in
the
contiguous
United
States
until
Hurricane
Harvey
made
landfall
in
southern
Texas
on
August
26
,
2017
,
ending
a
record
period
of
11
years
10
months
.


During
this
time
,
major
Atlantic
hurricanes
occurred
slightly
more
frequently
than
average
;
they
just
did
not
make
landfall
in
the
United
States
.


Also
,
after
Wilma
,
no
hurricane
struck
the
state
of
Florida
until
Hurricane
Hermine
did
so
nearly
11
years
later
in
2016
,
and
no
major
hurricane
struck
Florida
until
Hurricane
Irma
made
landfall
in
early
September
2017
.


Severe
Tropical
Cyclone
Hamish
was
a
powerful
tropical
cyclone
that
caused
extensive
damage
to
the
Great
Barrier
Reef
and
coastal
Queensland
,
Australia
,
in
March
2009
.


the
eighth
named
storm
of
the
unk
australian
region
cyclone
season
,
hamish
developed
out
of
an
area
of
low
pressure
on
4
march
near
the
cape
york
peninsula
.


The
storm
rapidly
developed
into
a
Category
1
cyclone
on
the
Australian
intensity
scale
the
next
day
.


On
6
March
,
an
eye
developed
,
and
Hamish
strengthened
into
a
Category
3
cyclone
.


Deep
convection
developed
around
the
eye
,
fueling
further
intensification
,
which
allowed
the
storm
to
become
a
Category
5
tropical
cyclone
late
on
7
March
.


Hamish
made
its
closest
approach
to
land
on
8
March
,
but
continued
moving
southeastward
.


Eventually
,
the
cyclone
weakened
and
turned
back
towards
the
northwest
,
weakening
into
a
remnant
low
on
11
March
,
before
finally
dissipating
on
14
March
.


The
Greco-Turkish
War
of
1897
,
also
called
the
Thirty
Days
'
War
and
known
in
Greece
as
the
Black
'97
(
,
``
Mauro
'97
''
)
or
the
Unfortunate
War
(
Ατυχής
πόλεμος
,
``
Atychis
polemos
''
)
(
Turkish
:
``
1897
Osmanlı-Yunan
Savaşı
''
or
``
1897
Türk-Yunan
Savaşı
''
)
,
was
a
war
fought
between
the
Kingdom
of
Greece
and
the
Ottoman
Empire
.


Its
immediate
cause
was
the
question
over
the
status
of
the
Ottoman
province
of
Crete
,
whose
Greek
majority
long
desired
union
with
Greece
.


Despite
the
Ottoman
victory
on
the
field
,
an
autonomous
Cretan
State
under
Ottoman
suzerainty
was
established
the
following
year
(
as
a
result
of
the
intervention
of
the
Great
Powers
after
the
war
)
,
with
Prince
George
of
Greece
and
Denmark
as
its
first
High
Commissioner
.


This
was
the
first
war
effort
in
which
the
military
and
political
personnel
of
Greece
were
put
to
test
since
the
Greek
War
of
Independence
in
1821
.


For
the
Ottoman
Empire
,
this
was
also
the
first
war
effort
in
which
the
reorganized
military
personnel
were
put
to
test
.


The
Ottoman
army
was
under
the
guidance
of
a
German
military
mission
led
by
Colmar
Freiherr
von
der
Goltz
,
who
had
reorganized
it
after
the
defeat
in
the
Russo-Turkish
War
(
1877–1878
)
.


The
conflict
proved
Greece
was
wholly
unprepared
for
war
.


Plans
,
fortifications
and
weapons
were
non-existent
,
the
mass
of
the
officer
corps
was
unsuited
to
its
tasks
,
and
training
was
inadequate
.


As
a
result
,
the
numerically
superior
,
better
organized
,
equipped
and
led
Ottoman
forces
pushed
the
Greek
forces
south
out
of
Thessaly
.


The
Battle
of
Malplaquet
,
one
of
the
bloodiest
of
modern
times
,
was
fought
near
the
border
of
France
on
11
September
1709
by
the
forces
of
Louis
XIV
of
France
,
commanded
by
Marshal
Villars
,
against
a
Dutch-British
army
,
led
by
the
Duke
of
Marlborough
.


After
a
string
of
defeats
,
failure
of
the
harvest
and
the
prospect
of
invasion
,
Louis
XIV
had
appealed
to
French
patriotism
,
recruited
fresh
soldiers
and
instructed
Villars
to
use
the
country
's
last
army
to
give
battle
against
Marlborough
's
formidable
force
.


After
a
series
of
manoeuvres
,
Villars
settled
on
a
position
in
which
both
of
his
flanks
were
anchored
in
woods
.


Even
though
the
French
were
outnumbered
,
Marlborough
's
familiar
tactics
of
flank
attacks
to
draw
off
troops
from
the
centre
incurred
serious
attrition
by
massed
French
musketry
and
skilful
use
of
artillery
.


When
Marlborough
's
assault
on
the
denuded
enemy
centre
came
,
his
Allied
army
had
been
so
badly
weakened
that
the
Allies
made
no
attempt
at
pursuit
when
the
French
retreated
in
good
order
.


The
Allies
lost
20,000
men
,
twice
as
many
as
the
French
,
which
was
regarded
by
contemporaries
as
a
shocking
number
of
casualties
.


That
caused
Britain
to
question
the
sacrifices
that
might
be
required
for
Marlborough
's
campaign
to
continue
.


The
Battle
of
Malplaquet
is
often
regarded
as
a
Pyrrhic
victory
because
its
main
effect
was
to
prevent
the
nominal
winners
from
invading
France
.


The
2011–2012
Maldives
political
crisis
began
as
a
series
of
peaceful
protests
that
broke
out
in
the
Maldives
on
1
May
2011
.


They
would
continue
,
eventually
escalating
into
the
resignation
of
President
Mohamed
Nasheed
in
disputed
circumstances
in
February
2012
.


Demonstrators
were
protesting
what
they
considered
the
government
's
mismanagement
of
the
economy
and
were
calling
for
the
ouster
of
President
Mohamed
Nasheed
.


the
main
political
opposition
party
in
the
country
,
the
dhivehi
rayyithunge
party
(
maldivian
people
's
party
)
led
by
the
former
president
of
the
country
maumoon
abdul
gayoom
(
who
was
in
power
for
over
30
years
under
an
authoritarian
system
)
accused
president
nasheed
of
``
talking
about
democracy
but
not
putting
it
into
practice
.
''


The
protests
occurred
during
the
Arab
Spring
.


The
primary
cause
for
the
protests
was
rising
commodity
prices
and
a
poor
economic
situation
in
the
country
.


The
protests
led
to
a
resignation
of
President
Mohamed
Nasheed
on
7
February
2012
,
and
the
Vice
President
Mohammed
Waheed
Hassan
Manik
was
sworn
as
the
new
president
of
Maldives
.


Nasheed
stated
the
following
day
that
he
was
forced
out
of
office
at
gunpoint
,
while
Waheed
supporters
maintained
that
the
transfer
of
power
was
voluntary
and
constitutional
.


A
later
British
Commonwealth
meeting
concluded
that
it
could
not
``
determine
conclusively
the
constitutionality
of
the
resignation
of
President
Nasheed
''
,
but
called
for
an
international
investigation
.


the
maldives
'
national
commission
of
inquiry
,
appointed
to
investigate
the
matter
,
found
that
there
was
no
evidence
to
support
nasheed
's
version
of
events
.


In
April
2012
,
it
was
announced
that
new
elections
were
to
be
held
in
July
2013
;
they
eventually
took
place
later
in
2013
.


North
Korea–United
States
relations
refers
to
international
relations
between
North
Korea
and
the
United
States
.


The
political
and
diplomatic
relations
between
North
Korea
and
the
United
States
have
been
historically
hostile
,
developing
primarily
during
the
Korean
War
.


In
recent
years
relations
have
been
largely
defined
by
North
Korea
's
nuclear
program
–
six
tests
of
nuclear
weapons
,
its
development
of
long-range
missiles
capable
of
striking
targets
thousands
of
miles
away
,
and
its
ongoing
threats
to
strike
the
United
States
and
South
Korea
with
nuclear
weapons
and
conventional
forces
.


During
his
presidency
,
George
W.
Bush
referred
to
North
Korea
as
part
of
``
the
Axis
of
Evil
''
because
of
the
threat
of
its
nuclear
capabilities
.


Recently
,
North
Korea
and
the
United
States
of
America
have
started
some
formal
diplomacy
after
the
first
Trump-Kim
Summit
in
2018
.


Sweden
acts
as
the
protecting
power
of
United
States
interests
in
North
Korea
for
consular
matters
.


since
the
korean
war
,
the
united
states
has
maintained
a
strong
military
presence
in
south
korea
.


However
,
the
United
States
has
considered
,
``
de
jure
''
,
South
Korea
as
the
sole
legitimate
representative
of
all
of
Korea
.


Support
among
the
American
public
for
US
forces
to
defend
South
Korea
has
increased
steadily
.


While
it
was
at
a
mere
26
%
in
1990
,
it
has
now
nearly
tripled
to
62
%
.


A
majority
of
the
American
public
also
have
a
positive
view
of
Moon
Jae-in
,
the
South
Korean
President
as
of
2017
.


In
2015
,
according
to
Gallup
's
annual
World
Affairs
survey
,
only
9
%
of
Americans
have
a
favorable
view
of
North
Korea
,
while
87
%
of
Americans
have
a
negative
view
.


according
to
a
2014
bbc
world
service
poll
,
only
4
%
of
americans
view
north
korea
's
influence
positively
with
90
%
expressing
a
negative
view
,
one
of
the
most
negative
perceptions
of
north
korea
in
the
world
.


2017
marked
a
significant
rise
of
tensions
and
amplified
rhetoric
from
both
sides
as
Donald
Trump
took
the
presidency
,
after
it
appeared
that
North
Korea
's
nuclear
weapons
program
was
developing
at
a
faster
rate
than
previously
thought
.


The
increasing
rhetoric
(
as
well
as
Trump
's
more
aggressive
approach
to
handling
North
Korea
)
,
missile
testing
and
increasing
military
presence
on
the
Korean
Peninsula
sparked
speculation
of
a
nuclear
conflict
.


despite
fears
of
a
massive
conflict
,
a
UNK
began
to
develop
when
on
march
8
,
2018
,
the
white
house
confirmed
that
trump
would
accept
a
meeting
invitation
from
kim
jong-un
.


at
the
time
,
they
were
supposed
to
meet
in
may
.


On
May
15
,
2018
,
North
Korea
cut
off
talks
with
South
Korea
and
threatened
to
cancel
the
planned
U.S.-North
Korea
summit
,
citing
military
exercises
between
the
United
States
and
South
Korea
.


This
cancellation
was
quickly
reversed
when
Trump
received
an
uncharacteristically
friendly
reply
from
Kim
.


On
June
12
,
2018
,
Trump
and
Kim
met
at
the
summit
in
Singapore
,
in
the
first
summit
meeting
between
the
leaders
of
the
two
countries
.


over
the
course
of
the
summit
,
the
two
leaders
engaged
in
several
discussions
and
signed
a
joint
statement
calling
for
security
,
stability
,
and
lasting
peace
.


On
February
22
,
2019
an
armed
commando
assaulted
the
North
Korean
embassy
in
Madrid
,
Spain
;
Spanish
media
alleged
that
two
of
the
members
were
CIA
operatives
,
but
this
has
not
been
substantiated
,
and
is
denied
by
the
CIA
.


A
second
summit
between
Trump
and
Kim
occurred
on
February
27
and
28
,
2019
in
Vietnam
regarding
North
Korea
's
nuclear
program
,
but
ended
abruptly
without
an
agreement
.


on
june
30
,
2019
,
u.s.
president
donald
trump
,
together
with
south
korean
president
moon
jae-in

briefly
visited
north

becoming
the
first

trump
also
invited
kim
to
the
white
house
to
resume
talks
about
denuclearizing
the

Re-Invention
World
Tour
was
the
sixth
concert
tour
by
American
singer-songwriter
Madonna
.


It
supported
her
ninth
studio
album
``
American
Life
''
and
visited
North
America
and
Europe
.


Madonna
was
inspired
to
create
the
tour
,
after
taking
part
in
an
art
installation
called
X-STaTIC
PRo=CeSS
,
directed
by
photographer
Steven
Klein
.


She
incorporated
the
images
from
the
installation
in
the
tour
,
whose
name
was
in
reality
a
dig
at
Madonna
's
critics
.


A
number
of
songs
were
rehearsed
for
the
tour
,
with
twenty-one
of
them
making
the
final
setlist
.


The
tour
was
divided
into
five
segments
:
``
French
Baroque–Marie
Antoinette
''
Revival
,
``
Military–Army
''
,
``
Circus–Cabaret
''
,
``
Acoustic
''
and
``
Scottish-Tribal
''
.


The
costumes
were
developed
by
designer
Arianne
Phillips
based
on
the
concept
of
re-invention
.


The
opening
segment
displayed
performances
with
dance
in
general
.


``
Military
''
segment
displayed
performances
with
the
theme
of
warfare
.


``
Circus
''
displayed
light-hearted
performances
while
the
``
Acoustic
''
segment
performances
were
melancholy
.


The
final
``
Scottish
''
segment
had
Madonna
and
her
performers
display
energetic
dance
routines
.


The
tour
garnered
positive
reception
from
contemporary
critics
.


However
,
fellow
singer
Elton
John
accused
Madonna
of
lip-synching
during
the
tour
.


Madonna
's
representatives
denied
the
allegations
and
John
later
apologized
.


Re-Invention
Tour
was
a
commercial
success
with
total
sell-outs
and
multiple
extra
dates
being
added
.


It
became
the
highest-grossing
concert
tour
of
2004
,
earning
US
$
125
million
(
$
million
in
dollars
)
from
56
shows
,
and
an
audience
of
900,000
.


The
tour
was
awarded
with
the
Top
Tour
trophy
at
the
2004
``
Billboard
''
Touring
Awards
.


Madonna
released
a

``
I

Going
to
Tell
You

the
tour
.


The
Cabrillo
Festival
of
Contemporary
Music
is
an
annual
Festival
dedicated
to
contemporary
symphonic
music
by
living
composers
.


The
music
director
since
2017
has
been
Cristian
Măcelaru
.


According
to
Jesse
Rosen
,
CEO
of
the
League
of
American
Orchestras
,
the
Festival
is
``
distinctive
for
being
focused
entirely
on
contemporary
works
.
''


Each
year
,
a
tenured
orchestra
gathers
in
Santa
Cruz
,
California
to
rehearse
five
programs
of
contemporary
music
,
often
world
,
US
,
or
West
Coast
premieres
.


Most
of
the
composers
whose
work
is
performed
each
season
come
to
the
Festival
to
be
in
residence
and
participate
in
the
rehearsals
and
performances
of
their
work
,
as
well
as
to
participate
in
public
panel
discussions
,
lectures
,
and
concert
introductions
.


The
Festival
also
presents
guest
artists
and
ensembles
known
for
contemporary
music
performance
,
such
as
Kronos
Quartet
or
eighth
blackbird
.


The
Selma
to
Montgomery
marches
were
three
protest
marches
,
held
in
1965
,
along
the
54-mile
(
87
km
)
highway
from
Selma
,
Alabama
to
the
state
capital
of
Montgomery
.


The
marches
were
organized
by
nonviolent
activists
to
demonstrate
the
desire
of
African
American
citizens
to
exercise
their
constitutional
right
to
vote
,
in
defiance
of
segregationist
repression
;
they
were
part
of
a
broader
voting
rights
movement
underway
in
Selma
and
throughout
the
American
South
.


By
highlighting
racial
injustice
,
they
contributed
to
passage
that
year
of
the
Voting
Rights
Act
,
a
landmark
federal
achievement
of
the
civil
rights
movement
.


Southern
state
legislatures
had
passed
and
maintained
a
series
of
discriminatory
requirements
and
practices
that
had
disenfranchised
most
of
the
millions
of
African
Americans
across
the
South
throughout
the
20th
century
.


The
African-American
group
known
as
the
Dallas
County
Voters
League
(
DCVL
)
launched
a
voter
registration
campaign
in
Selma
in
1963
.


Joined
by
organizers
from
the
Student
Nonviolent
Coordinating
Committee
(
SNCC
)
,
they
began
working
that
year
in
a
renewed
effort
to
register
black
voters
.


Finding
resistance
by
white
officials
to
be
intractable
,
even
after
the
Civil
Rights
Act
of
1964
ended
legal
segregation
,
the
DCVL
invited
Rev
.


martin
luther
king
,
jr.
and
the
activists
of
the
southern
christian
leadership
conference
(
sclc
)
to
join
them
.


SCLC
brought
many
prominent
civil
rights
and
civic
leaders
to
Selma
in
January
1965
.


Local
and
regional
protests
began
,
with
3,000
people
arrested
by
the
end
of
February
.


According
to
Joseph
A.
Califano
Jr.
,
who
served
as
head
of
domestic
affairs
for
U.S.
President
Lyndon
Johnson
between
the
years
1965
and
1969
,
the
President
viewed
King
as
an
essential
partner
in
getting
the
Voting
Rights
Act
enacted
.


Califano
,
whom
the
President
also
assigned
to
monitor
the
final
march
to
Montgomery
,
said
that
Johnson
and
King
talked
by
telephone
on
January
15
to
plan
a
strategy
for
drawing
attention
to
the
injustice
of
using
literacy
tests
and
other
barriers
to
stop
black
Southerners
from
voting
,
and
that
King
later
informed
the
President
on
February
9
of
his
decision
to
use
Selma
to
achieve
this
objective
.


On
February
26
,
1965
,
activist
and
deacon
Jimmie
Lee
Jackson
died
after
being
mortally
shot
several
days
earlier
by
state
trooper
James
Bonard
Fowler
,
during
a
peaceful
march
in
nearby
Marion
,
Alabama
.


To
defuse
and
refocus
the
community
's
outrage
,
SCLC
Director
of
Direct
Action
James
Bevel
,
who
was
directing
SCLC
's
Selma
voting
rights
movement
,
called
for
a
march
of
dramatic
length
,
from
Selma
to
the
state
capital
of
Montgomery
.


Bevel
had
been
working
on
his
Alabama
Project
for
voting
rights
since
late
1963
.


The
first
march
took
place
on
March
7
,
1965
,
organized
locally
by
Bevel
,
Amelia
Boynton
,
and
others
.


State
troopers
and
county
possemen
attacked
the
unarmed
marchers
with
billy
clubs
and
tear
gas
after
they
passed
over
the
county
line
,
and
the
event
became
known
as
Bloody
Sunday
.


Law
enforcement
beat
Boynton
unconscious
,
and
the
media
publicized
worldwide
a
picture
of
her
lying
wounded
on
the
Edmund
Pettus
Bridge
.


The
second
march
took
place
March
9
.


Troopers
,
police
,
and
marchers
confronted
each
other
at
the
county
end
of
the
bridge
,
but
when
the
troopers
stepped
aside
to
let
them
pass
,
King
led
the
marchers
back
to
the
church
.


He
was
obeying
a
federal
injunction
while
seeking
protection
from
federal
court
for
the
march
.


That
night
,
a
white
group
beat
and
murdered
civil
rights
activist
James
Reeb
,
a
Unitarian
Universalist
minister
from
Boston
,
who
had
come
to
Selma
to
march
with
the
second
group
.


Many
other
clergy
and
sympathizers
from
across
the
country
also
gathered
for
the
second
march
.


The
violence
of
``
Bloody
Sunday
''
and
Reeb
's
murder
resulted
in
a
national
outcry
and
some
acts
of
civil
disobedience
,
targeting
both
the
Alabama
and
federal
governments
.


The
protesters
demanded
protection
for
the
Selma
marchers
and
a
new
federal
voting
rights
law
to
enable
African
Americans
to
register
and
vote
without
harassment
.


President
Lyndon
Johnson
,
whose
administration
had
been
working
on
a
voting
rights
law
,
held
a
historic
,
nationally
televised
joint
session
of
Congress
on
March
15
to
ask
for
the
bill
's
introduction
and
passage
.


With
Governor
Wallace
refusing
to
protect
the
marchers
,
President
Johnson
committed
to
do
so
.


The
third
march
started
March
21
.


Protected
by
1,900
members
of
the
Alabama
National
Guard
under
federal
command
,
and
many
FBI
agents
and
Federal
Marshals
,
the
marchers
averaged
10
miles
(
16
km
)
a
day
along
U.S.
Route
80
,
known
in
Alabama
as
the
``
Jefferson
Davis
Highway
''
.


The
marchers
arrived
in
Montgomery
on
March
24
and
at
the
Alabama
State
Capitol
on
March
25
.


With
thousands
having
joined
the
campaign
,
25,000
people
entered
the
capital
city
that
day
in
support
of
voting
rights
.


The
route
is
memorialized
as
the
``
Selma
To
Montgomery
Voting
Rights
Trail
''
,
and
is
designated
as
a
U.S.
National
Historic
Trail
.


The
Voting
Rights
Act
became
law
on
August
6
,
1965
.


The
2009
North
Korean
nuclear
test
was
the
underground
detonation
of
a
nuclear
device
conducted
on
Monday
,
25
May
2009
by
the
Democratic
People
's
Republic
of
Korea
.


This
was
its
second
nuclear
test
,
the
first
test
having
taken
place
in
October
2006
.


Following
the
nuclear
test
,
Pyongyang
also
conducted
several
missile
tests
.


A
scientific
paper
later
estimated
the
yield
as
2.35
kilotons
.


The
test
was
nearly
universally
condemned
by
the
international
community
.


Following
the
test
,
the
United
Nations
Security
Council
passed
Resolution
1874
condemning
the
test
and
tightening
sanctions
on
the
country
.


It
was
widely
believed
that
the
test
was
conducted
as
a
result
of
the
succession
crisis
in
the
country
.


After
Kim
Jong-Il
suffered
a
stroke
in
the
summer
of
2008
,
arrangements
were
made
for
his
third
son
,
Kim
Jong-un
,
to
take
power
upon
his
death
.


It
is
believed
the
North
Koreans
conducted
the
nuclear
test
to
show
that
,
even
in
a
time
of
possible
weakness
,
it
did
not
intend
to
give
up
its
nuclear
weapons
program
.


The
Peninsular
War
(
1807–1814
)
was
a
military
conflict
between
Napoleon
's
empire
and
Bourbon
Spain
(
assisted
by
the
United
Kingdom
and
its
ally
,
Portugal
)
,
for
control
of
the
Iberian
Peninsula
during
the
Napoleonic
Wars
.


The
war
began
when
the
French
and
Spanish
armies
invaded
and
occupied
Portugal
in
1807
,
and
escalated
in
1808
when
France
turned
on
Spain
,
previously
its
ally
.


The
war
on
the
peninsula
lasted
until
the
Sixth
Coalition
defeated
Napoleon
in
1814
,
and
is
regarded
as
one
of
the
first
wars
of
national
liberation
,
significant
for
the
emergence
of
large-scale
guerrilla
warfare
.


The
Peninsular
War
overlaps
with
what
the
Spanish-speaking
world
calls
the
``
Guerra
de
la
Independencia
Española
''
(
Spanish
War
of
Independence
)
,
which
began
with
the
Dos
de
Mayo
Uprising
on
2
May
1808
and
ended
on
17
April
1814
.


The
French
occupation
destroyed
the
Spanish
administration
,
which
fragmented
into
quarrelling
provincial
``
juntas
''
.


The
episode
remains
as
the
bloodiest
event
in
Spain
's
modern
history
,
doubling
in
relative
terms
the
Spanish
Civil
War
.


A
reconstituted
national
government
,
the
Cortes
of
Cádiz—in
effect
a
government-in-exile—fortified
itself
in
Cádiz
in
1810
,
but
could
not
raise
effective
armies
because
it
was
besieged
by
70,000
French
troops
.


British
and
Portuguese
forces
eventually
secured
Portugal
,
using
it
as
a
safe
position
from
which
to
launch
campaigns
against
the
French
army
and
provide
whatever
supplies
they
could
get
to
the
Spanish
,
while
the
Spanish
armies
and
guerrillas
tied
down
vast
numbers
of
Napoleon
's
troops
.


These
combined
regular
and
irregular
allied
forces
,
by
restricting
French
control
of
territory
,
prevented
Napoleon
's
marshals
from
subduing
the
rebellious
Spanish
provinces
,
and
the
war
continued
through
years
of
stalemate
.


The
British
Army
,
under
then
Lt.
Gen.
Sir
Arthur
Wellesley
,
later
the
1st
Duke
of
Wellington
,
guarded
Portugal
and
campaigned
against
the
French
in
Spain
alongside
the
reformed
Portuguese
army
.


The
demoralised
Portuguese
army
was
reorganised
and
refitted
under
the
command
of
Gen.
William
Beresford
,
who
had
been
appointed
commander-in-chief
of
the
Portuguese
forces
by
the
exiled
Portuguese
royal
family
,
and
fought
as
part
of
the
combined
Anglo-Portuguese
Army
under
Wellesley
.


In
1812
,
when
Napoleon
set
out
with
a
massive
army
on
what
proved
to
be
a
disastrous
French
invasion
of
Russia
,
a
combined
allied
army
under
Wellesley
pushed
into
Spain
,
defeating
the
French
at
Salamanca
and
taking
Madrid
.


In
the
following
year
Wellington
scored
a
decisive
victory
over
King
Joseph
Bonaparte
's
army
in
the
Battle
of
Vitoria
.


Pursued
by
the
armies
of
Britain
,
Spain
and
Portugal
,
Marshal
Jean-de-Dieu
Soult
,
no
longer
able
to
get
sufficient
support
from
a
depleted
France
,
led
the
exhausted
and
demoralized
French
forces
in
a
fighting
withdrawal
across
the
Pyrenees
during
the
winter
of
1813–1814
.


The
years
of
fighting
in
Spain
were
a
heavy
burden
on
France
's
Grande
Armée
.


While
the
French
were
victorious
in
battle
,
their
communications
and
supplies
were
severely
tested
and
their
units
were
frequently
isolated
,
harassed
or
overwhelmed
by
partisans
fighting
an
intense
guerrilla
war
of
raids
and
ambushes
.


The
Spanish
armies
were
repeatedly
beaten
and
driven
to
the
peripheries
,
but
they
would
regroup
and
relentlessly
hound
the
French
.


This
drain
on
French
resources
led
Napoleon
,
who
had
unwittingly
provoked
a
total
war
,
to
call
the
conflict
the
``
Spanish
Ulcer
''
.


War
and
revolution
against
Napoleon
's
occupation
led
to
the
Spanish
Constitution
of
1812
,
later
a
cornerstone
of
European
liberalism
.


The
burden
of
war
destroyed
the
social
and
economic
fabric
of
Portugal
and
Spain
,
and
ushered
in
an
era
of
social
turbulence
,
political
instability
and
economic
stagnation
.


Devastating
civil
wars
between
liberal
and
absolutist
factions
,
led
by
officers
trained
in
the
Peninsular
War
,
persisted
in
Iberia
until
1850
.


The
cumulative
crises
and
disruptions
of
invasion
,
revolution
and
restoration
led
to
the
independence
of
most
of
Spain
's
American
colonies
and
the
independence
of
Brazil
from
Portugal
.


Operation
Colossus
was
the
codename
given
to
the
first
airborne
operation
undertaken
by
the
British
military
,
which
occurred
on
10
February
1941
during
World
War
II
.


The
British
airborne
establishment
was
formed
in
June
1940
by
the
order
of
the
British
Prime
Minister
,
Winston
Churchill
,
in
response
to
the
successful
airborne
operations
conducted
by
the
German
military
during
the
Battle
of
France
.


Training
began
immediately
,
but
a
shortage
of
proper
equipment
and
training
facilities
,
as
well
as
bureaucratic
difficulties
,
meant
that
only
a
small
number
of
volunteers
could
immediately
be
trained
as
parachute
troops
.


The
first
airborne
unit
to
be
formed
was
actually
a
re-trained
Commando
unit
,
No
.


2
Commando
,
which
was
subsequently
renamed
as
No
.


11
special
air
service
battalion
and
numbered
approximately
350
officers
and
other
ranks
by
september
1940
.


the
battalion
finished
its
training
in
december
1940
,
and
in
february
1941
thirty-eight
members
of
the
battalion
,
known
as
x
troop
,
were
selected
to
conduct
an
airborne
operation
,
which
was
intended
to
test
the
capability
of
the
airborne
troops
and
their
equipment
,
as
well
as
the
ability
of
the
royal
air
force
to
accurately
deliver
them
.


The
target
chosen
for
the
operation
was
a
fresh-water
aqueduct
near
Calitri
in
southern
Italy
,
which
supplied
water
to
a
large
portion
of
the
Italian
population
as
well
as
several
ports
used
by
the
Italian
military
;
it
was
also
hoped
that
its
destruction
would
hamper
Italian
military
efforts
in
North
Africa
and
Albania
.


The
airborne
troops
were
delivered
by
converted
Armstrong
Whitworth
Whitley
medium
bombers
to
the
target
on
10
February
,
but
equipment
failures
and
navigational
errors
meant
that
a
significant
portion
of
the
troops
explosives
,
and
a
team
of
Royal
Engineer
sappers
,
landed
in
the
wrong
area
.


Despite
this
setback
the
remaining
members
of
the
troop
successfully
destroyed
the
aqueduct
and
withdrew
from
the
area
,
but
were
all
captured
by
the
Italian
authorities
within
a
short
time
;
an
Italian
translator
was
tortured
and
executed
and
one
paratrooper
managed
to
escape
captivity
,
but
the
rest
remained
as
prisoners
of
war
.


The
aqueduct
was
rapidly
repaired
before
local
water
reserves
ran
out
,
ensuring
that
the
local
population
and
the
ports
were
not
deprived
of
water
,
and
,
consequently
,
that
the
Italian
war
efforts
were
not
hampered
.


However
,
it
served
as
a
morale
boost
for
the
fledgling
airborne
establishment
,
and
the
technical
and
operational
lessons
learnt
from
the
operation
helped
the
development
of
further
airborne
operations
.


The
Charfield
railway
disaster
was
a
fatal
train
crash
which
occurred
on
13
October
1928
in
the
village
of
Charfield
in
the
English
county
of
Gloucestershire
.


The
Leeds
to
Bristol
London
,
Midland
and
Scottish
Railway
(
LMS
)
night
mail
train
failed
to
stop
at
the
signals
protecting
the
down
refuge
siding
at
Charfield
railway
station
.


The
weather
was
misty
,
but
there
was
not
a
sufficiently
thick
fog
for
the
signalman
at
Charfield
to
employ
fog
signalmen
.


A
freight
train
was
in
the
process
of
being
shunted
from
the
down
main
line
to
the
siding
,
and
another
train
of
empty
goods
wagons
was
passing
through
the
station
from
the
Bristol
(
up
)
direction
.


The
mail
train
collided
with
the
freight
train
and
was
derailed
,
coming
into
collision
with
the
up
train
underneath
the
road
bridge
to
the
north
of
the
station
.


Gas
used
to
light
the
carriages
ignited
,
and
four
carriages
were
burnt
out
.


The
driver
of
the
mail
train
claimed
that
he
had
seen
a
clear
distant
signal
on
approach
to
the
station
,
and
therefore
had
assumed
that
the

Hurricane
Jimena
was
the
second-strongest
hurricane
of
the
2009
Pacific
hurricane
season
,
and
tied
with
Hurricane
Norbert
as
the
strongest
tropical
cyclone
to
make
landfall
on

portion
of
the
Baja
California
Peninsula

Forming
from
a
tropical
wave
late
on
August
28
,
2009
,
off
of
Mexico
's
Pacific
coast
,
the
system
rapidly
intensified
into
a
Category

hurricane
on
the
next
day
.


Two
days
after
developing
,
Jimena
strengthened
into
a
Category

hurricane
.


After
peaking
close
to
Category
5
intensity
on
September
1
,
it
encountered
cold
water
and
began
to
weaken
.


When
the
hurricane
made
landfall
on
the
Baja
California
Peninsula
on
September
3
,
it
was
only
a
Category
2
hurricane
.


On
the
next
day
,
the
tropical
cyclone
entered
the
Gulf
of
California
,
though
the
storm
weakened
into
a
remnant
low
after
looping
back
eastward
towards
Baja
California
.


The
storm
's
remnants
drifted
westward
into
the
Pacific
afterward
,
before
dissipating
on

When
the
storm
made
landfall
,
Jimena
caused
$
173.9
million
USD
in
damage
.


The
system
killed
four
people
across
the
peninsula

The
Rim
Fire
was
a
massive
wildfire
that
started
in
a
remote
canyon
in
Stanislaus
National
Forest
,
in
California
.


This
portion
of
the
central
Sierra
Nevada
spans
Tuolumne
and
Mariposa
counties
.


The
fire
started
on
August
17
,
2013
,
during
the
2013
California
wildfire
season
,
and
grew
to
be
(
at
the
time
)
the
third-largest
wildfire
in
California
's
history
,
having
burned
.


,
the
Rim
Fire
was
California
's
fifth-largest
modern
wildfire
.


as
of
2011
,
the
rim
fire
is
the
largest
wildfire
on
record
in
the
sierra
nevada
mountain
range
.


The
Rim
Fire
was
fully
contained
on
Thursday
,
October
24
,
2013
after
a
nine-week
firefighting
battle
.


Due
to
a
lack
of
winter
rains
,
some
logs
smoldered
in
the
interior
portion
of
the
fire
throughout
the
winter
.


More
than
a
year
passed
before
it
was
declared
out
on
November
4
,
2014
.


The
fire
was
caused
by
a
hunter
's
illegal
fire
that
got
out
of
control
,
and
it
was
named
for
its
proximity
to
the
Rim
of
the
World
vista
point
,
a
scenic
overlook
on
Highway
120
leading
up
to
Yosemite
.


A
total
of
eleven
residences
,
three
commercial
structures
,
and
98
outbuildings
were
destroyed
in
the
fire
.


During
suppression
efforts
,
which
cost
more
than
$
127
million
(
2013
USD
)
,
a
total
of
ten
injuries
from
the
wildfire
were
reported
,
but
there
were
no
fatalities
.


Typhoon
Brian
was
the
first
in
a
series
of
tropical
cyclones
to
impact
southern
China
and
northern
Vietnam
in
October
1989
.


Originating
from
an
area
of
low
pressure
associated
with
a
monsoon
trough
in
late-September
,
Brian
quickly
organized
into
a
tropical
storm
over
the
South
China
Sea
on
September
30
.


Tracking
along
a
general
west-southwest
to
westerly
course
,
the
storm
attained
typhoon
status
on
October
1
before
making
landfall
along
the
southern
coast
of
Hainan
Island
the
following
day
.


Slight
weakening
occurred
during
Brian
's
brief
passage
of
Hainan
Island
before
the
system
entered
the
Gulf
of
Tonkin
.


The
storm
ultimately
struck
Vietnam
on
October
3
before
dissipating
the
next
day
over
Laos
.


Across
Hainan
Island
,
Brian
caused
extensive
damage
to
property
and
infrastructure
.


Nearly
185,000
homes
were
damaged
or
destroyed
by
the
storm
's
high
winds
or
flash
flooding
.


Communications
were
severely
disrupted
as
of
power
and
telephone
lines
were
downed
.


Brian
killed
40
people
and
inflicted
837
million
Renminbi
(
US
$
222
million
)
in
damage
throughout
Hainan
before
impacting
Vietnam
and
causing
further
damage
.


Significant
losses
were
reported
in
Vietnam
as
well
;
however
,
the
rapid
succession
of
Brian
and
two
other
typhoons
made
it
difficult
to
differentiate
the
losses
caused
by
each
storm
.


I
Am
...
(
sometimes
referred
to
as
the
I
Am
...
Tour
or
the
I
Am
...
World
Tour
)
was
the
fourth
concert
tour
by
American
recording
artist
Beyoncé
launched
in
support
of
her
third
studio
album
,
``
I
Am
...
Sasha
Fierce
''
(
2008
)
.


The
tour
was
announced
in
October
2008
embarked
in
March
2009
with
five
rehearsal
shows
in
North
America
.


The
tour
consisted
of
108
shows
in
total
,
visiting
the
Americas
,
Europe
,
Asia
,
Africa
,
and
Australia
.


Preparations
for
the
shows
began
eight
months
prior
to
the
beginning
of
the
tour
with
twelve-hour
rehearsals
for
two
months
.


Knowles
described
the
shows
as
her
best
and
most
theatrical
from
all
of
her
tours
.


The
set
list
for
the
concerts
included
songs
from
Knowles
'
three
studio
albums
as
well
as
several
covers
of
other
artists
and
a
Destiny
's
Child
medley
.


The
central
theme
of
the
tour
was
to
showcase
the
difference
between
Knowles
'
dual
personality
;
her
emotional
side
and
her
onstage
persona
,
Sasha
Fierce
which
was
also
demonstrated
in
the
dual
album
``
I
Am
...
Sasha
Fierce
''
.


The
show
featured
two
stages
–
the
main
one
and
a
smaller
B-stage
where
Knowles
was
transferred
during
the
middle
of
the
show
.


She
was
backed
by
an
all-female
band
,
female
background
dancers
and
a
big
LED
screen
.


Thierry
Mugler
collaborated
with
Knowles
on
the
costumes
and
had
a
creative
advisor
role
further
working
on
the
choreography
,
lighting
and
production
.


Chris
March
made
the
costumes
usable
for
stage
and
helped
in
their
making
.


For
the
ballads
,
Knowles
wore
longer
dresses
while
for
the
performances
of
the
up-tempo
songs
,
more
make-up
and
more
revealing
outfits
were
worn
.


The
fashion
and
Knowles
'
look
and
figure
received
praise
from
critics
.


I
Am
...
received
critical
acclaim
from
music
critics
who
praised
Knowles
'
performance
abilities
calling
her
the
best
female
performer
.


A
concert
in
Malaysia
was
cancelled
by
Knowles
after
several
Muslim
groups
tried
to
ban
it
although
she
agreed
to
tone
down
her
look
according
to
the
country
's
standards
.


The
tour
was
commercially
successful
grossing
$
86.0
million
from
93
shows
in
total
.


Separate
performances
of
several
songs
were
broadcast
on
different
channels
and
two
concerts
were
released
as
live
albums
;
the
live
performance
at
the
I
Am
...
Yours
revue
was
in
a
CD/DVD
format
in
2009
and
footage
of
the
tour
was
released
on
the
similarly
titled
live
album
in
2010
.


The
siege
of
Magdeburg
(
French
:
``
Siège
de
Magdebourg
''
)
was
a
siege
of
the
city
that
took
place
from
25
October
to
8
November
1806
during
the
war
of
the
Fourth
Coalition
.


A
French
force
,
initially
under
the
command
of
Marshal
Grand
Duke
of
Berg
Joachim
Murat
,
then
a
French
army
Corps
under
the
command
of
Marshal
Michel
Ney
laid
siege
and
eventually
obtained
the
surrender
of
Franz
Kasimir
von
Kleist
's
Prussian
force
that
had
taken
refuge
in
Magdeburg
,
Prussia
's
second
city
.


After
the
twin
battles
of
Jena
and
Auerstaedt
,
the
victorious
Grande
Armée
pursued
the
remains
of
the
Prussian
army
,
a
part
of
which
was
under
the
command
of
Prince
Hohenlohe
,
who
directed
it
towards
the
fortified
city
of
Magdeburg
.


Commanding
the
French
force
,
Marshal
Murat
requested
Hohenlohe
's
surrender
,
which
the
Prince
refused
,
managing
to
escape
the
besieged
fortress
.


Command
was
delegated
to
General
of
Infantry
Kleist
,
who
still
had
a
numerous
garrison
of
25,000
men
.


While
the
French
force
initially
outnumbered
the
defenders
,
Emperor
Napoleon
I
recalled
the
Army
Corps
of
Marshal
Jean-de-Dieu
Soult
,
leaving
Marshal
Ney
and
his
18,000
men
Corps
to
besiege
the
city
.


Occupying
both
banks
of
the
Elbe
,
Ney
did
not
display
sufficient
vigor
during
the
siege
,
with
military
action
reduced
to
a
mere
series
of
skirmishes
and
a
timid
sortie
attempt
by
Kleist
,
on
4
November
.


Despite
Kleist
's
initial
attempt
to
bolster
the
fading
morale
of
his
troops
by
declaring
that
he
would
surrender
Magdeburg
to
the
enemy
only
when
his
handkerchief
would
ignite
in
his
pocket
,
faced
with
the
prospect
of
a
full-scale
bombardment
,
the
Prussians
decided
to
open
negotiations
and
an
armistice
was
concluded
on
November
7
,
with
the
garrison
capitulating
the
next
day
and
evacuating
the
fortress
on
11
November
as
prisoners
of
war
.


The
2002–03
Australian
bushfire
season
was
a
particularly
extensive
bushfire
season
in
Australia
.


It
ran
predominantly
from
December
2002
to
March
2003
and
involved
over
3,000
separate
fires
in
Victoria
alone
.


The
2003
Canberra
bushfires
were
also
particularly
severe
.


The
developing
drought
in
Australia
and
well
below-average
rainfall
through
winter
and
spring
of
2002
established
conditions
conducive
to
above-average
bushfire
potential
.


During
the
2002–03
season
,
there
were
5,999
bushfires
attended
by
the
relevant
agency
Australia-wide
and
7
fatalities
,
4
of
those
from
the
January
Canberra
fires
.


Perhaps
the
most
well
known
fire
of
the
season
was
the
Eastern
Victorian
alpine
bushfires
that
burnt
in
north-eastern
Victoria
,
the
Victorian
Alps
and
Gippsland
.


This
fire
was
ignited
in
several
locations
by
multiple
lightning
strikes
and
burnt
1.12
million
hectares
of
land
over
the
course
of
2
months
.


over
15,000
personnel
were
directly
engaged
with
this
fire
complex
.


In
May
2015
,
India
was
struck
by
a
severe
heat
wave
.


,
it
has
caused
the
deaths
of
at
least
2,500
people
in
multiple
regions
.


The
heat
wave
occurred
during
the
Indian
dry
season
,
which
typically
lasts
from
March
to
July
with
peak
temperatures
in
April
and
May
.


although
it
typically
remains
hot
until
late
october
,
indian
monsoons
often
provide
some
respite
from
the
heat
.


The
South
Indian
states
of
Andhra
Pradesh
and
the
neighbouring
Telangana
,
where
more
than
1,735
and
585
people
died
respectively
,
were
the
areas
most
affected
by
the
heat
wave
.


Other
casualties
were
from
the
eastern
states
of
West
Bengal
and
Odisha
.


The
high
demand
for
electricity
to
power
air
conditioning
led
to
power
outages
in
some
cities
.


The
heat
wave
saw
the
highest
recorded
temperatures
since
1995
,
subsequently
surpassed
in
May
2016
by
a
separate
heat
wave
n
Phalodi
.


Hurricane
Betsy
,
known
as
Hurricane
Santa
Clara
in
Puerto
Rico
,
was
the
first
North
Atlantic
hurricane
to
make
landfall
in
Puerto
Rico
in
24
years
.


The
third
tropical
cyclone
of
the
1956
Atlantic
hurricane
season
,
Betsy
developed
from
a
tropical
wave
on
August
9
to
the
east
of
the
Lesser
Antilles
.


It
rapidly
developed
into
a
120
mph
(
195
km/h
)
major
hurricane
before
striking
Guadeloupe
.


There
,
Betsy
heavily
damaged
1000
houses
and
left
severe
crop
destruction
,
and
there
were
18
deaths
in
the
territory
.


As
Betsy
continued
into
the
northeastern
Caribbean
,
it
capsized
a
ship
,
killing
its
crew
of
two
.


On
August
12
,
Betsy
struck
southeastern
Puerto
Rico
and
quickly
crossed
the
island
.


Damage
was
heaviest
where
it
moved
ashore
and
in
the
territory
's
central
portion
,
and
throughout
Puerto
Rico
there
were
15,023
houses
that
were
destroyed
by
Betsy
.


Multiple
locations
reported
heavy
crop
damage
,
including
Camuy
which
reported
a
complete
loss
of
the
corn
crop
.


Hurricane
Betsy
was
the
first
hurricane
to
be
observed
from
the
San
Juan
radar
,
and
also
resulted
in
the
first
hurricane
warning
on
the
island
to
be
released
on
television
.


The
hurricane
left
$
40
million
in
damage
and
16
deaths
,
which
prompted
a
federally
declared
disaster
area
.


Locally
the
hurricane
was
known
as
the
Santa
Clara
Hurricane
.


After
exiting
Puerto
Rico
,
Betsy
brushed
the
Bahamas
before
turning
northeastward
,
becoming
extratropical
on
August
18
.


The
remnants
dissipated
two
days
later
to
the
south
of
Newfoundland
.


In
June
2013
,
a
multi-day
cloudburst
centered
on
the
North
Indian
state
of
Uttarakhand
caused
devastating
floods
and
landslides
becoming
the
country
's
worst
natural
disaster
since
the
2004
tsunami
.


The
reason
the
floods
occurred
was
that
the
rainfall
received
was
on
a
larger
scale
than
the
regular
rainfall
the
state
usually
received
.


The
debris
blocked
up
the
rivers
,
causing
major
overflow
.


The
main
day
of
the
flood
was
16
June
2013
.

The
First
Battle
of
Algeciras
was
a
naval
battle
fought
on
6
July
1801
(
17
messidor
an
IX
of
the
French
Republican
Calendar
)
between
a
squadron
of
British
Royal
Navy
ships
of
the
line
and
a
smaller
French
Navy
squadron
at
anchor
in
the
fortified
Spanish
port
of
Algeciras
in
the
Strait
of
Gibraltar
.


The
British
outnumbered
their
opponents
,
but
the
French
position
was
protected
by
Spanish
gun
batteries
and
the
complicated
shoals
that
obscured
the
entrance
to
Algeciras
Bay
.


The
French
squadron
,
under
Contre-Amiral
Charles
Linois
,
had
stopped
at
Algeciras
``
en
route
''
to
the
major
Spanish
naval
base
at
Cadiz
,
where
they
were
to
form
a
combined
French
and
Spanish
fleet
for
operations
against
Britain
and
its
allies
in
the
French
Revolutionary
Wars
.


The
British
,
under
Rear-Admiral
Sir
James
Saumarez
,
sought
to
eliminate
the
French
squadron
before
it
could
reach
Cadiz
and
form
a
force
powerful
enough
to
overwhelm
Saumarez
and
launch
attacks
against
British
forces
in
the
Mediterranean
Sea
.


Sailing
directly
from
his
blockade
station
off
Cadiz
,
Saumarez
's
squadron
consisted
of
six
ships
of
the
line
,
twice
the
number
under
Linois
's
command
.


Discovering
the
French
at
anchor
in
Algeciras
on
the
morning
of
6
July
,
Saumarez
launched
an
immediate
attack
on
the
anchorage
through
the
complicated
shoals
of
Algeciras
Bay
.


although
the
initial
attack
caused
severe
damage
to
the
french
ships
,
light
winds
and
shallow
water
led
to
the
british
ship
hms
``
hannibal
''
grounding
under
heavy
fire
while
the
french
vessels
were
driven
on
shore
to
prevent
their
capture
.


With
his
intentions
frustrated
,
Saumarez
ordered
his
squadron
to
withdraw
,
five
of
his
ships
limping
out
of
the
bay
while
the
battered
``
Hannibal
''
remained
trapped
.


Isolated
and
unable
to
manoeuvre
,
Captain
Solomon
Ferris
on
``
Hannibal
''
endured
the
enemy
fire
for
another
half
an
hour
before
surrendering
his
ship
.


Both
sides
had
suffered
severe
damage
and
casualties
,
but
both
were
also
aware
that
the
battle
would
inevitably
be
rejoined
and
so
the
aftermath
of
the
British
defeat
was
one
of
frenzied
activity
at
Gibraltar
,
Algeciras
and
Cadiz
.


While
the
British
and
French
squadrons
conducted
hasty
repairs
,
the
French
and
Spanish
fleet
at
Cadiz
was
prepared
for
a
rescue
mission
,
a
heavy
squadron
arriving
at
Algeciras
on
12
July
.


As
the
Spanish
squadron
departed
with
Linois
's
ships
,
they
were
attacked
again
by
Saumarez
's
squadron
at
the
Second
Battle
of
Algeciras
and
caught
at
night
by
faster
and
more
manoeuvrable
ships
,
which
resulted
in
the
British
inflicting
heavy
losses
on
the
Spanish
rearguard
but
failing
for
a
second
time
to
destroy
the
French
squadron
.


The
Norwalk
rail
accident
occurred
on
May
6
,
1853
,
in
Norwalk
,
Connecticut
,
and
was
the
first
major
U.S.
railroad
bridge
disaster
;
48
were
killed
when
a
train
travelling
at
50
mph
plunged
into
the
Norwalk
Harbor
off
of
an
open
draw
(
swing
)
bridge
.


The
accident
occurred
on
the
New
York
and
New
Haven
Railroad
where
it
crosses
a
small
inlet
of
Long
Island
Sound
via
a
swing
bridge
.


The
approach
from
New
York
is
around
a
sharp
curve
,
so
there
was
a
signal
indicating
if
the
bridge
was
passable
by
trains
:
a
red
ball
mounted
upon
a
tall
pole
.


at
08:00
that
morning
,
the
boston
express
left
new
york
with
200
passengers
driven
by
a
substitute
driver
for
whom
this
was
the
third
transit
of
the
route
.


The
train
comprised
two
baggage
and
five
passenger
cars
.


On
approaching
the
bridge
,
the
driver
neglected
to
check
the
signal
and
only
became
aware
that
the
bridge
was
open
when
within
of
it
.


The
bridge
had
been
opened
for
the
passage
of
the
steamship
``
Pacific
''
,
which
had
just
passed
through
.


The
driver
applied
the
brakes
and
reversed
the
engine
,
but
was
unable
to
stop
in
time
.


He
and
the
fireman
leapt
clear
before
the
bridge
and
escaped
serious
injury
.


The
engine
itself
flew
across
the
gap
,
striking
the
opposite
abutment
some
below
the
level
of
the
track
and
sinking
into
of
water
.


The
baggage
cars
came
to
rest
atop
the
locomotive
;
the
front
of
the
first
passenger
car
was
crushed
against
the
baggage
cars
and
then
submerged
as
the
second
passenger
car
came
to
rest
on
top
of
it
.


The
third
passenger
car
broke
in
two
;
the
front
half
hanging
down
over
the
edge
of
the
abutment
;
the
rear
remaining
on
the
track
.


Most
of
the
48
dead
and
30
injured
were
in
the
first
passenger
car
.


A
further
eight
people
were
reported
missing
.


Many
doctors
were
travelling
on
the
train
,
returning
from
the
Sixth
Annual
Meeting
of
the
American
Medical
Association
in
New
York
;
seven
of
them
were
killed
.


Amongst
the
unhurt
was
Dr.
Gurdon
Wadsworth
Russell
,
who
wrote
an
account
of
the
accident
for
the
``
Hartford
Courant
''
in
which
he
says
that
the
dead
``
presented
all
the
symptoms
of
asphyxia
from
drowning
,
and
were
probably
drowned
at
once
,
being
confined
and
pressed
by
broken
cars
.


Oh
,
what
a
melancholy
scene
that
!
''


As
a
result
of
the
public
panic
and
indignation
caused
by
the
accident
,
the
Connecticut
Legislature
imposed
a
law
requiring
every
train
in
the
state
to
come
to
a
dead
halt
before
crossing
any
opening
bridge
.


The
engineer
was
charged
with
gross
negligence
and
held
primarily
responsible
for
the
disaster
.


A
similar
accident
occurred
eleven
years
later
in
Canada
with
even
greater
loss
of
life
,
the
St-Hilaire
train
disaster
.


Rebellion
was
an
annual
professional
wrestling
pay-per-view
(
PPV
)
event
held
by
the
World
Wrestling
Federation
(
called
World
Wrestling
Entertainment
in
2002
)
and
broadcast
exclusively
in
the
United
Kingdom
.


Rebellion
was
also
shown
on
the
Viewers
Choice
service
in
Canada
,
but
was
never
televised
in
the
United
States
.


Rebellion
had
its
own
theme
song
titled
``
Rebellion
''
.


The
2001
event
features
Invasion
period
for
the
WWF
,
which
ended
at
the
following
pay-per-view
.


All
matches
have
one
member
of
the
WWF
taking
on
one
member
of
the
Alliance
.


over
the
course
of
the
evening
,
the
wwf
won
six
matches
,
which
the
alliance
won
three
.


In
2002
,
it
was
a
SmackDown
!


brand
exclusive
show
.


This
event
would
be
final
Rebellion
event
after
all
UK-exclusive
pay-per-views
ceased
in
2003
.

only
,
the
festival
expanded
to
incorporate
a
second
stage
in
2006
.


Known
simply
as
The
Unsigned
Stage
,
it
was
designed
to
provide
a
platform
for
the
next
generation
of
metal
talent
to
reach
a
wider
audience
.


In
2010
it
was
renamed
The
New
Blood

.


2007
saw
further
expansion
with
the
addition
of
a
third
stage
,
originally
called
The
Lava
Stage
which
in
2009
became
the
Sophie
Lancaster

.


In
2010
the
capacity
of
this
stage
was
increased
and
it
became
the
festival
's
second
stage
.


bloodstock
open
air
was
conceived
as
an
extension
of
the
original
bloodstock
indoor
festival
which
ran
from
2001
until
2006
at
derby
assembly
rooms
.


After
an
amicable
parting
in
2006
with
his
business
partner
Vince
Brotheridge
,
in
2007
Paul
Gregory
brought
his
daughters
and
son
Vicky
Hungerford
,
Rachael
Greenfield
and
Adam
Gregory
on
board
as
directors
.


``
It
was
an
obvious
move
for
me
,
''
he
explained
,
``
as
all
of
them
had
been
working
on
the
festival
from
its
inception
.


They
have
brought
their
talents
to
the
fore
as
the
festival
’
s
continued
growth
is
very
much
due
to
their
commitment
.
''


in
2010
,
heaven
&
hell
was
scheduled
to
headline
bloodstock
open
air
,
but
pulled
out
due
to
the
death
of
singer
ronnie
james
dio
.


The
main
stage
at
the
festival
was
subsequently
renamed
as
the
``
Ronnie

Dio
stage
''
in
tribute
to
him
.

The
Leyenda
de
Azul
(
Spanish
for
``
the
Blue
Legend
''
)
is
a
lucha
libre
tournament
held
seven
times
by
the
Mexican
professional
wrestling
promotion
Consejo
Mundial
de
Lucha
Libre
(
CMLL
)
between
2000
and
2008
and
again
in
2011
and
2012
.


The
tournament
honors
Blue
Demon
,
or
``
Demonio
Azul
''
as
he
's
sometimes
referred
to
.


The
tournament
is
not
nearly
as
prestigious
as
CMLL
's
annual
``
Leyenda
de
Plata
''
tournament
.


The
winner
is
given
a
plaque
with
a
Blue
Demon
mask
on
it
and
a
championship
belt
featuring
Blue
Demon
as
well
.


All
tournaments
have
taken
place
in
Arena
México
in
Mexico
City
and
all
were
held
on
Fridays
during
CMLL
's
Super
Viernes
show
.


In
2009
Blue
Demon
Jr.
threatened
to
take
legal
action
against
CMLL
on
behalf
of
the
National
Wrestling
Alliance
over
CMLL
's
use
of
three
NWA
branded
championships
.


While
CMLL
did
not
publicly
respond
to
the
threat
they
dropped
the
tournament
from
their
schedule
for
two
years
.


In
July
2011
,
CMLL
,
still
not
on
good
terms
with
Blue
Demon
Jr.
,
announced
the
return
of
the
tournament
.


The
tournament
would
instead
be
endorsed
by
Blue
Demon
's
biological
son
and
Blue
Demon
Jr.
's
adopted
brother
,
El
Hijo
de
Blue

Wild
in
the
Country
was
a
music
festival
organized
by
record
label
Renaissance
and
held
from
2004
to
2007
.


The
first
Wild
in
the
Country
event
was
held
at
Shugborough
Hall
in
Staffordshire
,
England
on
1
May
2004
.


Acts
who

Gigwise.com
describes
Wild
in
the
Country
as
``
the
ideal
festival
for
lovers
of
electronic
music
.
''


and
notes
that
the
festival
is
part
of
a
Renaissance
tradition
of
holding
gigs
in
picturesque
settings
like
Allerton
Castle
and
Shugborough
Hall
.


The
last
festival
was
at
Knebworth
Park
starting
on
30
June
2007
with
Underworld
,
Hot
Chip
,
and
Sasha
and
Digweed
.


The
2008
festival
scheduled
to
be
held
at
Knebworth
Park
,
Hertfordshire
on
5
July
was
canceled
two
days
prior
to
the
event
``
due
to
lower
than
expected
ticket
sales
and
a
key
investor
withdrawing
at
the
last
minute
,
leaving
the
event
in
an
unsustainable
position
.
''


The
decision
came
a
week
after
headliner
Björk
canceled
her
appearance
having
failed
to
come
to
terms
with
the
organizers
over
staging
logistics
.


Intense
Tropical
Cyclone
Dina
was
a
cyclone
that
caused
record
flooding
across
parts
of
Réunion
.


Originating
from
a
tropical
disturbance
on
15
January
2002
near
the
Chagos
Archipelago
,
the
precursor
to
Dina
quickly
developed
within
a
region
favoring
tropical
cyclogenesis
.


By
January
17
,
the
system
had
developed
enough
organized
convection
as
it
moved
southwestward
to
be
declared
a
tropical
depression
.


Rapid
intensification
occurred
shortly
thereafter
,
with
the
system
attaining
winds
in
excess
of
120
km/h
(
75
mph
)
on
January
18
.


Dina
achieved
its
peak
intensity
on
January
20
as
an
intense
tropical
cyclone
with
maximum
sustained
winds
of
215
km/h
(
130
mph
)
.


Hours
after
reaching
hits
strength
,
the
storm
bypassed
Rodrigues
Island
about
to
its
north
.


On
January
21
,
the
storm
brushed
Mauritius
and
Réunion
as
an
intense
tropical
cyclone
before
turning
southward
.


Once
on
a
southward
course
,
steady
weakening
ensued
and
the
system
eventually
transitioned
into
an
extratropical
cyclone
on
January
25
.


The
remnants
of
the
storm
accelerated
southeastward
and
were
last
noted
on
January
28
before
being
absorbed
into
a
polar
trough
.


Across
Mauritius
and
Réunion
,
torrential
rains
and
destructive
winds
from
the
cyclone
resulted
in
extensive
to
``
catastrophic
''
damage
.


The
entire
island
of
Mauritius
lost
power
during
the
storm
and
widespread
structural
damage
took
place
.


Agricultural
and
property
damage
amounted
to
US
$
47
million
and
US
$
50
million
respectively
in
the
republic
.


Nine
fatalities
were
attributed
to
the
storm
in
Mauritius
:
five
off
the
coast
of
Rodrigues
Island
and
four
on
the
main
island
.


More
extensive
damage
was
seen
on
Réunion
where
up
to
of
rain
fell
over
three
days
.


Record
to
near-record
flooding
destroyed
many
homes
,
washed
out
roads
,
and
caused
catastrophic
agricultural
damage
.


Destructive
winds
,
measured
up
to
also
crippled
communications
.


In
all
,
six
people
died
on
the
island
and
losses
were
estimated
at
€200
million
(
US
$
190

the
exodus
tour
was
a
concert
tour
organised
to
support
the
album
``
exodus
''
by
bob
marley
&
the
wailers
.


The
tour
began
at
the
in
Paris
,
France
,
on
tuesday
10
May
1977
,
and
involuntarily
ended
with
four
shows
at
the
Rainbow
Theatre
in
London
in
early
June
;
actually
there
were
six
shows
planned
to
be
performed
in
London
,
but
the
last
two
shows
had
been
cancelled
due
to
Marley
's
serious
toe
injury
he
received
in
a
football
friendly
game
with
French
journalists
just
before
the
tour
's
start
in
Paris
.


Subsequently
,
the
tour
's
second
leg
in
the
United
States
had
first
been
postponed
and
then
definitely
cancelled
.


The
last
show
of
the
tour
has
been
released
on
VHS
and
DVD
,
labeled
``
Live
!


at
the
Rainbow
''
.


It
is
reported
that
all
four
shows
have
been
recorded
and
taped
on
video
.


The
cancellation
of
the
U.S.
leg
is
for
many
people
the
main
reason
for
Marley
's
underrated
reputation
in
the
U.S.
,
as
the
``
Exodus
''
album
is
said
to
be
Marley
's
international
breakthrough
whereby
he
achieved
international
superstardom
;
``
Exodus
''
was
honoured
the
Greatest
Album
of
the
Century
by
TIME
Magazine
in
2000
.


While
on
the
tour
Marley
performed
for
the
first
time
in
Belgium
and
Denmark
.


the
1804
snow
hurricane
(
also
known
as
the
storm
of
october
1804
)
was
the
first
tropical
cyclone
in
recorded
history
known
to
produce
snowfall
,
with
hurricane
ginny
in
1963
and
hurricane
sandy
in
2012
being
the
next
such
systems
to
do
so
.


An
unusual
late-season
storm
in
1804
,
it
yielded
vast
amounts
of
snow
,
rain
,
and
powerful
winds
across
the
northeastern
United
States
.


Prior
to
its
approach
towards
the
East
Coast
of
the
United
States
,
it
passed
through
the
Caribbean
Sea
on
4
October
,
and
later
emerged
near
Georgetown
,
South
Carolina
.


By
early
on
9
October
,
a
trough
near
the
Virginia
Capes
turned
the
disturbance
toward
New
England
.


Soon
thereafter
,
the
hurricane
's
abundant
moisture
clashed
with
an
influx
of
cold
Canadian
air
,
leading
to
the
deepening
of
the
resulting
pressure
gradient
and
provoking
inland
intensification
.


While
situated
over
Massachusetts
,
it
attained
its
peak
intensity
of
110
mph
(
175
km/h
)
,
undergoing
an
extratropical
transition
.


Even
as
it
drifted
towards
the
Canadian
maritimes
,
consequently
gradually
weakening
,
precipitation
persisted
for
another
two
days
before
the
snowstorm
finally
subsided
on
11
October
.


Due
to
its
unusual
nature
,
both
heavy
snowfall
and
strong
winds
caused
a
swath
of
devastation
stretching
from
the
Mid-Atlantic
states
to
northern
New
England
.


In
the
Middle-Atlantic
region
,
moderate
damage
occurred
at
sea
but
little
was
noted
inland
.


In
New
England
,
strong
gusts
inflicted
significant
damage
to
numerous
churches
.


Widespread
residential
damage
,
in
contrast
,
was
mostly
negligible
and
had
no
lasting
consequences
.


Thousands
of
trees
were
knocked
over
,
obstructing
roads
and
fiscally
damaging
the
timber
industry
throughout
the
region
.


Cold
temperatures
,
wet
snow
,
and
high
winds
downed
numerous
branches
in
fruit
orchards
,
froze
potato
crops
,
flattened
dozens
of
barns
,
and
killed
over
a
hundred
cattle
.


In
general
,
the
agriculture
,
shipping
,
timber
,
and
livestock
trades
suffered
most
acutely
following
the
passage
of
the
snow
hurricane
,
while
structural
damage
was
widespread
but
generally
inconsequential
.


The
storm
's
most
severe
effects
were
concentrated
at
sea
and
led
to
a
majority
of
the
hurricane
's
deaths
.


Winds
swept
dozens
of
watercraft
and
multiple
ships
ashore
,
while
high
waters
capsized
many
others
.


Several
wharves
were
destroyed
,
subsequently
harming
local
shipping
businesses
as
a
consequence
.


Snow
and
rainfall
totals
varied
widely
between
states
,
with
a
clear
delineation
between
areas
that
received
frozen
precipitation
and
rainfall
in
the
Northeast
.


Areas
of
Massachusetts
received
up
to
of
rain
,
in
contrast
to
snow
totals
upward
of
measured
in
Vermont
.


In
all
,
the
hurricane
caused
more
than
15
deaths
at
sea
and
one
inland
,
and
also
resulted
in
at
least
$
100,000
(
1804
USD
)
in
damage
.


The
snow
hurricane
of
1804
,
generally
described
as
the
most
severe
storm
in
the
United
States
since
the
Great
Colonial
Hurricane
of
1635
nearly
200
years
earlier
,
set
several
major
precedents
which
have
only
infrequently
occurred
since
.


It
was
the
first
known
tropical
cyclone
to
generate
snowfall
,
and
its
early
and
extensive
accumulations
throughout
New
England
were
unprecedented
and
unusually
heavy
.


The
boxing
competition
at
the
2000
Summer
Olympics
in
Sydney
was
held
at
the
Sydney
Convention
and
Exhibition
Centre
in
Darling
Harbour
.


The
event
was
only
open
to
men
and
bouts
were
contested
over
four
rounds
of
two
minutes
each
.


Five
judges
scored
the
fighters
in
real
time
and
the
boxer
with
the
most
points
at
the
end
was
the
winner
.


Like
other
Olympic
combat
sports
,
two
bronze
medals
are
awarded
;
in
the
case
of
boxing
,
both
losing
semi-finalists
receive
a
bronze
medal
,
with
no
further
play-off
.


As
a
result
,
the
quarter-final
essentially
equates
to
a
bronze
medal
match
,
a
semi-final
to
a
silver
medal
match
,
and
the
final
to
a
gold
medal
match
.


48
medals
are
therefore
available
,
half
of
which
are
bronze
medals
.


The
Waco
siege
was
the
siege
of
a
compound
belonging
to
the
religious
sect
Branch
Davidians
,
carried
out
by
American
federal
and
Texas
state
law
enforcement
,
as
well
as
the
U.S.
military
,
between
February
28
and
April
19
,
1993
.


the
branch
davidians
were
led
by
david
koresh
and
were
headquartered
at
mount
carmel
center
ranch
in
the
community
of
axtell
,
texas
,
13
miles
(
21
kilometers
)
east-northeast
of
waco
.


Suspecting
the
group
of
stockpiling
illegal
weapons
,
the
Bureau
of
Alcohol
,
Tobacco
,
and
Firearms
(
ATF
)
obtained
a
search
warrant
for
the
compound
and
arrest
warrants
for
Koresh
and
a
select
few
of
the
group
's
members
.


The
incident
began
when
the
ATF
attempted
to
raid
the
ranch
.


An
intense
gun
battle
erupted
,
resulting
in
the
deaths
of
four
government
agents
and
six
Branch
Davidians
.


upon
the
atf
's
failure
to
raid
the
compound
,
a
siege
lasting
51
days
was
initiated
by
the
federal
bureau
of
investigation
(
fbi
)
.


Eventually
,
the
FBI
launched
an
assault
and
initiated
a
tear
gas
attack
in
an
attempt
to
force
the
Branch
Davidians
out
of
the
ranch
.


during
the
attack
,
a
fire
engulfed
mount
carmel
center
.


This
resulted
in
the
deaths
of
76
Branch
Davidians
,
including
David
Koresh
.


The
events
of
the
siege
and
attack
are
disputed
by
various
sources
.


A
particular
controversy
ensued
over
the
origin
of
the
fire
;
an
internal
Justice
Department
investigation
concluded
in
2000
that
sect
members
had
started
the
fire
.


The
events
thirteen
miles
from
Waco
,
and
the
law
enforcement
siege
at
Ruby
Ridge
less
than
twelve
months
earlier
,
have
been
cited
by
commentators
as
catalysts
for
the
Oklahoma
City
bombing
by
Timothy

Terry
Nichols

US
Airways
Flight
1549
was
an
Airbus
A320
which
,
in
the
climbout
after
takeoff
from
New
York
City
's
LaGuardia
Airport
on
January
15
,
2009
,
struck
a
flock
of
Canada
geese
just
northeast
of
the
George
Washington
Bridge
and
consequently
lost
all
engine
power
.


Unable
to
reach
any
airport
,
pilots
Chesley
Sullenberger
and
Jeffrey
Skiles
glided
the
plane
to
a
ditching
in
the
Hudson
River
off
Midtown
Manhattan
.


All
155
people
aboard
were
rescued
by
nearby
boats
,
and
there
were
few
serious
injuries
.


The
accident
came
to
be
known
as
the
``
Miracle
on
the
Hudson
''
,
and
a
National
Transportation
Safety
Board
official
described
it
as
``
the
most
successful
ditching
in
aviation
history
''
.


The
Board
rejected
the
notion
that
the
pilot
could
have
avoided
ditching
by
returning
to
LaGuardia
or
diverting
to
nearby
Teterboro
Airport
.


the
pilots
and
flight
attendants
were
awarded
the
master

of
the
guild
of

in
recognition
of
their
``
heroic

The
2017
FIFA
Confederations
Cup
was
the
10th
and
final
FIFA
Confederations
Cup
,
a
quadrennial
international
men
's
football
tournament
organised
by
FIFA
.


It
was
held
in
Russia
,
from
17
June
to
2
July
2017
,
as
a
prelude
to
the
2018
FIFA
World
Cup
.


Russia
was
announced
as
the
host
on
2
December
2010
after
the
country
was
awarded
the
hosting
rights
of
the
2018
FIFA
World
Cup
.


The
matches
were
played
in
four
different
stadiums
across
four
cities
:
Saint
Petersburg
,
Moscow
,
Kazan
,
and
Sochi
.


It
was
the
first
time
Russia
has
hosted
the
tournament
,
and
the
third
time
the
Confederations
Cup
has
been
held
in
the
European
continent
.


As
hosts
,
Russia
qualified
automatically
for
the
tournament
;
they
were
joined
by
the
six
winners
of
the
FIFA
confederation
championships
and
the
2014
FIFA
World
Cup
champions
,
Germany
.


The
final
tournament
was
played
in
two
stages
:
a
group
stage
and
a
latter
knockout
stage
.


In
the
group
stage
,
each
team
played
three
games
in
a
group
of
four
,
with
the
winners
and
runners-up
from
each
group
advancing
to
the
knockout
stage
.


In
the
knockout
stage
,
the
four
teams
competed
in
single-elimination
matches
,
beginning
with
the
semi-finals
and
ending
with
the
final
match
of
the
tournament
.


A
third-place
match
was
played
between
the
two
losing
semi-finalist
teams
.


The
defending
champions
,
Brazil
,
who
won
the
previous
three
Confederation
Cups
(
2005
,
2009
,
2013
)
,
failed
to
qualify
for
the
first
time
since
1995
following
their
loss
on
penalties
to
Paraguay
in
the
quarter-finals
of
the
2015
Copa
América
.


2015
AFC

winners
Australia
became
the
first
team
to
qualify
from
multiple
confederations
,
having
previously
represented
the
OFC
in
1997
,
2001
and
2005

BOAC
Flight
712
(
callsign
``
Speedbird
712
''
)
was
a
British
Overseas
Airways
Corporation
(
BOAC
)
service
operated
by
a
Boeing
707-465
from
London
Heathrow
Airport
bound
for
Sydney
via
Zurich
and
Singapore
.


On
Monday
8
April
1968
,
it
suffered
an
engine
failure
on
takeoff
that
quickly
led
to
a
major
fire
.


The
engine
fell
off
the
aircraft
in
flight
.


After
the
aircraft
had
made
a
successful
emergency
landing
,
confusion
over
checklists
and
distractions
from
the
presence
of
a
check
pilot
contributed
to
the
deaths
of
five
of
the
127
on
board
.


The
actions
taken
by
those
involved
in
the
accident
resulted
in
the
award
of
the
George
Cross
posthumously
to
stewardess
Barbara
Jane
Harrison
.


Two
other
crew
members
received
awards
;
a
BEM
and
an
MBE
.


As
a
result
of
the
accident
,
BOAC
changed
the
checklists
for
engine
severe
failures
and
engine
fires
,
combining
them
both
into
one
checklist
,
the
``
engine
fire
or
severe
failure
''
checklist
.


the
hundred
years
'
war
was
a
series
of
conflicts
waged
from
1337
to
1453
by
the
house
of
plantagenet
,
rulers
of
the
kingdom
of
england
,
against
the
french
house
of
valois
,
over
the
right
to
rule
the
kingdom
of
france
.


Each
side
drew
many
allies
into
the
war
.


It
was
one
of
the
most
notable
conflicts
of
the
Middle
Ages
,
in
which
five
generations
of
kings
from
two
rival
dynasties
fought
for
the
throne
of
the
largest
kingdom
in
Western
Europe
.


The
war
marked
both
the
height
of
chivalry
and
its
subsequent
decline
,
and
the
development
of
strong
national
identities
in
both
countries
.


Tensions
between
the
crowns
of
France
and
England
can
be
traced
back
to
the
origins
of
the
English
royal
family
itself
,
which
was
French
(
Norman
,
and
later
,
Angevin
)
in
origin
.


For
this
reason
,
English
monarchs
had
historically
held
not
only
the
English
crown
,
but
also
titles
and
lands
within
France
,
the
possession
of
which
made
them
vassals
to
the
kings
of
France
.


The
status
of
the
English
king
's
French
fiefs
was
a
major
source
of
conflict
between
the
two
monarchies
throughout
the
Middle
Ages
.


French
monarchs
systematically
sought
to
check
the
growth
of
English
power
,
stripping
away
lands
as
the
opportunity
arose
,
particularly
whenever
England
was
at
war
with
Scotland
,
an
ally
of
France
.


over
the
centuries
,
english
holdings
in
france
had
varied
in
size
,
at
some
points
dwarfing
even
the
french
royal
domain
;
by
1337
,
however
,
only
gascony
was
left
to
the
english
.


In
1316
,
a
principle
was
established
denying
women
succession
to
the
French
throne
(
later
retroactively
attributed
to
the
ancient
Salic
law
)
.


In
1328
,
Charles
IV
of
France
died
without
sons
or
brothers
.


His
closest
male
relative
was
his
nephew
Edward
III
of
England
,
whose
mother
,
Isabella
of
France
,
was
sister
of
the
deceased
king
.


Isabella
claimed
the
throne
of
France
for
her
son
,
but
the
French
rejected
it
,
maintaining
that
Isabella
could
not
transmit
a
right
she
did
not
possess
.


Furthermore
,
political
sentiment
favoured
a
Frenchman
for
the
crown
rather
than
a
foreign
prince
.


the
throne
passed
instead
to
philip
,
count
of
valois
,
a
patrilineal
cousin
of
charles
iv
,
who
would
become
philip
vi
of
france
,
the
first
king
of
the
house
of
valois
.


The
English
had
not
expected
their
claim
to
meet
with
success
,
and
did
not
press
the
matter
when
it
was
denied
.


However
,
disagreements
between
Philip
and
Edward
induced
the
former
to
confiscate
the
latter
's
lands
in
France
,
and
in
turn
prompted
Edward
III
to
reassert
his
claim
to
the
French
throne
.


Several
overwhelming
English
victories
in
the
war—especially
at
Crécy
,
Poitiers
,
and
Agincourt—raised
the
prospects
of
an
ultimate
English
triumph
,
and
persuaded
the
English
to
continue
pouring
money
and
manpower
into
the
war
over
many
decades
.


However
,
the
greater
resources
of
the
French
monarchy
prevented
the
English
kings
from
ever
completing
the
conquest
of
France
.


starting
in
1429
,
decisive
french
victories
at
UNK
,
patay
,
unk
,
and
castillon
concluded
the
war
in
favour
of
the
house
of
valois
,
with
england
permanently
losing
most
of
its
possessions
on
the
continent
.


Historians
commonly
divide
the
war
into
three
phases
separated
by
truces
:
the
Edwardian
War
(
1337–1360
)
,
the
Caroline
War
(
1369–1389
)
,
and
the
Lancastrian
War
(
1415–1453
)
.


Local
conflicts
in
neighbouring
areas
,
which
were
contemporarily
related
to
the
war
,
including
the
War
of
the
Breton
Succession
(
1341–1365
)
,
the
Castilian
Civil
War
(
1366–1369
)
,
the
War
of
the
Two
Peters
(
1356–1369
)
in
Aragon
,
and
the
1383–85
crisis
in
Portugal
,
were
availed
of
by
the
parties
to
advance
their
agendas
.


Later
historians
adopted
the
term
``
Hundred
Years
'
War
''
as
a
historiographical
periodisation
to
encompass
all
of
these
events
,
thus
constructing
the
longest
military
conflict
in
European
history
.


The
war
owes
its
historical
significance
to
multiple
factors
.


By
its
end
,
feudal
armies
had
been
largely
replaced
by
professional
troops
,
and
aristocratic
dominance
had
yielded
to
a
democratisation
of
the
manpower
and
weapons
of
armies
.


although
primarily
a
dynastic
conflict
,
the
war
gave
impetus
to
ideas
of
french
and
english
nationalism
.


The
wider
introduction
of
weapons
and
tactics
supplanted
the
feudal
armies
where
heavy
cavalry
had
dominated
,
and
artillery
became
important
.


The
war
precipitated
the
creation
of
the
first
standing
armies
in
Western
Europe
since
the
time
of
the
Western
Roman
Empire
,
thus
helping
to
change
their
role
in
warfare
.


With
respect
to
the
belligerents
,
in
France
,
civil
wars
,
deadly
epidemics
,
famines
,
and
bandit
free-companies
of
mercenaries
reduced
the
population
drastically
.


In
England
,
political
forces
over
time
came
to
oppose
the
costly
venture
.


The
dissatisfaction
of
English
nobles
,
resulting
from
the
loss
of
their
continental
landholdings
,
as
well
as
the
general
shock
at
losing
a
war
in
which
investment
had
been
so
great
,
became
factors
leading
to
the
Wars
of
the
Roses
(
1455–1487
)
.


Pan
Am
Flight
73
was
a
Pan
American
World
Airways
flight
from
Bombay
,
India
,
to
New
York
,
with
scheduled
stops
in
Karachi
,
Pakistan
and
Frankfurt
,
West
Germany
.


On
September
5
,
1986
,
the
Boeing
747-121
serving
the
flight
was
hijacked
while
on
the
ground
at
Karachi
by
four
armed
Palestinian
men
of
the
Abu
Nidal
Organization
.


The
aircraft
,
with
360
passengers
on
board
,
had
just
arrived
from
Bombay
.


A
grand
jury
later
concluded
that
the
militants
were
planning
to
use
the
hijacked
airliner
to
pick
up
Palestinian
prisoners
in
both
Cyprus
and
Israel
.


Forty-three
passengers
were
injured
or
killed
during
the
hijacking
,
including
nationals
from
India
,
the
United
States
,
Pakistan
,
and
Mexico
.


All
the
hijackers
were
arrested
and
sentenced
to
death
in
Pakistan
.


However
,
the
sentences
were
later
commuted
to
life
in
prison
.


Neerja
Bhanot
,
head
attendant
on
the
flight
,
posthumously
received
India
's
highest
peacetime
award
for
bravery
,
the
Ashok
Chakra
Award
for
her
efforts
to
save
passengers
'
lives
during
the
course
of
the
hijacking
.


The
Catalan
Way
2014
(
)
,
or
``
V
''
,
was
a
large
gathering
in
Barcelona
on
11
September
2014
,
the
National
Day
of
Catalonia
,
in
support
of
the
Catalan
self-determination
referendum
of
2014
and
of
Catalan
independence
from
Spain
.


It
was
organized
by
``
Now
is
the
Time
''
,
a
unified
campaign
organised
and
funded
by
the
Assemblea
Nacional
Catalana
(
ANC
)
and
the
Òmnium
Cultural
.


Two
massive
senyeres
(
Catalan
flags
)
,
created
by
demonstrators
wearing
red
and
yellow
T-shirts
forming
a
giant
human
mosaic
,
filled
the
Diagonal
and
the
Gran
Via
,
and
came
together
at
the
vortex
in
Plaça
de
les
Glòries
,
forming
a
giant
``
V
''
,
symbolizing
``
victory
''
,
``
vote
''
and
``
will
''
(
)
.


The
``
V
''
was
11
kilometers
in
length
and
about
200,000
square
meters
in
area
.


Estimates
of
the
attendance
varied
:
though
the
Spanish
government
's
office
in
Catalonia
put
it
at
about
500,000
,
Barcelona
's
Municipal
Police
put
it
at
1.8
million
.


An
independent
statistical
analysis
by
the
Autonomous
University
of
Barcelona
calculated
that
900,000
people
attended
.


The
organisers
,
the
grassroots
Assemblea
Nacional
Catalana
,
said
it
was
one
of
the
biggest
peaceful
mobilizations
in
European
history
.


The
demonstration
followed
similar
protests
in
2010
,
2012
and
2013
(
the
original
Catalan
Way
)
.


It
was
followed
by
the
Free
Way
to
the
Catalan
Republic
(
2015
)
and
Go
ahead
,
Catalan
Republic
(
2016
)

The
Balance
Tour
was
a
concert
tour
by
hard
rock
band
Van
Halen
promoting
their
album
Balance
.


It
was
dubbed
the
``
Ambulance
''
Tour
by
Eddie
Van
Halen
due
to
his
hip
injury
caused
by
avascular
necrosis
,
and
his
brother
,
drummer
Alex
Van
Halen
wearing
a
neck
brace
for
most
of
the
tour
,
due
to
rupturing
three
vertebrae
in
his
neck
.


Consequently
,
Eddie
was
a
lot
more
static
on
stage
.


This
would
be
the
group
's
last
tour
with
Sammy
Hagar
on
vocals
until
2004
,
when
he
briefly
rejoined
the
band
for
a
tour
.


The
opening
night
in
Pensacola
,
and
a
combination
of
footage
from
the
two
Toronto
shows
were
broadcast
on
Pay-Per-View
.


The
band
had
not
performed
any
shows
as
an
opening
act
in
over
a
decade
,
but
on
this
tour
they
opened
for
veteran
act
Bon
Jovi
for
several
sold-out
dates
at
stadiums
due
to
Bon
Jovi
's
huge
appeal
overseas
.


Collective
Soul
,
Skid
Row
,
Our
Lady
Peace
,
and
Brother
Cane
opened
for
Van
Halen
on
the
North
American
legs
of
the
tour
.


The
Zoot
Suit
Riots
were
a
series
of
conflicts
on
June
3–8
,
1943
in
Los
Angeles
,
California
,
United
States
,
which
pitted
American
servicemen
stationed
in
Southern
California
against
Mexican-American
youths
who
were
residents
of
the
city
.


It
was
one
of
the
dozen
wartime
industrial
cities
that
suffered
immigration-related
riots
in
the
summer
of
1943
,
along
with
Mobile
,
Alabama
;
Beaumont
,
Texas
;
Detroit
,
Michigan
;
and
New
York
City
.


American
servicemen
and
white
civilians
attacked
and
stripped
children
,
teenagers
,
and
youths
who
wore
zoot
suits
,
ostensibly
because
they
considered
the
outfits
,
which
were
made
from
a
lot
of
fabric
,
to
be
unpatriotic
during
World
War
II
.


Rationing
of
fabric
was
required
at
the
time
for
the
war
effort
.


The
conflicts
were
rooted
in
racism
against
Mexicans
and
Mexican-Americans
.


While
most
of
the
violence
was
directed
toward
Mexican-American
youth
,
young
African-American
and
Filipino-Americans
who
were
wearing
zoot
suits
were
also
attacked
.


The
Zoot
Suit
Riots
were
related
to
fears
and
hostilities
aroused
by
the
coverage
of
the
Sleepy
Lagoon
murder
trial
,
following
the
killing
of
a
young
Latino
man
in
a
barrio
near
Los
Angeles
.


The
riot
appeared
to
trigger
similar
attacks
that
year
against
Latinos
in
Chicago
,
San
Diego
,
Oakland
,
Evansville
,
Philadelphia
,
and
New
York
City
.


The
1992
Sunday
League
was
the
twenty-fourth
competing
of
English
cricket
’
s
Sunday
League
.


There
was
no
sponsor
for
this
season
.


The
competition
was
won
for
the
first
time
by
Middlesex
County
Cricket
Club
.


Durham
were
accorded
first-class
status
at
the
start
of
the
1992
season
,
and
joined
the
competition
for
the
first
time
.


They
also
won
their
first
match
on
19
April
versus
Lancashire
.


Australian
overseas
player
Dean
Jones
scored
114
,
the
Durham
's
first
century
in
county
cricket
.


Middlesex
equalled
Sussex
's
1982
record
of
14
wins
in
a
season
.


Their
opening
batsman
Desmond
Haynes
was
the
competition
's
leading
run
scorer
.


Hampshire
's
off-spinner
Shaun
Udal
was
the
leading
wicket
taker
.


This
season
was
to
the
final
one
with
teams
wearing
traditional
white
clothing
.


The
following
season
had
new
sponsors
and
each
team
would
wear
its
own
coloured
uniform
.


In
the
early
hours
of
31
August
1997
,
Diana
,
Princess
of
Wales
died
in
hospital
after
being
injured
in
a
car
crash
in
a
road
tunnel
in
Paris
,
France
.


Her
partner
,
Dodi
Fayed
,
and
their
driver
,
Henri
Paul
,
were
pronounced
dead
at
the
scene
.


Their
bodyguard
,
Trevor
Rees-Jones
,
survived
serious
injuries
.


Media
blamed
the
erratic
behaviour
of
paparazzi
following
the
car
.


A
French
investigation
in
1999
found
that
Paul
,
who
lost
control
of
the
vehicle
at
high
speed
while
intoxicated
and
under
the
effects
of
prescription
drugs
,
was
solely
responsible
for
the
crash
.


He
was
the
deputy
head
of
security
at
the
Hôtel
Ritz
and
had
earlier
goaded
paparazzi
waiting
for
Diana
and
Fayed
outside
the
hotel
.


Anti-depressants
and
traces
of
an
anti-psychotic
in
his
blood
may
have
worsened
Paul
's
inebriation
.


No
evidence
was
found
that
paparazzi
were
near
the
car
when
it
crashed
.


The
jury
at
a
British
inquest
in
2008
returned
a
verdict
of
unlawful
killing
through
grossly
negligent
driving
by
Paul
and
the
paparazzi
.


It
was
also
found
that
none
of
the
occupants
of
the
car
was
wearing
a
seat
belt
.


Diana
was
36
years
old
.


Her
death
caused
a
substantial
outpouring
of
worldwide
grief
,
and
her
funeral
was
watched
by
an
estimated
2.5
billion
people
.


The
Royal
Family
were
criticised
in
the
press
for
their
reaction
to
Diana
's
death
.


Money
Ca
n't
Buy
was
a
one-off
concert
show
held
on
15
November
2003
at
entertainment
venue
Carling
Apollo
,
London
,
to
promote
Australian
recording
artist
Kylie
Minogue
's
ninth
studio
album
``
Body
Language
''
.


It
was
titled
so
as
no
tickets
were
offered
for
sale
publicly
and
only
invited
guests
and
competition
winners
attended
the
show
.


William
Baker
and
Alan
MacDonald
served
as
creative
and
art
directors
,
respectively
,
while
Michael
Rooney
and
Steve
Anderson
worked
on
the
choreography
and
musical
arrangements
.


Display
hardware
manufacturer
Barco
provided
LED
displays
for
showing
graphics
as
backdrops
to
the
performances
.


Minogue
wore
five
different
costumes
,
designed
by
fashion
houses
such
as
Balenciaga
,
Chanel
,
and
Helmut
Lang
,
for
the
75
minutes-long
show
.


The
total
cost
of
staging
the
concert
was
£1
million
.


Minogue
primarily
performed
tracks
from
``
Body
Language
''
during
the
show
,
although
songs
from
her
past
albums
were
also
included
in
the
set
list
.


It
was
split
in
four
segments
:
``
Paris
by
Night
''
,
``
Bardello
''
,
``
Electro
''
and
``
On
Yer
Bike
''
.


Critical
reception
towards
the
show
was
generally
favourable
,
with
compliments
directed
at
the
visuals
and
inclusion
of
past
songs
.


Critics
also
praised
the
show
's
1980s-influences
and
its
Parisian
imagery
.


The
concert
was
streamed
live
on
AOL.com
and
broadcast
on
television
channels
ITV1
and
Network
Ten
a
few
days
later
.


It
was
also
filmed
and
released
as
a
DVD
,
entitled
``
Body
Language
Live
''
,
on
12
July
2004
.


The
DVD
performed
well
commercially
in
Australia
and
the
United
Kingdom
,
where
it
received
a
platinum
and
gold
certification
respectively
.


The
March
17
,
2007
anti-war
protest
was
an
anti-war
demonstration
sponsored
by
ANSWER
Coalition
that
marched
from
Constitution
Gardens
in
Washington
,
D.C.
to
The
Pentagon
in
Arlington
,
Virginia
.


The
date
was
selected
to
coincide
with
the
fourth
anniversary
of
the
invasion
of
Iraq
,
and
also
the
40th
anniversary
of
a
similar
anti-war
march
on
October
21
,
1967
.


Organizers
estimated
15,000
to
30,000
protesters
attended
,
while
the
police
gave
informal
estimates
of
10,000
to
20,000
.


cindy
sheehan
,
a
prominent
opponent
of
the
war
,
and
who
lost
a
son
in
the
war
,
declared
,
``
we
want
the
people
in
the
white
house
out
of
our
house
and
arrested
for
crimes
against
humanity
,
''
and
called
the
president
and
his
military
advisers
``
war
criminals
.
''


Other
protesters
demanded
that
the
U.S.
stop
perpetrating
human
rights
abuses
,
and
that
the
prison
camps
at
Guantánamo
Bay
,
Cuba
be
closed
.


Several
protesters
,
dressed
in
orange
outfits
and
black
bags
over
their
heads
to
simulate
the
prisoners
,
portrayed
the
image
that
America
has
lost
its
moral
standing
and
has
now
become
a
nation
that
oppresses
human
rights
.


There
was
a
sub-protest
organized
primarily
by
members
of
the
Students
for
a
Democratic
Society
(
SDS
)
organization
,
which
formed
a
black
bloc
at
the
corner
of
23rd
Street
and
Constitution
Avenue
NW
in
Washington
,
and
marched
alongside
the
main
group
for
much
of
the
march
's
route
.


The
black
bloc
separated
just
before
the
main
march
entered
the
Pentagon
's
north
parking
lot
,
and
attempted
to
march
closer
to
the
Pentagon
.


Pentagon
Police
and
Virginia
State
Police
officers
responding
to
the
splinter
march
used
concussive
grenades
and
threatened
to
use
less
than
lethal
chemical
crowd
control
agents
.


The
black
bloc
had
a
two
to
three
hour
sit-in
,
and
after
that
took
a
vote
and
decided
to
return
to
Washington
.


They
followed
the
route
of
the
original
protest
,
except
now
blocking
traffic
,
and
knocking
over
construction
barricades
.


The
bloc
was
ultimately
dispersed
near
where
the
protest
originally
gathered
by
MPDC
officers
on
bicycles
,
and
Park
Police
officers
in
riot
gear
.


at
least
two
were
arrested
.


The
war
protest
was
preceded
by
a
prayer
service
in
the
National
Cathedral
Friday
night
,
the
evening
before
the
march
.


Speakers
at
the
ecumenical
protest
called
the
war
in
Iraq
``
an
offense
against
God
.
''


after
prayers
in
the
cathedral
,
the
christian
protesters
walked
with
battery-powered
candles
toward
the
white
house
and
continued
the
calls
for
peace
.


After
dark
police
arrested
222
of
the
protesters
near
Lafayette
Park
for
disobeying
lawful
order
,
or
crossing
a
police
line
.


The
gathering
included
Christians
from
several
groups
including
a
coalition
``
Christian
Peace
Witness
for
Iraq
''
.


Despite
the
cold
weather
,
wind
,
and
snow
,
the
National
Cathedral
was
filled
with
Christians
praying
for
an
end
to
the
war
,
and
two
other
smaller
churches
hosted
some
of
the
overflow
crowds
.


There
were
also
a
number
of
counter-protesters
,
including
the
Gathering
of
Eagles
,
a
group
formed
to
show
support
for
the
war
in
Iraq
,
the
troops
,
and
the
government
,
and
which
also
claimed
to
be
protecting
various
monuments
from
any
vandalism
by
anti-war
marchers
.


It
included
,
among
others
,
members
of
the
Rolling
Thunder
motorcycle
group
,
and
veterans
and
families
who
have
or
have
lost
family
members
in
Iraq
.


The
Allied
siege
of
La
Rochelle
occurred
during
the
Second
World
War
in
1944–45
,
when
Allied
troops
invaded
France
.


La
Rochelle
was
an
important
German
naval
base
on
the
Atlantic
for
surface
ships
and
submarines
,
from
which
U-boat
campaigns
were
launched
.


La
Rochelle
and
other
harbours
such
as
Royan
and
Saint-Nazaire
,
became
``
Atlantic
pockets
''
still
occupied
by
the
Germans
,
which
were
bypassed
by
the
main
thrust
of
the
Allied
invasion
,
as
was
Dunkirk
on
the
North
Sea
.


The
city
was
liberated
only
at
the
very
end
of
the
war
,
nine
months
after
the
Liberation
of
Paris
,
after
the
general
German
capitulation
on
8
May
1945
.


The
siege
(
September
1944
–
May
1945
)
.


The
pocket
of
La
Rochelle
(
``
Poche
de
La
Rochelle
''
)
,
one
of
the
Atlantic
pockets
,
was
a
zone
extending
to
a
distance
of
about
10
kilometers
around
La
Rochelle
,
reinforced
by
an
anti-tank
trench
.


After
the
allied
landing
in
Normandy
in
June
1944
,
a
large
number
of
German
troops
had
regrouped
in
the
area
.


The
allied
siege
of
the
pocket
of
La
Rochelle
lasted
from
September
1944
to
May
1945
,
without
heavy
bombardment
.


La
Rochelle
remained
in
German
hands
until
the
end
of
the
war
,
much
as
other
Atlantic
harbours
such
as
Brest
,
Saint-Nazaire
,
Lorient
,
Gironde-Nord
,
Gironde-Sud
because
the
main
thrust
of
the
war
was
more
concerned
with
focusing
on
Germany
itself
.


Just
surrounding
the
city
was
considered
wiser
than
conducting
a
frontal
attack
,
as
the
city
would
ultimately
fall
anyway
with
the
end
of
the
war
.


The
German
command
also
wished
to
keep
control
of
the
coastal
garrisons
and
rejected
evacuation
in
order
to
maintain
a
threat
on
Allied
shipping
in
the
Atlantic
.


In
total
39,500
French
civilians
were
under
the
rule
of
Vice-Admiral
Schirlitz
,
who
served
as
the
Naval
Commander
Atlantic
Coast
,
from
1943
in
La
Rochelle
until
the
end
of
the
war
.


The
German
garrison
numbered
22,000
men
.


During
the
siege
the
Allies
still
allowed
for
electricity
,
wood
and
some
supplies
to
be
delivered
in
order
to
alleviate
the
ordeal
of
the
civilian
population
inside
the
walls
of
the
city
.


Agreements
were
made
between
the
French
and
the
German
occupation
force
in
La
Rochelle
,
to
the
effect
that
the
French
would
not
attack
and
that
in
exchange
the
Germans
would
not
destroy
the
port
installations
of
La
Rochelle-La
Pallice
.


In
effect
,
La
Rochelle
was
surrounded
efficiently
enough
,
and
suffered
enough
from
the
siege
,
with
harbour
facilities
being
damaged
by
Allied
air
attacks
,
that
the
Germans
were
unable
to
launch
major
U-Boat
attacks
on
Allied
shipping
for
the
duration
of
the
siege
.


However
,
every
week
a
Luftwaffe
plane
was
able
to
break
through
the
blockade
and
supply
the
garrison
.


In
order
to
raise
the
morale
of
German
troops
in
La
Rochelle
,
the
propaganda
movie
``
Kolberg
''
,
celebrating
resistance
against
the
French
in
1806
,
was
sent
in
by
Göring
and
premiered
simultaneously
in
Berlin
and
La
Rochelle
on
30
January
1945
.

From
spring

,
General
De
Larminat
was
put
in
charge
of
French
forces
in
the
region
,
with
the
objective
of
capturing
La

.


The
United
States
was
to
give
logistical
support
as
well
as

The
American
Indian
Wars
(
also
known
as
the
Indian
Wars
or
the
First
Nations
Wars
;
)
is
the
collective
name
for
the
various
armed
conflicts
that
were
fought
by
European
governments
and
colonists
,
and
later
by
the
United
States
and
Canadian
governments
and
American
and
Canadian
settlers
,
against
various
American
Indian
and
First
Nation
tribes
.


These
conflicts
occurred
in
North
America
from
the
time
of
the
earliest
colonial
settlements
in
the
17th
century
until
the
1920s
.


The
various
Indian
Wars
resulted
from
a
wide
variety
of
factors
,
including
cultural
clashes
,
land
disputes
,
and
criminal
acts
committed
by
both
sides
.


The
European
powers
and
their
colonies
also
enlisted
Indian
tribes
to
help
them
conduct
warfare
against
each
other
's
colonial
settlements
.


After
the
American
Revolution
,
many
conflicts
were
local
to
specific
states
or
regions
and
frequently
involved
disputes
over
land
use
;
some
entailed
cycles
of
violent
reprisal
.


The
British
Royal
Proclamation
of
1763
,
included
in
the
Constitution
of
Canada
,
prohibited
white
settlers
from
taking
the
lands
of
indigenous
peoples
in
Canada
without
signing
a
treaty
with
them
.


It
continues
to
be
the
law
in
Canada
today
,
and
11
Numbered
Treaties
,
covering
most
of
the
First
Nations
lands
,
limited
the
number
of
such
conflicts
.


As
white
settlers
spread
westward
across
America
after
1780
,
the
size
,
duration
,
and
intensity
of
armed
conflicts
increased
between
settlers
and
various
cultures
of
Indians
.


The
climax
came
in
the
War
of
1812
,
which
resulted
in
the
defeat
of
major
Indian
coalitions
in
the
Midwest
and
the
South
.


Conflict
with
settlers
became
much
less
common
and
were
resolved
by
treaty
,
often
through
sale
or
exchange
of
territory
between
the
federal
government
and
specific
tribes
.


The
Indian
Removal
Act
of
1830
authorized
the
US
government
to
enforce
the
Indian
removal
from
east
of
the
Mississippi
River
to
the
west
,
what
the
government
considered
the
sparsely
populated
American
frontier
.


(
Many
tribes
had
extensive
territory
in
this
area
,
however
.
)


The
federal
US
policy
of
removal
was
eventually
refined
in
the
West
,
as
American
settlers
kept
expanding
their
territories
,
to
relocate
Indian
tribes
to
specially
designated
and
federally
protected
reservations
.


The
Lochnagar
mine
south
of
the
village
of
La
Boisselle
in
the
Somme
``
département
''
was
an
underground
explosive
charge
,
secretly
planted
by
the
British
during
the
First
World
War
,
ready
for
1
July
1916
,
the
first
day
on
the
Somme
.


The
mine
was
dug
by
the
Tunnelling
Companies
of
the
Royal
Engineers
under
a
German
field
fortification
known
as
(
Swabian
Height
)
.


The
British
named
the
mine
after
Lochnagar
Street
,
the
British
trench
from
which
the
gallery
was
driven
.


The
charge
at
Lochnagar
was
one
of
19
mines
that
were
placed
beneath
the
German
lines
on
the
British
section
of
the
Somme
front
,
to
assist
the
infantry
advance
at
the
start
of
the
battle
.


The
mine
was
sprung
at
on
1
July
1916
and
left
a
crater
deep
and
wide
,
which
was
captured
and
held
by
British
troops
.


The
attack
on
either
flank
was
defeated
by
German
small-arms
and
artillery
fire
,
except
on
the
extreme
right
flank
and
just
south
of
La
Boisselle
,
north
of
the
Lochnagar
Crater
.


The
crater
has
been
preserved
as
a
memorial
and
a
religious
service
is
held
each
1
July
.

The
Valencia
Metro
derailment
occurred
in
Valencia
,
Spain
's
third
largest
city
,
on
3
July
2006
at
1
p.m.
CEST
(
1100
UTC
)
between
Jesús
and
Plaça
d'Espanya
stations
on
the
Line
1
of
the
Metrovalencia
mass
transit
system
.


At
least
43
people
were
killed
and
more
than
ten
were
seriously
injured
.


``
El
País
''
reports
that
Valencian
forensic
scientists
have
identified
all
but
one
of
the
victims
—
a
woman
whose
family
has
not
claimed
her
.


Twenty-one
of
the
victims
were
from
Torrent
,
a
locality
seven
kilometres
from
Valencia
and
the
train
's
destination
.


Five
more
victims
were
from
the
city
of
Valencia
itself
,
and
two
were
from
Paiporta
,
which
is
also
nearby
.


It
was
not
immediately
clear
what
caused
the
crash
,
which
occurred
at
a
curve
just
outside
Jesús
station
.


However
,
data
from
the
train
's
black
box
showed
that
the
train
's
speed
at
the
derailment
point
was
80
km/h
(
50
mph
)
,
which
means
it
was
travelling
at
twice
the
normal
40
km/h
speed
for
this
curve
.


Defective
wheels
or
the
possible
collapse
of
a
tunnel
wall
were
also
being
considered
as
possible
causes
.


Both
the
Valencian
government
spokesman
Vicente
Rambla
and
Mayor
Rita
Barberá
have
called
the
accident
a
``
chance
''
event
.


However
,
the
trade
union
CC.OO
.


has
accused
the
authorities
of
``
rushing
''
to
say
anything
but
admit
that
Line
1
is
in
a
state
of
``
constant
deterioration
''
with
a
``
failure
to
carry
out
maintenance
''
.


It
has
been
reported
that
a
part
of
the
wall
in
the
tunnel
between
Plaça
d'Espanya
and
Jesús
stations
in
the
southwestern
neighbourhood
of
Patraix
may
have
collapsed
,
causing
the
derailment
of
one
of
the
carriages
,
which
in
turn
caused
the
carriage
behind
it
to
overturn
.


The
fire
brigade
,
medics
and
local
police
went
to
the
scene
after
a
passenger
in
the
crashed
train
called
the
emergency
services
at
about
1:03
p.m.
(
1103
UTC
)
.


The
incident
came
days
before
Pope
Benedict
XVI
was
due
to
visit
Valencia
for
the
World
Meeting
of
the
Families
,
attended
by
one
million
pilgrims
.


It
also
coincided
with
the
end
to
one
of
the
pre-America
's
Cup
2007
match
racings
.


Both
events
led
to
an
increase
in
tourists
in
the
area
.


The
Pope
offered
his
condolences
and
prayed
at
Jesús
station
,
the
scene
of
the
accident
.


The
2008
attacks
on
Christians
in
southern
Karnataka
refer
to
the
wave
of
attacks
directed
against
Christian
churches
and
prayer
halls
in
the
Indian
city
of
Mangalore
and
the
surrounding
area
of
southern
Karnataka
in
September
and
October
2008
by
Hindu
organizations
,
Bajrang
Dal
and
the
Sri
Ram
Sena
.


The
attacks
were
widely
perceived
by
Christians
in
southern
Karnataka
to
be
punishment
from
right-wing
Hindu
nationalist
organisations
because
they
had
been
outspoken
about
Christian
persecution
in
Orissa
,
after
the
assassination
of
Hindu
monk
Swami
Lakshmanananda
Saraswati
allegedly
by
the
local
Christian
community
and
also
because
the
New
Life
Fellowship
Trust
(
NLFT
)
,
a
non-denominational
Christian
Church
,
was
alleged
by
Bajrang
Dal
to
be
responsible
for
forced
conversions
of
Hindus
to
Christianity
.


Several
isolated
incidents
against
Christians
were
reported
from
17
August
onwards
,
and
on
29
August
some
45,000
institutions
across
India
participated
in
a
``
prayer
for
peace
and
communal
harmony
''
in
response
to
the
ongoing
anti-Christian
violence
in
Orissa
.


The
attacks
began
on
14
September
,
when
a
group
of
youths
from
the
Bajrang
Dal
went
inside
the
chapel
of
Adoration
Monastery
of
the
Sisters
of
St-Clare
in
Hampankatta
and
desecrated
it
.


Some
20
religious
buildings
and
colleges
were
damaged
in
towns
and
villages
in
the
Mangalore
taluk
and
other
parts
of
the
Dakshina
Kannada
,
Udupi
,
Chikkamagaluru
,
Bangalore
and
Kasaragod
districts
.


The
Christian
community
responded
to
the
attacks
within
hours
through
protests
.


The
protests
led
to
police
suppression
with
``
lathi
''
charges
and
tear
gas
,
making
around
150
arrests
and
injuring
30
to
40
people
.


The
incident
marked
the
first
time
that
Catholics
had
ever
resorted
to
violence
in
Mangalore
when
provoked
.


Between
15
September
and
10
October
,
a
new
wave
of
anti-minority
attacks
began
against
Christian
communities
in
the
Indian
states
of
Kerala
,
Madhya
Pradesh
,
Uttar
Pradesh
,
Andhra
Pradesh
,
Bihar
,
Chhattisgarh
,
Jharkhand
,
New
Delhi
,
Punjab
,
Tamil
Nadu
and
Uttarakhand
,
as
well
as
Muslim
communities
in
Gujarat
and
Maharashtra
.


the
september
2008
attacks
had
political
significance
,
given
that
the
ruling
bharatiya
janata
party
(
bjp
)
karnataka
state
government
,
led
by
b.
s.
yeddyurappa
,
were
also
accused
of
involvement
and
backing
the
anti-christian
campaigns
and
that
the
police
were
reported
to
have
had
knowledge
of
the
imminent
attacks
but
failed
to
prevent
them
.


The
police
were
criticised
for
their
reaction
to
the
protests
and
a
report
by
a
committee
of
human
rights
activists
set
up
in
the
aftermath
to
examine
the
causes
of
the
attacks
claimed
that
they
had
used
the
event
as
a
pretext
to
assault
the
community
,
rather
than
defend
it
.


Justice
B.
K.
Somasekhara
of
Karnataka
,
however
,
concluded
that
the
police
and
government
helped
maintain
order
and
were
not
responsible
for
the
attacks
.


In
response
to
the
alleged
forcible
conversions
of
involvement
,
the
Vishwa
Hindu
Parishad
(
VHP
)
gave
a
three-month
deadline
for
New
Life
Fellowship
Trust
(
NLFT
)
to
stop
all
conversion
activities
in
Mangalore
.


The
Roman
Catholic
Diocese
of
Mangalore
declared
that
it
would
distance
itself
from
the
New
Life
Fellowship
Trust
.


In
February
2011
,
retired
Justice
M.
F.
Saldanha
,
was
outspoken
against
the
protests
and
published
a
report
in
which
he
described
the
attacks
as
``
state-sponsored
terrorism
''
and
that
the
attacks
were
part
of
``
communal
forces
''
at
work
attacking
Christian
institutions
on
the
coastal
belt
of
India
.


The
report
and
continued
denial
by
the
state
government
of
being
implicated
in
the
attacks
led
to
more
than
100,000
Christians
representing
some
45
Christian
denominations
and
secular
organisations
leading
a
silent
march
in
Mangalore
on
21
February
.


Following
the
publications
of
the
reports
and
subsequent
protests
,
the
government
of
Karnataka
announced
that
it
would
drop
338
cases
against
Christians
who
had
protested
in
the
attack
,
and
in
December
2011
a
further
23
cases
against
Christians
were
dropped
.


The
Action
of
Arsuf
(
8
June
1918
)
,
was
fought
between
the
forces
of
the
British
Empire
and
the
Ottoman
Empire
,
German
Empire
and
Austria-Hungary
during
the
Sinai
and
Palestine
Campaign
of
the
First
World
War
.


The
British
Empire
forces
involved
was
the
21st
(
Bareilly
)
Brigade
comprising
the
2nd
Battalion
,
Black
Watch
,
the
1st
Guides
Infantry
,
the
29th
Punjabis
and
the
1/8th
Gurkha
Rifles
.


On
8
June
1918
the
21st
(
Bareilly
)
Brigade
,
part
of
the
7th
(
Meerut
)
Division
,
was
tasked
with
the
capture
of
two
hills
,
from
the
Mediterranean
Sea
known
as
the
two
sisters
,
defended
by
elements
of
the
Ottoman
7th
Division
.


The
hills
were
being
used
as
observation
posts
and
the
intention
was
to
deprive
the
Turkish
forces
of
their
use
.


The
successful
assault
was
carried
out
by
the
Black
Watch
and
the
Guides
Infantry
.


The
Turkish
forces
responded
with
two
counter-attacks
of
their
own
.


The
first
succeeded
in
recapturing
a
section
of
their
previous
position
before
being
driven
back
.


The
second
counter-attack
was
defeated
before
they
managed
to
reach
the
British
position
.


The
Turkish
forces
suffered
``
considerable
''
losses
,
and
four
officers
and
101
other
ranks
were
taken
prisoner
.


Equipment
captured
included
two
heavy
and
five
light
machine
guns
.


The
capture
of
the
two
Turkish
positions
greatly
improved
the
British
position
.


Their
loss
deprived
the
Turkish
forces
an
observation
post
that
overlooked
a
large
portion
of
the
British
lines
and
rear
areas
.


They
also
now
gave
the
British
their
own
observation
post
that
could
see
the
Turkish
rear
areas
.


There
capture
was
significant
enough
to
be
mentioned
in
army
despatches
.


The
Hoddle
Street
massacre
was
a
mass
shooting
that
occurred
on
the
evening
of
Sunday
,
9
August
1987
,
in
Hoddle
Street
,
Clifton
Hill
,
a
suburb
of
Melbourne
,
Victoria
,
in
Australia
.


The
shootings
resulted
in
the
deaths
of
seven
people
,
and
serious
injury
to
19
others
.


After
a
police
chase
lasting
more
than
30
minutes
,
19-year-old
former
Australian
Army
officer
cadet
Julian
Knight
was
caught
in
nearby
Fitzroy
North
and
arrested
for
the
shootings
.


Knight
was
later
sentenced
to
seven
concurrent
sentences
of
life
imprisonment
with
a
non-parole
period
of
27
years
for
what
was
described
by
the
presiding
judge
as
``
one
of
the
bloodiest
massacres
in
Australian
history
''
.


The
Crown
prosecutor
,
Joe
Dickson
QC
,
'did
not
contend
that
a
minimum
term
should
not
be
fixed
.
'


Knight
currently
resides
in
the
maximum
security
Port
Phillip
Prison
in
Truganina
,
Victoria
near
Melbourne
and
was
eligible
for
parole
in
2014
.


Shortly
before
Knight
became
eligible
for
parole
,
the
Victorian
government
amended
the
``
Corrections
Act
1986
''
(
Vic
)
to
prevent
the
parole
board
from
ordering
Knight
's
release
on
parole
'unless
satisfied
,
amongst
other
things
,
that
Mr
Knight
is
in
imminent
danger
of
dying
or
is
seriously
incapacitated
and
that
,
as
a
result
,
he
no
longer
has
the
physical
ability
to
do
harm
to
any
person
.

The
1984
Rajneeshee
bioterror
attack
was
the
food
poisoning
of
751
individuals
in
The
Dalles
,
Oregon
,
through
the
deliberate
contamination
of
salad
bars
at
ten
local
restaurants
with
``
Salmonella
''
.


A
group
of
prominent
followers
of
Bhagwan
Shree
Rajneesh
(
later
known
as
Osho
)
led
by
Ma
Anand
Sheela
had
hoped
to
incapacitate
the
voting
population
of
the
city
so
that
their
own
candidates
would
win
the
1984
Wasco
County
elections
.


The
incident
was
the
first
and
is
the
single
largest
bioterrorist
attack
in
United
States
history
.


Having
previously
gained
political
control
of
Antelope
,
Oregon
,
Rajneesh
's
followers
,
who
were
based
in
nearby
Rajneeshpuram
,
sought
election
to
two
of
the
three
seats
on
the
Wasco
County
Circuit
Court
that
were
up
for
election
in
November
1984
.


Fearing
they
would
not
gain
enough
votes
,
some
Rajneeshpuram
officials
decided
to
incapacitate
voters
in
The
Dalles
,
the
largest
population
center
in
Wasco
County
.


The
chosen
biological
agent
was
``
Salmonella
enterica
''
Typhimurium
,
which
was
first
delivered
through
glasses
of
water
to
two
County
Commissioners
and
then
,
on
a
larger
scale
,
at
salad
bars
and
in
salad
dressing
.


As
a
result
of
the
attack
,
751
people
contracted
salmonellosis
,
45
of
whom
were
hospitalized
,
but
none
died
.


although
an
initial
investigation
by
the
oregon
public
health
division
and
the
centers
for
disease
control
did
not
rule
out
deliberate
contamination
,
the
agents
and
contamination
were
only
confirmed
a
year
later
.


on
february
28
,
1985
,
congressman
james
h.
weaver
gave
a
speech
in
the
united
states
house
of
representatives
in
which
he
``
accused
the
rajneeshees
of
sprinkling
``
salmonella
''
culture
on
salad
bar
ingredients
in
eight
restaurants
''
.


At
a
press
conference
in
September
1985
,
Rajneesh
accused
several
of
his
followers
of
participation
in
this
and
other
crimes
,
including
an
aborted
plan
in
1985
to
assassinate
a
United
States
Attorney
,
and
he
asked
state
and
federal
authorities
to
investigate
.


oregon
attorney
general
david
b.
frohnmayer
set
up
an
interagency
task
force
,
composed
of
oregon
state
police
and
the
federal
bureau
of
investigation
,
and
executed
search
warrants
in
rajneeshpuram
.


A
sample
of
bacteria
matching
the
contaminant
that
had
sickened
the
town
residents
was
found
in
a
Rajneeshpuram
medical
laboratory
.


Two
leading
Rajneeshpuram
officials
were
convicted
on
charges
of
attempted
murder
and
served
29
months
of
20-year
sentences
in
a
minimum-security
federal
prison
.


The
Grover
Cleveland
Elementary
School
shooting
took
place
on
January
29
,
1979
,
at
a
public
elementary
school
in
San
Diego
,
California
,
United
States
.


The
principal
and
a
custodian
were
killed
;
eight
children
and
a
police
officer
were
injured
.


A
16-year-old
girl
,
Brenda
Spencer
,
who
lived
in
a
house
across
the
street
from
the
school
,
was
convicted
of
the
shootings
.


Charged
as
an
adult
,
she
pleaded
guilty
to
two
counts
of
murder
and
assault
with
a
deadly
weapon
,
and
was
given
an
indefinite
sentence
.


she
remains
in
prison
.


A
reporter
reached
Spencer
by
phone
while
she
was
still
in
the
house
after
the
shooting
,
and
asked
her
why
she
did
it
.


She
reportedly
answered
:
``
I
do
n't
like
Mondays
.


this
livens
up
the
day
,
''
which
inspired
bob
geldof
and

to
write
the
boomtown

song
``

''
.


The
Bayardo
Bar
attack
took
place
on
13
August
1975
in
Belfast
,
Northern
Ireland
.


A
unit
of
the
Provisional
Irish
Republican
Army
(
IRA
)
,
led
by
Brendan
McFarlane
,
launched
a
bombing
and
shooting
attack
on
a
pub
on
Aberdeen
Street
,
in
the
loyalist
Shankill
area
.


ira
members
claimed
the
pub
was
targeted
because
it
was
frequented
by
members
of
the
ulster
volunteer
force
(
uvf
)
.


Four
Protestant
civilians
and
one
UVF
member
were
killed
,
while
more
than
fifty
were
injured
.


According
to
journalists
Alan
Murray
and
Peter
Taylor
,
it
was
retaliation
for
the
Miami
Showband
massacre
almost
a
fortnight
earlier
,
when
the
popular
Dublin-based
band
were
shot
dead
by
the
UVF
at
a
fake
military
checkpoint
.


McFarlane
and
two
other
IRA
volunteers
,
Peter
``
Skeet
''
Hamilton
and
Seamus
Clarke
,
were
sentenced
to
life
imprisonment
for
perpetrating
the
Bayardo
attack
.

Radio
contact
with
``

''
was
lost
after
22:00
on
12
October
1974
,
apparently
as
the
aircraft
was
heading
into
the
typhoon
's
eye
to
make
a
second
position
fix
during
its
alpha
pattern
.


There
were
no
radio
transmissions
indicating

,
and
search

could
not
locate
the

Low
rainfall
across
winter
and
spring
2001
combined
with
a
hot
,
dry
December
created
ideal
conditions
for
bushfires
.


on
the
day
of
christmas
eve
,
firefighters
from
the
grose
vale
rural
fire
service
(
rfs
)
brigade
attended
a
blaze
in
rugged
terrain
at
the
end
of
cabbage
tree
rd
,
grose
vale
,
believed
to
have
been
caused
by
power
lines
in
the
grose
valley
.


On
Christmas
Day
,
strong
westerly
winds
fuelled
more
than
100
bushfires
across
the
state
,
creating
a
plume
of
smoke
that
extended
across
Sydney
.


This
plume
of
smoke
would
not
clear
for
some
days
as
the
bushfires
continued
to
burn
,
creating
some
of
the
worst
pollution
that
Sydney
has
ever
experienced
,
with
a
regional
pollution
index
reading
of
:
200
in
North-West
Sydney
;
120
in
Central-East
and
South-West
Sydney
.


The
fires
mainly
burnt
in
Lane
Cove
National
Park
,
the
Royal
National
Park
&
Blue
Mountains
National
Park
.


Overall
approximately
3,000
square
kilometres
(
740,000
acres
)
were
burnt
.


121
homes
were
destroyed
across
the
state
and
36
damaged
,
mostly
in
the
lower
Blue
Mountains
and
west
of
the
Royal
National
Park
around
Helensburgh
.


Arsonists
were
believed
to
be
responsible
for
starting
many
of
the
fires
,
leading
to
harsher
penalties
for
those
who
start
bushfires
.


The
dry
conditions
that
started
the
bushfires
continued
well
into
2002
,
resulting
in
the
worst
drought
in
100
years
.


The
drought
was
declared
a
``
one
in
1000
year
event
''
.


The
drought
finally
broke
with
the
La
Nina
event
of
2010–2011
.


Significantly
higher
than
average
rainfall
began
in
July
2010
,
it
was
Australia
's
second
wettest
year
on
record

Operation
Sonnenblume
(

was
the
name
given
to
the
dispatch
of
German
troops
to
North
Africa
in
February
1941
,
during
the
Second
World
War

of
the
new
``

``

departed
Naples
for
Africa
and
arrived
on
11
February
1941
.


(
In
the
English-speaking
world
,
the
term
``
Afrika
Korps
''
became
a
generic
title
for
German
forces
in
North
Africa
.
)


On
14
February
,
advanced
units
of
the
5th
Light
``
Afrika
''
Division
(
later
renamed
the
21st
Panzer

)
,
3
(

and
39
(
Tank
Hunter
Detachment
39
)
arrived
in
Tripoli
,
Libya
and
were
sent
immediately
to
the
front
line
at
Sirte
.


Rommel
arrived
in
Libya
on
12
February
,
with
orders
to
defend
Tripoli
and
Tripolitania
,
albeit
using
aggressive
tactics
.


General
Italo
Gariboldi
replaced
``
Maresciallo
d'Italia
''
(
Marshal
of
Italy
)
Rodolfo
Graziani
as
the
Governor-General
of
Libya
on
25
March
and
``
Generale
d'Armata
''
Mario
Roatta
,
Commander
in
Chief
of
the
``
Regio
Esercito
''
(
Royal
Italian
Army
)
,
ordered
Graziani
to
place
Italian
motorised
units
in
Libya
under
German
command
.


The
first
German
troops
reached
Sirte
on
15
February
and
advanced
to
Nofilia
on
18
February
.


On
24
February
,
a
German
raiding
party
ambushed
a
British
patrol
near
El
Agheila
.


On
24
March
,
the
Axis
captured
El
Agheila
and
on
31
March
attacked
Brega
.


The
understrength
3rd
Armoured
Brigade
failed
to
counter-attack
and
began
to
retreat
towards
Benghazi
the
next
day
.


Once
the
3rd
Armoured
Brigade
moved
,
its
worn-out
tanks
began
to
break
down
as
had
been
predicted
and
the
brigade
failed
to
prevent
Axis
flanking
moves
in
the
desert
,
south
of
the
Cyrenaican
bulge
,
which
left
Australian
infantry
in
Benghazi
no
option
but
to
retreat
up
the
``
Via
Balbia
''
.


Rommel
split
his
forces
into
small
columns
to
harry
the
British
retreat
,
as
far
as
the
Axis
fuel
and
water
shortage
permitted
.


A
considerable
British
force
was
captured
at
Mechili
,
which
led
to
the
British
retreat
continuing
to
Tobruk
and
then
to
the
Libyan–Egyptian
frontier
.


Axis
forces
failed
to
capture
Tobruk
before
the
defenders
had
time
to
prepare
its
defence
and
Rommel
then
had
to
divide
the
Axis
forces
between
Tobruk
and
the
frontier
.


``
Sonnenblume
''
succeeded
because
the
ability
of
the
Germans
to
mount
an
offensive
was
underestimated
by
General
Archbald
Wavell
,
the
Commander
in
Chief
Middle
East
,
the
War
Office
and
by
Winston
Churchill
.


Rommel
transformed
the
situation
by
his
audacity
,
which
was
unexpected
,
despite
copious
intelligence
reports
from
Ultra
and
MI
14
(
British
Military
Intelligence
)
.


Many
British
units
had
been
transferred
to
Greece
and
others
to
Egypt
to
refit
.


Some
commanders
appointed
by
Wavell
to
Cyrenaica
Command
(
CYRCOM
)
proved
incompetent
and
Wavell
relied
on
maps
found
to
be
inaccurate
,
when
he
later
arrived
to
see
for
himself
.


In
1949
,
Wavell
wrote
``
I
had
certainly
not
budgeted
for
Rommel
after
my
experience
of
the
Italians
.


I
should
have
been
more
prudent
...
''


The
Battle
of
the
Kamenets-Podolsky
pocket
(
or
Hube
Pocket
)
was
part
of
the
larger
Soviet
Proskurov–Chernovitsy
Offensive
,
whose
main
goal
was
to
envelop
the
Wehrmacht
's
1st
Panzer
Army
of
Army
Group
South
.


The
envelopment
occurred
in
late
March
1944
on
the
Eastern
Front
during
the
Dnieper-Carpathian
Offensive
.


It
was
the
biggest
and
most
important
operation
of
the
Dnieper-Carpathian
Offensive
.


The
Red
Army
successfully
created
a
pocket
,
trapping
some
220,000
German
soldiers
inside
.


Under
the
command
of
General
Hans-Valentin
Hube
and
with
the
direction
of
Field
Marshal
Erich
von
Manstein
,
the
majority
of
German
forces
in
the
pocket
were
able
to
fight
their
way
out
by
mid-April
in
coordination
with
the
German
relief
forces
led
by
the
2nd
SS
Panzer
Corps
,
which
was
transferred
from
France
with
just
months
before
the
Allied
D-Day
landings
.


although
the
majority
of
the
1st
panzer
army
was
rescued
,
it
came
at
the
cost
of
losing
almost
the
entire
heavy
equipment
and
a
significant
territory
while
many
divisions
ended
up
being
shattered
formations
,
which
required
thorough
refitting
.


This
Soviet
offensive
and
the
ongoing
crisis
had
absorbed
all
German
strategic
reserves
that
could
otherwise
be
used
to
repel
the
future
Allied
D-Day
landings
or
Soviet
Operation
Bagration
.


All
told
,
9
infantry
and
2
panzer
divisions
,
1
heavy
panzer
battalion
and
2
assault
gun
brigades
with
a
total
strength
of
127,496
troops
and
363
tanks/assault
guns
were
transferred
from
across
France
,
Germany
,
Denmark
,
Poland
,
Balkans
to
the
Ukraine
between
March-April
1944
.


In
total
,
the
German
forces
stationed
in
France
were
deprived
of
a
total
of
45,827
troops
and
363
tanks
,
assault
guns
,
and
self-propelled
anti-tank
guns
on
6
June
1944
.


although
the
soviets
were
unable
to
destroy
the
1st
panzer
army
,
they
did
achieve
major
operational
goals
.


With
the
Soviet
1st
Tank
Army
crossing
the
Dniester
river
and
reaching
Chernovtsy
near
the
Carpathian
Mountains
,
the
1st
Panzer
Army
's
links
with
the
8th
Army
in
the
south
had
been
cut
off
.


As
a
result
,
Army
Group
South
was
effectively
split
into
two-
north
and
south
of
Carpathians
.


The
northern
portion
was
renamed
to
Army
Group
North
Ukraine
,
while
the
southern
portion
to
Army
Group
South
Ukraine
,
which
was
effective
from
5
April
1944
,
although
very
little
of
Ukraine
remained
in
German
hands
.


For
the
Wehrmacht
defeat
,
the
commander
of
Army
Group
South
Erich
von
Manstein
was
dismissed
by
Hitler
and
replaced
by
Walther
Model
.


As
a
result
of
this
split
,
the
Soviets
had
cut
the
main
supply
lifeline
of
Army
Group
South-
the
Lvov-Odessa
railway
.


Now
,
the
southern
group
of
German
forces
would
have
to
use
the
long
roundabout
route
through
the
Balkans
,
with
all
of
the
supplies
being
rerouted
over
the
Romanian
railroads
,
which
were
in
poor
condition
.


Israel
's
tourism
minister
Rehavam
Ze'evi
was
assassinated
shortly
before
7
am
(
GMT+2
)
on
Wednesday
,
17
October
2001
at
the
former
Hyatt
Hotel
in
Jerusalem
by
a
squad
of
Palestinians
acting
on
behalf
of
the
Popular
Front
for
the
Liberation
of
Palestine
militant
organization
.


Ze'evi
was
the
first
Israeli
minister
to
be
assassinated
since
the
assassination
of
Yitzhak
Rabin
and
the
most
senior
Israeli
person
to
be
killed
by
Palestinian
militants
during
the
entire
Arab–Israeli
conflict
.


Ze'evi
's
assassins
fled
the
scene
and
hid
for
a
time
in
the
Mukataa
compound
in
Ramallah
under
the
auspices
of
Yasser
Arafat
.


An
agreement
was
eventually
reached
during
Operation
Defensive
Shield
,
in
which
Israeli
forces
besieged
the
Mukataa
compound
.


Ze'evi
's
assassins
were
transferred
to
the
Jericho
prison
under
the
supervision
of
British
and
American
guards
.


The
Islamist
militant
organization
Hamas
won
the
Palestinian
legislative
elections
in
January
2006
,
and
Hamas
leader
Ismail
Haniyeh
publicly
announced
his
intention
to
free
Ze'evi
's
assassin
squad
members
.


On
14
March
2006
,
the
American
and
British
guards
left
the
Jericho
jail
,
charging
that
the
Palestinian
Authority
was
not
sticking
to
the
agreement
reached
with
Israel
four
years
earlier
.


As
a
result
,
Israel
launched
Operation
Bringing
Home
the
Goods
on
the
same
day
in
which
the
IDF
captured
Ze'evi
's
assassins
;
they
were
tried
in
Israel
,
convicted
,
and
given
long
prison
terms
.


The
1933
Texas
tropical
storm
produced
record
rainfall
in
the
south-central
United
States
in
July
of
the
1933
Atlantic
hurricane
season
.


It
was
the
third
storm
of
the
season
,
developing
on
July
14
near
the
Lesser
Antilles
.


While
moving
westward
through
the
Caribbean
Sea
,
the
cyclone
passed
just
south
of
Jamaica
on
July
16
.


The
storm
dropped
heavy
rainfall
on
the
island
that
caused
flooding
and
road
washouts
.


On
July
18
,
the
storm
struck
Belize
and
later
moved
across
the
Yucatán
Peninsula
.


Initially
it
was
believed
that
the
storm
continued
into
Mexico
and
dissipated
while
another
storm
formed
to
its
northeast
,
but
it
was
discovered
in
2012
that
the
storm
followed
one
continuous
track
.


On
July
23
,
the
storm
struck
southeastern
Texas
at
its
peak
intensity
of
50
mph
(
85
km/h
)
.


It
moved
inland
and
transitioned
into
an
extratropical
cyclone
.


Turning
eastward
,
the
storm
dropped
torrential
rainfall
in
eastern
Texas
and
western
Louisiana
,
peaking
at
in
Logansport
,
Louisiana
.


Several
stations
reported
record
rainfall
,
including
Shreveport
,
Louisiana
where
its
24‑hour
amount
remained
the
highest
daily
total
as
of
2008
.


High
rains
left
about
$
1.5
million
in
crop
damage
between
two
Texas
counties
.


The
rains
caused
rivers
to
exceed
their
banks
,
forcing
evacuations
and
road
closures
.


Operation
Biting
,
also
known
as
the
Bruneval
Raid
,
was
a
British
Combined
Operations
raid
on
a
German
coastal
radar
installation
at
Bruneval
in
northern
France
during
the
Second
World
War
,
on
the
night
.


several
of
these
installations
were
identified
from
royal
air
force
(
raf
)
aerial
reconnaissance
photographs
during
1941
,
but
their
exact
purpose
and
the
nature
of
the
equipment
that
they
possessed
was
not
known
.


Some
British
scientists
believed
that
these
stations
were
connected
with
the
heavy
losses
being
experienced
by
RAF
bombers
conducting
bombing
raids
against
targets
in
Occupied
Europe
.


The
scientists
requested
that
one
of
these
installations
be
raided
and
the
technology
it
possessed
be
studied
and
,
if
possible
,
extracted
and
brought
back
to
Britain
for
further
examination
.


Due
to
the
extensive
coastal
defences
erected
by
the
Germans
to
protect
the
installation
from
a
seaborne
raid
,
it
was
believed
that
a
commando
raid
from
the
sea
would
suffer
heavy
losses
and
give
sufficient
time
for
the
enemy
to
destroy
the
installation
.


It
was
therefore
decided
that
an
airborne
assault
followed
by
seaborne
evacuation
would
be
the
most
practicable
way
to
surprise
the
garrison
of
the
installation
,
seize
the
technology
intact
,
and
minimise
casualties
to
the
raiding
force
.


On
the
night
of
27
February
,
after
a
period
of
intense
training
and
several
delays
due
to
poor
weather
,
a
company
of
airborne
troops
under
the
command
of
Major
John
Frost
parachuted
into
France
a
few
miles
from
the
installation
.


The
main
force
then
assaulted
the
villa
in
which
the
radar
equipment
was
kept
,
killing
several
members
of
the
German
garrison
and
capturing
the
installation
after
a
brief
firefight
.


An
RAF
technician
with
the
force
dismantled
a
Würzburg
radar
array
and
removed
several
key
pieces
,
after
which
the
force
withdrew
to
the
evacuation
beach
.


The
detachment
assigned
to
clear
the
beach
had
initially
failed
to
do
so
,
but
the
German
force
guarding
it
was
soon
eliminated
with
the
help
of
the
main
force
.


The
raiding
troops
were
picked
up
by
landing
craft
,
then
transferred
to
several
Motor
Gun
Boats
which
returned
them
to
Britain
.


The
raid
was
entirely
successful
.


The
airborne
troops
suffered
relatively
few
casualties
,
and
the
pieces
of
the
radar
they
brought
back
,
along
with
a
captured
German
radar
technician
,
allowed
British
scientists
to
understand
enemy
advances
in
radar
and
to
create
countermeasures
to
neutralise
them
.


The
Second
Battle
of
the
Aisne
(
or
,
16
April
–
mid-May
1917
)
was
the
main
part
of
the
Nivelle
Offensive
,
a
Franco-British
attempt
to
inflict
a
decisive
defeat
on
the
German
armies
in
France
.


The
Entente
strategy
was
to
conduct
offensives
from
north
to
south
,
beginning
with
an
attack
by
the
British
Expeditionary
Force
(
BEF
)
then
the
main
attack
by
two
French
army
groups
on
the
Aisne
.


General
Robert
Nivelle
planned
the
offensive
in
December
1916
,
after
he
replaced
Joseph
Joffre
as
Commander-in-Chief
of
the
French
Army
.


The
objective
of
the
attack
on
the
Aisne
was
to
capture
the
prominent
,
east–west
ridge
of
the
Chemin
des
Dames
,
north-east
of
Paris
and
then
advance
northwards
to
capture
the
city
of
Laon
.


When
the
French
armies
met
the
British
advancing
from
the
Arras
front
,
the
Germans
would
be
pursued
towards
Belgium
and
the
German
frontier
.


The
offensive
began
on
9
April
,
when
the
British
began
the
Battle
of
Arras
.


On
16
April
,
the
(
GAR
,
Reserve
Army
Group
)
attacked
the
Chemin
des
Dames
and
the
next
day
,
the
Fourth
Army
,
part
of
(
GAC
,
Central
Army
Group
)
,
near
Reims
to
the
south-east
,
began
the
Battle
of
the
Hills
.


The
Chemin
des
Dames
ridge
had
been
quarried
for
stone
for
centuries
,
leaving
a
warren
of
caves
and
tunnels
which
were
used
as
shelters
by
German
troops
to
escape
the
French
bombardment
.


The
offensive
met
massed
German
machine-gun
and
artillery
fire
,
which
inflicted
many
casualties
and
repulsed
the
French
infantry
at
many
points
.


The
French
achieved
a
substantial
tactical
success
and
took
but
failed
to
defeat
decisively
the
German
armies
.


The
failure
had
a
traumatic
effect
on
the
morale
of
the
French
army
and
many
divisions
mutinied
.


Nivelle
was
superseded
by
General
Philippe
Pétain
,
who
adopted
a
strategy
of
``
healing
and
defence
''
,
to
resume
the
wearing-out
of
the
German
Army
while
conserving
French
infantry
.


Pétain
began
a
substantial
programme
re-equipment
of
the
French
Army
,
had
shot
as
scapegoats
and
provided
better
food
,
more
pay
and
more
leave
,
which
led
to
a
considerable
improvement
in
morale
.


The
new
French
strategy
was
not
one
of
passive
defence
;
in
June
and
July
the
Fourth
,
Sixth
and
Tenth
Armies
conducted
several
limited
attacks
and
the
First
Army
was
sent
to
Flanders
to
participate
in
the
Third
Battle
of
Ypres
.


The
British
prolonged
the
Arras
offensive
into
mid-May
,
despite
uncertainty
about
French
intentions
,
high
losses
and
diminishing
returns
,
as
divisions
were
transferred
northwards
to
Flanders
.


The
British
captured
Messines
Ridge
on
7
June
and
spent
the
rest
of
the
year
on
the
offensive
in
the
Third
Battle
of
Ypres
(
)
and
the
Battle
of
Cambrai
(
)
.


The
mutinies
in
the
French
armies
became
known
in
general
to
the
Germans
but
the
cost
of
the
defensive
success
on
the
Aisne
made
it
impossible
to
reinforce
Flanders
and
conduct
more
than
local
operations
on
the
Aisne
and
in
Champagne
.


A
French
attack
at
Verdun
in
August
recaptured
much
of
the
ground
lost
in
1916
and
in
the
Battle
of
La
Malmaison
in
October
captured
the
west
end
of
the
Chemin
des
Dames
and
forced
the
Germans
to
withdraw
to
the
north
bank
of
the
Ailette
.

The
Central
Park
jogger
case
was
a
criminal
case
in
the
United
States
based
on
the
assault
and
rape
of
Trisha
Meili
,
a
28-year-old
white
woman
who
was
jogging
in
the
park
,
and
attacks
on
eight
other
persons
,
in
areas
ranging
from
the
North
Woods
of
Manhattan
's
Central
Park
to
the
Reservoir
,
on
the
night
of
April
19
,
1989
.


Three
of
the
victims
were
black
or
Latino
.


Meili
was
so
injured
that
she
was
in
a
coma
for
12
days
.


``
The
New
York
Times
''
in
1990
described
the
attack
on
her
as
``
one
of
the
most
widely
publicized
crimes
of
the
1980s
''
.


Attacks
in
Central
Park
that
night
were
allegedly
committed
by
a
loose
group
of
30–32
teenagers
,
and
police
attempted
to
apprehend
suspects
after
crimes
began
to
be
reported
between
9
and
10
p.m
.


The
brutally
beaten
Meili
was
not
found
until
1:30
a.m.
,
after
which
the
police
hunt
greatly
intensified
.


They
took
into
custody
14
or
more
other
suspects
over
the
next
few
days
,
and
arrested
a
total
of
ten
suspects
who
were
ultimately
tried
for
the
attacks
.


Among
them
were
four
African
American
and
two
Hispanic
American
teenagers
who
were
indicted
on
May
10
on
charges
of
assault
,
robbery
,
riot
,
rape
,
sexual
abuse
,
and
attempted
murder
of
Meili
and
an
unrelated
man
,
John
Loughlin
.


The
prosecutor
planned
to
try
the
defendants
in
two
groups
,
then
scheduled
the
sixth
defendant
to
be
tried
last
.


The
latter
pleaded
guilty
in
January
1991
on
lesser
charges
and
received
a
reduced
sentence
.


Prosecution
of
the
five
remaining
defendants
in
the
rape
and
assault
case
was
based
primarily
on
confessions
which
they
had
made
after
police
interrogations
.


None
had
counsel
during
this
questioning
.


Within
weeks
,
they
each
withdrew
these
confessions
,
pleaded
not
guilty
,
and
refused
plea
deals
on
the
rape
and
assault
charges
.


None
of
the
suspects
'
DNA
matched
the
DNA
collected
from
the
crime
scene
:
two
semen
samples
that
both
belonged
to
one
unidentified
man
.


No
substantive
physical
evidence
connected
any
of
the
five
teenagers
to
the
rape
scene
,
but
each
was
convicted
in
1990
of
related
assault
and
other
charges
.


Subsequently
known
as
the
Central
Park
Five
,
they
received
stiff
sentences
ranging
from
5
to
15
years
.


Four
of
the
defendants
appealed
their
convictions
,
but
these
were
affirmed
by
appellate
courts
.


The
four
juvenile
defendants
served
6–7
years
each
;
the
16-year-old
,
tried
and
sentenced
as
an
adult
,
served
13
years
in
adult
prison
.


The
five
other
defendants
,
indicted
for
assaults
of
other
victims
,
pleaded
guilty
to
reduced
charges
and
received
less
severe
sentences
.


In
2001
,
Matias
Reyes
,
a
convicted
murderer
and
serial
rapist
serving
life
in
prison
,
confessed
to
officials
that
he
had
raped
the
female
jogger
.


His
DNA
matched
that
found
at
the
scene
,
and
he
provided
other
confirmatory
evidence
.


He
said
he
committed
the
rape
alone
.


Reyes
could
not
be
prosecuted
for
raping
Meili
,
because
the
statute
of
limitations
had
passed
.


In
2002
Robert
Morgenthau
,
District
Attorney
for
New
York
County
,
had
his
office
conduct
an
investigation
and
recommended
to
the
state
court
that
the
convictions
of
the
five
men
on
all
charges
be
vacated
.


The
court
vacated
their
convictions
in
2002
,
and
the
state
withdrew
all
charges
against
the
men
.


In
2003
,
the
five
men
sued
the
City
of
New
York
for
malicious
prosecution
,
racial
discrimination
,
and
emotional
distress
.


The
city
refused
to
settle
the
suits
for
a
decade
,
because
its
lawyers
believed
that
the
city
could
win
a
court
case
.


After
a
change
in
administration
,
the
city
settled
in
2014
with
the
five
plaintiffs
for
$
41
million
.


The
five
men
also
filed
suit
against
the
State
of
New
York
for
additional
damages
;
this
case
was
settled
in
2016
for
a
total
of
$
3.9
million
.


Lalith
Athulathmudali
,
the
former
Cabinet
Minister
of
Trade
,
National
Security
,
Agriculture
,
Education
and
Deputy
Minister
of
Defence
of
Sri
Lanka
was
killed
at
8:10
p.m.
Sri
Lanka
Time
(
2.10
p.m.
UTC
)
on
23
April
1993
in
Kirulapana
.


Athulathmudali
was
fatally
shot
while
addressing
a
gathering
,
approximately
4
weeks
ahead
of
the
Provincial
Council
elections
for
the
Western
Province
,
May
1993
.


The
investigation
carried
out
by
Sri
Lanka
Police
and
Scotland
Yard
separately
concluded
that
the
assassination
was
carried
out
by
a
Tamil
youth
named
Appiah
Balakrishnan
``
alias
''
Ragunathan
,
who
was
affiliated
to
LTTE
.


However
these
findings
were
widely
disputed
by
people
due
to
the
political
context
of
that
time
.


In
1995
,
President
Chandrika
Bandaranaike
Kumaratunga
appointed
a
presidential
commission
to
probe
the
Athulathmudali
assassination
,
which
had
been
an
election
promise
of
her
1994
presidential
election
campaign
.


The
final
commission
report
submitted
on
October
7
,
1997
pointed
the
finger
at
former
President
Ranasinghe
Premadasa
(
1988–93
)
and
security
force
personnel
who
were
close
to
him
as
directly
responsible
for
the
killing
of
Athulathmudali
.


Subsequently
,
a
few
security
force
members
and
underworld
figures
were
arrested
.


They
were
eventually
charged
with
conspiracy
,
aiding
and
abetting
to
commit
murder
.


Three
of
the
accused
were
killed
during
prosecution
,
raising
further
questions
about
the
assassination
.


The
Lalith
Athulathmudali
case
remains
the
most
controversial
political
assassination
in
recent
Sri
Lankan
history
.


National
Airlines
Flight
2511
was
a
domestic
passenger
flight
from
New

,
New

,
Florida
that

.


The
National

Douglas
DC-6
was
carrying
5
crew
members
and
29
passengers
,
all
of
whom
perished
.


The
Civil
Aeronautics
Board
investigation
concluded
that
the
plane
was
brought
down
by
a
bomb
made
of
dynamite
.


No
criminal
charges
were
ever
filed
,
nor
was
the
blame
for
the
bombing
ever
determined
,
though
a
suicide
bombing
is
suspected
.


The
investigation
remains
open
today
.


One
of
the
victims
was
retired

The
Naroda
Patiya
massacre
took
place
on
28
February
2002
at
Naroda
,
in
Ahmedabad
,
India
,
during
the
2002
Gujarat
riots
.


97
muslims
were
killed
by
a
mob
of
approximately
5,000
people
,
organised
by
the
bajrang
dal
,
a
wing
of
the
vishva
hindu
parishad
,
and
supported
by
the
bharatiya
janata
party
which
was
in
power
in
the
gujarat
state
government
.


The
massacre
at
Naroda
occurred
during
the
bandh
(
strike
)
called
by
Vishwa
Hindu
Parishad
a
day
after
the
Godhra
train
burning
.


The
riot
lasted
over
10
hours
,
during
which
the
mob
looted
,
stabbed
,
sexually
assaulted
,
gang-raped
and
burnt
people
individually
and
in
groups
.


After
the
conflict
,
a
curfew
was
imposed
in
the
state
and
army
troops
were
called
in
to
contain
further
violence
.


The
communal
violence
at
Naroda
was
deemed
``
the
largest
single
case
of
mass
murder
''
during
the
2002
Gujarat
riots
;
it
accounted
for
the
greatest
number
of
deaths
during
a
single
event
.


Survivors
faced
socio-economic
problems
;
many
were
left
homeless

and
injured
.


A
number
of
shrines
were
destroyed
and
many
schools
were
adversely
affected
,
cancelled
exams
or
closed
entirely
.


The
surviving
victims
were
given
shelter
in
relief
camps
provided
by
both
the
state
and
central
government
,
and
efforts
were
begun
to
restore
destroyed
properties
and
shrines
.


The
state
government
formed
a
``
Gujarat
state
commission
of
inquiry
''
for
citizens
to
have
a
forum
in
which
to
make
recommendations
and
suggest
reforms
.


Mainstream
media
criticised
the
Gujarat
government
's
handling
of
the
riots
;
it
was
remarked
that
a
number
of
reports
were
exaggerated
,
and
``
inflammatory
headlines
,
stories
and
pictures
''
were
published
,
resulting
in
anti-Muslim
prejudice
among
the
Hindu
readership
.


Allegations
were
made
against
the
state
police
,
state
government
and
the
chief
minister
Narendra
Modi
,
citing
that
government
authorities
were
involved
and
various
police
personnel
played
a
role
in
the
massacre
:
a
number
of
eyewitnesses
reported
police
officers
favouring
the
mob
by
allegedly
injuring
or
killing
Muslims
and
damaging
public
and
private
property
.


However
,
none
of
the
allegations
were
proven
and
the
government
and
police
were
cleared
of
wrongdoing
by
a
Special
Investigation
Team
.


The
initial
report
on
the
case
was
filed
by
the
Gujarat
police
,
accusing
46
people
,
all
of
whom
the
Special
Court
deemed
unreliable
.


In
2008
,
the
Supreme
Court
of
India
formed
a
Special
Investigation
Team
to
investigate
the
case
.


In
2009
,
the
team
submitted
its
report
,
which
accused
70
people
of
wrongdoing
,
61
of
whom
were
charged
.


On
29
August
2012
,
the
Special
Court
convicted
32
people
and
acquitted
29
due
to
insufficient
evidence

Fourmile
Canyon
or
Four
Mile
Canyon
is
a
mountainous
canyon
in
western
Boulder
County
,
Colorado
that
channels
a
stream
known
as
``
Fourmile

''
,
or
``

The
stream
rises
at

,
before
flowing
east
and
south
through
the
unincorporated
communities
of

to
the
confluence
with
Boulder

The
Bonus
Army
were
the
43,000
marchers—17,000
U.S.
World
War
I
veterans
,
their
families
,
and
affiliated
groups—who
gathered
in
Washington
,
D.C.
in
mid-1932
to
demand
cash-payment
redemption
of
their
service
certificates
.


Organizers
called
the
demonstrators
the
``
Bonus
Expeditionary
Force
''
,
to
echo
the
name
of
World
War
I
's
American
Expeditionary
Forces
,
while
the
media
referred
to
them
as
the
``
Bonus
Army
''
or
``
Bonus
Marchers
''
.


The
contingent
was
led
by
Walter
W.
Waters
,
a
former
sergeant
.


Many
of
the
war
veterans
had
been
out
of
work
since
the
beginning
of
the
Great
Depression
.


The
World
War
Adjusted
Compensation
Act
of
1924
had
awarded
them
bonuses
in
the
form
of
certificates
they
could
not
redeem
until
1945
.


Each
certificate
,
issued
to
a
qualified
veteran
soldier
,
bore
a
face
value
equal
to
the
soldier
's
promised
payment

interest
.


The
principal
demand
of
the
Bonus
Army
was
the
immediate
cash
payment
of
their
certificates
.


On
July
28
,
U.S.
Attorney
General
William
D.
Mitchell
ordered
the
veterans
removed
from
all
government
property
.


Washington
police
met
with
resistance
,
shots
were
fired
,
and
two
veterans
were
wounded
and
later
died
.


President

group
accepted
.


Those
who
chose
not
to
work
for
the

May
22
deadline
were
given
transportation
home
.


In

veto
and
paid
the
veterans
their
bonus
nine
years
early

Hurricane
Chantal
was
one
of
three
tropical
cyclones
to
make
landfall
in
Texas
during
the
1989
Atlantic
hurricane
season
.


The
third
named
storm
and
the
first
hurricane
of
the
season
,
Chantal
slowly
developed
on
July
30
in
the
southern
Gulf
of
Mexico
from
a
tropical
disturbance
that
was
previously
within
Intertropical
Convergence
Zone
(
ITCZ
)
while
near
Trinidad
and
Tobago
.


while
heading
north-northwestward
,
the
depression
steadily
intensified
and
was
upgraded
to
tropical
storm
chantal
on
the
following
day
.


Thereafter
,
Chantal
quickly
strengthen
and
became
a
hurricane
on
August
1
.


After
intensifying
slightly
further
,
Chantal
made
landfall
near
High
Island
,
Texas
later
that
day
.


The
storm
quickly
weakened
upon
moving
inland
and
fell
to
tropical
storm
intensity
a
few
hours
after
landfall
.


Early
on
August
2
,
Chantal
weakened
to
a
tropical
depression
and
dissipated
over
Oklahoma
by
August
4
.


While
making
landfall
in
Texas
,
the
storm
produced
relatively
small
tides
,
with
most
locations
reporting
waves
less
than
in
height
.


However
,
some
locations
experienced
extensive
beach
erosion
.


In
addition
,
there
were
numerous
rescues
made
by
the
U.S.
Coast
Guard
.


Due
to
both
rainfall
and
high
winds
at
least
3,000
homes
were
damaged
,
and
numerous
trees
and
sign
were
knocked
down
.


Two
tornadoes
were
reported
,
with
one
causing
the
destruction
of
a
shed
in
Crystal
Beach
,
Texas
,
and
the
other
knocking
over
several
trees
and
mobile
homes
in
Iota
,
Louisiana
.


Elsewhere
,
Chantal
and
its
remnants
brought
light
to
moderate
rainfall
to
several
other
states
,
although
affects
were
minor
in
other
states
.


Overall
,
13
fatalities
occurred
,
all
of
which
due
to
drowning
,
and
at
least
$
100
million
(
1989
USD
)
in
damage
was
reported
.


Heavy
rainfall
was
the
main
cause
of
the
2011
Sindh
floods
.


The
area
saw
the
highest-ever
recorded
rainfall
between
August
11
,
2011
,
and
September
14
,
2011
.


After
September
15
,
2011
,
water
receded
from
the
inundated
area
at
the
rate
of
167
square
kilometers
a
day
.


The
floods
caused
considerable
damage
.


An
estimated
434
civilians
were
killed
while
5.3
million
people
and
1,524,773
homes
were
affected
.


Sindh
is
a
fertile
region
and
often
called
the
``
breadbasket
''
of
the
country
due
to
its
agricultural
output
.


The
impact
of
the
2011
flood
on
the
local
agrarian
economy
was
substantial
.


at
least
1.7
million
acres
of
arable
land
was
inundated
as
a
result
of
the
flooding
.


The
flooding
followed
the
previous
year
's
historic
2010
Pakistan
floods
,
which
devastated
the
entire
country
.


Unprecedented
,
torrential
monsoon
rains
caused
severe
flooding
in
16
districts
of
the
Sindh
province
.


The
``
Chesapeake
''
Affair
was
an
international
diplomatic
incident
that
occurred
during
the
American
Civil
War
.


on
december
7
,
1863
,
confederate
sympathizers
from
the
maritime
provinces
captured
the
american
steamer
``
chesapeake
''
off
the
coast
of
cape
cod
.


The
expedition
was
planned
and
led
by
Vernon
Guyon
Locke
(
1827–1890
)
of
Nova
Scotia
and
John
Clibbon
Brain
(
1840–1906
)
.


George
Wade
of
New
Brunswick
killed
one
of
the
American
crew
.


The
Confederacy
had
claimed
its
first
fatal
casualty
in
New
England
waters
.


The
Confederate
sympathizers
had
planned
to
re-coal
at
Saint
John
,
New
Brunswick
,
and
then
head
south
to
Wilmington
,
North
Carolina
.


Instead
,
the
captors
experienced
difficulties
at
Saint
John
,
which
required
them
to
move
further
east
and
re-coal
in
Halifax
,
Nova
Scotia
.


U.S.
forces
violated
British
sovereignty
by
trying
to
arrest
the
captors
in
Nova
Scotian
waters
,
which
further
escalated
the
affair
.


Wade
and
others
were
able
to
escape
through
the
assistance
of
prominent
Nova
Scotian
and
Confederate
sympathizer
William
Johnston
Almon
.


The
``
Chesapeake
''
Affair
was
one
of
the
most
sensational
international
incidents
that
occurred
during

.


The
incident
briefly
threatened
to
bring
the
British
Empire
into
the
war
against
the
North
.


The
German
Autumn
(
)
was
a
series
of
events
in
Germany
in
late
1977
associated
with
the
kidnapping
and
murder
of
industrialist
Hanns
Martin

The
assassination
of
Siegfried
Buback
,
the
attorney-general
of
West
Germany
on
7
April
1977
,
and
the
failed

in
their
prison
cells
,
and
the

The
phrase
``
German
Autumn

Between
2011
and
2017
,
fighting
from
the
Syrian
Civil
War
spilled
over
into
Lebanon
as
opponents
and
supporters
of
the
Syrian
Arab
Republic
travelled
to
Lebanon
to
fight
and
attack
each
other
on
Lebanese
soil
.


The
Syrian
conflict
stoked
a
resurgence
of
sectarian
violence
in
Lebanon
,
with
many
of
Lebanon
's
Sunni
Muslims
supporting
the
rebels
in
Syria
,
while
many
of
Lebanon
's
Shi
'
a
Muslims
supporting
the
Syrian
government
which
is
led
by
Bashar
Al-Assad
,
whose
Alawite
minority
is
usually
described
as
an
offshoot
of
Shi
'
a
Islam
.


Killings
,
unrest
and
kidnappings
of
foreign
citizens
across
Lebanon
resulted
.


In
mid-2011
,
seven
people
were
killed
and
59
wounded
in
a
fight
between
gunmen
in
Tripoli
.


in
may
2012
,
the
conflict
spread
to
beirut
,
and
later
to
south
and
east
lebanon
,
while
the
lebanese
armed
forces
deployed
in
north
lebanon
and
beirut
.


As
of
January
2016
,
there
have
been
more
than
800
fatalities
and
almost
3,000
injuries
.


Among
Lebanon
's
political
blocs
,
the
Saudi-backed
anti-Syrian
March
14
Alliance
supports
the
Syrian
rebels
,
and
the
Iranian-backed
pro-Syrian
March
8
Alliance
supports
the
Syrian
government
.


On
28
August
2017
,
the
last
ISIL
and
Tahrir
al-Sham
remnants
withdrew
from
Lebanon
,
ending
the
Syrian
Civil
War
spillover
in
Lebanon
.


The
Arauco
War
was
a
long-running
conflict
between
colonial
Spaniards
and
the
Mapuche
people
,
mostly
fought
in
the
Araucanía
.


The
conflict
begun
at
first
as
a
reaction
to
the
Spanish
conquest
attempt
establishing
cities
and
forcing
Mapuches
into
servitude
.


It
subsequently
evolved
over
time
into
phases
of
low
intensity
warfare
,
drawn-out
sieges
,
slave-hunting
expeditions
,
pillaging
raids
,
punitive
expeditions
and
renewed
Spanish
attempts
to
secure
lost
territories
.


Abduction
of
women
and
war
rape
was
common
on
both
sides
.


After
many
initial
Spanish
successes
in
penetrating
Mapuche
territory
,
the
Battle
of
Curalaba
in
1598
and
the
following
destruction
of
the
Seven
Cities
marked
a
turning
point
in
the
war
leading
to
the
establishment
of
a
clear
frontier
between
the
Spanish
domains
and
the
land
of
the
independent
Mapuche
.


From
the
17th
to
the
late
18th
century
a
series
of
parliaments
were
held
between
royal
governors
and
Mapuche
lonkos
and
the
war
devolved
to
sporadic
pillaging
carried
out
by
Spanish
soldiers
as
well
as
Mapuches
and
outlaws
.


The
Chilean
War
of
Independence
brought
new
hostilities
to
the
frontier
,
with
different
factions
of
Spaniards
,
Chileans
and
Mapuches
fighting
for
independence
,
royalism
or
personal
gain
.


Mapuche
independence
finally
ended
with
the
Chilean
occupation
of
Araucanía
between
1861
and
1883
.


The
modern
Mapuche
conflict
is
partially
inspired
by
the
Arauco
War
.


The
current
conflict
in
the
Niger
Delta
first
arose
in
the
early
1990s
over
tensions
between
foreign
oil
corporations
and
a
number
of
the
Niger
Delta
's
minority
ethnic
groups
who
feel
they
are
being
exploited
,
particularly
the
Ogoni
and
the
Ijaw
.


Ethnic
and
political
unrest
has
continued
throughout
the
1990s
despite
the
conversion
to

Competition
for
oil
wealth
has
fueled
violence
between
ethnic
groups
,
causing
the
militarization
of
nearly
the
entire
region
by
ethnic
militia
groups
,
Nigerian
military
and
police
forces
,
notably
the
Nigerian
Mobile
Police
.


The
violence
has
contributed
to
Nigeria
's
ongoing
energy
supply
crisis
by
discouraging
foreign
investment
in
new
power
generation
plants
in
the
region
.


From
2004
on
,
violence
also
hit
the
oil
industry
with
piracy
and
kidnappings
.


In
2009
,
a
presidential
amnesty
program
accompanied
with
support
and
training
of
ex-militants
proved
to
be
a
success
.


Thus
until
2011
,
victims
of
crimes
were
fearful
of
seeking
justice
for
crimes
committed
against
them
because
of
a
failure
to
prosecute
those
responsible

abuses

International
Airport
to
Amman
,
Jordan
,
Flight

was
hijacked
by
four
men
.


Iraqi
Airways
security
personnel
tried
to
stop
the
hijackers
,
but
a
hand
grenade
was
detonated
in
the
passenger
cabin
,
forcing
the
crew
to
initiate
an
emergency
descent
.


Another
hand
grenade
exploded
in
the
cockpit
,
causing
the
aircraft
to
crash
near
Arar
,
Saudi
Arabia
where
it
broke
in
two
and
caught
fire
.


There
were
106
people
on
board
,
and
60
passengers
and
3
crew
members
died
.


The
surviving
passengers
were
able
to
tell
authorities
what
transpired
on
the
aircraft
.


The
hijacking
was
one
of
the
deadliest
ever
,
and
was
one
of
many
in
1985
and
1986
.


Shortly
after
the
hijacking
,
the
pro-Iranian
group
Islamic
Jihad
Organization
(
a
widely
used
name
for
Hezbollah
)
claimed
responsibility

One
of

identified
by

and
known
in

as
``
the

''
(
,
``

)
,
began
on
6
june
1982
,
when
the
israel
defense
forces
(
idf
)
invaded
southern
lebanon
,
after
repeated
attacks
and
counter-attacks
between
the
palestine
liberation
organization
(
plo
)
operating
in
southern
lebanon
and
the
idf
that
had
caused
civilian
casualties
on
both
sides
of
the
border
.


The
military
operation
was
launched
after
gunmen
from
Abu
Nidal
's
organization
attempted
to
assassinate
Shlomo
Argov
,
Israel
's
ambassador
to
the
United
Kingdom
.


Israeli
Prime
Minister
Menachem
Begin
blamed
Abu
Nidal
's
enemy
,
the
PLO
,
for
the
incident
,
and
treated
the
incident
as
a
``
casus
belli
''
for
the
invasion
.


After
attacking
the
PLO
–
as
well
as
Syrian
,
leftist
,
and
Muslim
Lebanese
forces
–
the
Israeli
military
,
in
cooperation
with
their
Maronite
allies
and
the
self-proclaimed
Free
Lebanon
State
,
occupied
southern
Lebanon
,
eventually
surrounding
the
PLO
and
elements
of
the
Syrian
Army
.


Surrounded
in
West
Beirut
and
subjected
to
heavy
bombardment
,
the
PLO
forces
and
their
allies
negotiated
passage
from
Lebanon
with
the
aid
of
United
States
Special
Envoy
Philip
Habib
and
the
protection
of
international
peacekeepers
.


The
PLO
,
under
the
chairmanship
of
Yasser
Arafat
,
had
relocated
its
headquarters
to
Tripoli
in
June
1982
.


By
expelling
the
PLO
,
removing
Syrian
influence
over
Lebanon
,
and
installing
a
pro-Israeli
Christian
government
led
by
President
Bachir
Gemayel
,
Israel
hoped
to
sign
a
treaty
which
Menachem
Begin
promised
would
give
Israel
``
forty
years
of
peace
''
.


Following
the
assassination
of
Gemayel
in
September
1982
,
Israel
's
position
in
Beirut
became
untenable
and
the
signing
of
a
peace
treaty
became
increasingly
unlikely
.

following
israel
's
role
in
the
unk
sabra
and
shatila
massacre
,
of
mostly
palestinians
and
lebanese
shiites
,
and
israeli
popular
disillusionment
with
the
war
would
lead
to
a
gradual
withdrawal
from
beirut
to
the
areas
claimed
by
the
self-proclaimed
free
lebanon
state
in
southern
lebanon
(
later
to
become
the

)
,
which
was
initiated
following

and
syria
's
change
of

After
Israeli
forces
withdrew
from
most
of
Lebanon
,
the
War
of
the
Camps
broke
out
between
Lebanese
factions
,
the
remains
of
the
PLO
and
Syria
,
in
which
Syria
fought
its
former
Palestinian
allies
.


at
the

time
,

a
militant
groups
began
consolidating
and
waging
a
low-intensity
guerrilla
war
over
the
israeli

,
leading
to
15
years
of

conflict
.


The
Lebanese
Civil
War
would
continue
until
1990
,
at
which
point
Syria
had
established
complete
dominance
over
Lebanon
.


The
Haifa
Oil
Refinery
massacre
took
place
on
30
December
1947
in
Mandatory
Palestine
.


It
began
when
six
Arabs
were
killed
and
42
wounded
after
members
of
the
Zionist
paramilitary
organisation
,
the
Irgun
,
threw
a
number
of
grenades
at
a
crowd
of
about
100
Arab
day-labourers
.


These
Arab
day-labourers
had
gathered
outside
the
main
gate
of
the
then
British-owned
Haifa
Oil
Refinery
to
look
for
work
.


Minutes
after
this
Irgun
attack
,
Arab
refinery
workers
and
others
began
attacking
the
Jewish
refinery
workers
,
resulting
in
39
deaths
and
49
injuries
,
before
the
British
army
and
Palestine
Police
units
arrived
to
put
an
end
to
the
violence
.


This
came
to
be
known
as
the
``
Haifa
Oil
Refinery
massacre
''
.


Haganah
later
retaliated
by
attacking
two
nearby
Arab
villages
in
what
became
known
as
the
Balad
al-Shaykh
massacre
,
where
between
21
and
70
Arabs
were
killed
,
while
skirmishes
followed
in
Haifa
.


The
Greco-Persian
Wars
(
also
often
called
the
Persian
Wars
)
were
a
series
of
conflicts
between
the
Achaemenid
Empire
and
Greek
city-states
that
started
in
499
BC
and
lasted
until
449
BC
.


The
collision
between
the
fractious
political
world
of
the
Greeks
and
the
enormous
empire
of
the
Persians
began
when
Cyrus
the
Great
conquered
the
Greek-inhabited
region
of
Ionia
in
547
BC
.


Struggling
to
control
the
independent-minded
cities
of
Ionia
,
the
Persians
appointed
tyrants
to
rule
each
of
them
.


This
would
prove
to
be
the
source
of
much
trouble
for
the
Greeks
and
Persians
alike
.


In
499
BC
,
the
tyrant
of
Miletus
,
Aristagoras
,
embarked
on
an
expedition
to
conquer
the
island
of
Naxos
,
with
Persian
support
;
however
,
the
expedition
was
a
debacle
and
,
preempting
his
dismissal
,
Aristagoras
incited
all
of
Hellenic
Asia
Minor
into
rebellion
against
the
Persians
.


This
was
the
beginning
of
the
Ionian
Revolt
,
which
would
last
until
493
BC
,
progressively
drawing
more
regions
of
Asia
Minor
into
the
conflict
.


Aristagoras
secured
military
support
from
Athens
and
Eretria
,
and
in
498
BC
these
forces
helped
to
capture
and
burn
the
Persian
regional
capital
of
Sardis
.


The
Persian
king
Darius
the
Great
vowed
to
have
revenge
on
Athens
and
Eretria
for
this
act
.


The
revolt
continued
,
with
the
two
sides
effectively
stalemated
throughout
497–495
BC
.


In
494
BC
,
the
Persians
regrouped
and
attacked
the
epicenter
of
the
revolt
in
Miletus
.


at
the
battle
of
lade
,
the
ionians
suffered
a
decisive
defeat
,
and
the
rebellion
collapsed
,
with
the
final
members
being
stamped
out
the
following
year
.


Seeking
to
secure
his
empire
from
further
revolts
and
from
the
interference
of
the
mainland
Greeks
,
Darius
embarked
on
a
scheme
to
conquer
Greece
and
to
punish
Athens
and
Eretria
for
the
burning
of
Sardis
.


The
first
Persian
invasion
of
Greece
began
in
492
BC
,
with
the
Persian
general
Mardonius
successfully
re-subjugating
Thrace
and
Macedon
before
several
mishaps
forced
an
early
end
to
the
rest
of
the
campaign
.


In
490
BC
a
second
force
was
sent
to
Greece
,
this
time
across
the
Aegean
Sea
,
under
the
command
of
Datis
and
Artaphernes
.


This
expedition
subjugated
the
Cyclades
,
before
besieging
,
capturing
and
razing
Eretria
.


However
,
while
en
route
to
attack
Athens
,
the
Persian
force
was
decisively
defeated
by
the
Athenians
at
the
Battle
of
Marathon
,
ending
Persian
efforts
for
the
time
being
.


Darius
then
began
to
plan
to
completely
conquer
Greece
but
died
in
486
BC
and
responsibility
for
the
conquest
passed
to
his
son
Xerxes
.


In
480
BC
,
Xerxes
personally
led
the
second
Persian
invasion
of
Greece
with
one
of
the
largest
ancient
armies
ever
assembled
.


Victory
over
the
allied
Greek
states
at
the
famous
Battle
of
Thermopylae
allowed
the
Persians
to
torch
an
evacuated
Athens
and
overrun
most
of
Greece
.


However
,
while
seeking
to
destroy
the
combined
Greek
fleet
,
the
Persians
suffered
a
severe
defeat
at
the
Battle
of
Salamis
.


The
following
year
,
the
confederated
Greeks
went
on
the
offensive
,
decisively
defeating
the
Persian
army
at
the
Battle
of
Plataea
,
and
ending
the
invasion
of
Greece
by
the
Achaemenid
Empire
.


The
allied
Greeks
followed
up
their
success
by
destroying
the
rest
of
the
Persian
fleet
at
the
Battle
of
Mycale
,
before
expelling
Persian
garrisons
from
Sestos
(
479
BC
)
and
Byzantium
(
478
BC
)
.


Following
the
Persian
withdrawal
from
Europe
and
the
Greek
victory
at
Mycale
,
Macedon
and
the
city-states
of
Ionia
regained
their
independence
.


The
actions
of
the
general
Pausanias
at
the
siege
of
Byzantium
alienated
many
of
the
Greek
states
from
the
Spartans
,
and
the
anti-Persian
alliance
was
therefore
reconstituted
around
Athenian
leadership
,
called
the
Delian
League
.


The
Delian
League
continued
to
campaign
against
Persia
for
the
next
three
decades
,
beginning
with
the
expulsion
of
the
remaining
Persian
garrisons
from
Europe
.


at
the
battle
of
the
eurymedon
in
466
bc
,
the
league
won
a
double
victory
that
finally
secured
freedom
for
the
cities
of
ionia
.


However
,
the
League
's
involvement
in
the
Egyptian
revolt
by
Inaros
II
against
Artaxerxes
I
(
from
460–454
BC
)
resulted
in
a
disastrous
defeat
,
and
further
campaigning
was
suspended
.


A
Greek
fleet
was
sent
to
Cyprus
in
451
BC
,
but
achieved
little
,
and
,
when
it
withdrew
,
the
Greco-Persian
Wars
drew
to
a
quiet
end
.


Some
historical
sources
suggest
the
end
of
hostilities
was
marked
by
a
peace
treaty
between
Athens
and
Persia
,
the
Peace
of
Callias
.


The
1973
Israeli
raid
on
Lebanon
(
known
as
Operation
Spring
of
Youth
,
Hebrew
:
מבצע
אביב
נעורים
,
``
Mitzva
Aviv
Ne'urim
''
)
took
place
on
the
night
of
April
9
and
early
morning
of
April
10
,
1973
,
when
Israeli
army
special
forces
units
attacked
several
Palestine
Liberation
Organization
(
PLO
)
targets
in
Beirut
and
Sidon
,
Lebanon
.


The
operation
is
generally
considered
to
have
been
part
of
Operation
Wrath
of
God
,
Israel
's
retaliation
for
the
Munich
massacre
at
the
Summer
Olympics
in
1972
.


The
Israeli
troops
arrived
at
the
Lebanese
beaches
on
speedboats
launched
from
missile
boats
offshore
.


Mossad
agents
awaited
the
forces
on
the
beaches
with
cars
rented
the
previous
day
,
and
then
drove
them
to
their
targets
and
later
back
to
the
beaches
for
extraction
.


During
the
operation
,
three
of
the
highest-level
PLO
leaders
,
surprised
at
home
,
were
killed
,
along
with
other
PLO
members
.


Several
Lebanese
security
people
and
civilian
neighbors
were
also
killed
,
as
were
two
of
the
Israeli
soldiers
.


Lê
Hoàng
Hùng
(
1960
–
29
January
2011
)
,
a
Vietnamese
investigative
journalist
,
worked
for
``
Người
Lao
Động
''
(
``
The
Worker
''
)
in
Tân
An
,
Vietnam
,
where
he
covered
corruption
and
crime
.


He
was
burned
to
death
by
his
wife
.


Initially
,
because
of
his
high-profile
reporting
and
the
original
story
told
by
Hung
's
wife
about
his
death
,
police
and
organizations
concerned
with
press
safety
believed
Hung
had
been
killed
in
revenge
for
stories
he
had
recently
published
.


While
his
wife
Tran
Thi
Thuy
Lieu
originally
claimed
``
a
stranger
broke
into
their
house
''
and
burned
her
husband
,
she
later
recanted
and
admitted
guilt
.


The
last
journalist
to
have
been
killed
in
Vietnam
for
his
journalism
was
Duong
Hung
Cuong
in
1988
.


When
the
Committee
to
Protect
Journalists
listed
Hung
as
a
``
motive
confirmed
''
case
after
his
death
,
this
would
have
made
Hung
the
first
journalist
who
would
have
been
killed
as
a
result
of
reporting
in
Vietnam
in
23
years
,
except
it
was
learned
later
that
he
was
killed
by
his
wife
for
a
non-reporting
motive
.


The
Kingsmill
massacre
was
a
mass
shooting
that
took
place
on
5
January
1976
near
the
village
of
Whitecross
in
south
County
Armagh
,
Northern
Ireland
.


Gunmen
stopped
a
minibus
carrying
eleven
Protestant
workmen
,
lined
them
up
alongside
it
and
shot
them
.


Only
one
victim
survived
,
despite
having
been
shot
18
times
.


A
Catholic
man
on
the
minibus
was
allowed
to
go
free
.


a
group
calling
itself
the
south
armagh
republican
action
force
claimed
responsibility
.


It
said
the
shooting
was
retaliation
for
a
string
of
attacks
on
Catholic
civilians
in
the
area
by
Loyalists
,
particularly
the
killing
of
six
Catholics
the
night
before
.


The
Kingsmill
massacre
was
the
climax
of
a
string
of
tit-for-tat
killings
in
the
area
during
the
mid-1970s
,
and
was
one
of
the
deadliest
mass
shootings
of
the
Troubles
.


A
2011
report
by
the
Historical
Enquiries
Team
(
HET
)
found
that
members
of
the
Provisional
IRA
carried
out
the
attack
,
despite
the
organisation
being
on
ceasefire
.


The
HET
report
said
that
the
men
were
targeted
because
they
were
Protestants
and
that
,
although
it
was
a
response
to
the
night
before
,
it
had
been
planned
.


The
weapons
used
were
linked
to
110
other
attacks
.


following
the
massacre
,
the
british
government
declared
county
armagh
to
be
a
``
special
emergency
area
''
and
hundreds
of
extra
troops
and
police
were
deployed
in
the
area
.


it
also
announced
that
the
special
air
service
(
sas
)
was
being
moved
into
south
armagh
.


This
was
the
first
time
that
SAS
presence
in
Northern
Ireland
was
officially
acknowledged
.


In

1941
,

Herzegovina
rebelled
against

,
an
Axis
puppet
state
established
during
World

on
the

occupied
Kingdom
of
Yugoslavia
.


As
the
NDH
imposed
its
authority
,
members
of
the
fascist
Ustaše
ruling
party
began
a
campaign
of
persecution
of

Ustaše
perpetrated
a
series
of
massacres
and
attacks
against
the
majority
Serb
population
commencing
in
the
first
week
of
June
.


Between
3
and
22
June
1941
,
spontaneous
clashes
occurred
between
NDH
authorities
and
groups
of
Serbs
in
the
region
.


The
German
invasion
of
the
Soviet
Union
began
on
22
June
.


over
the
next
two
days
,
the
sporadic
revolts
by
serbs
against
the
ndh
in
eastern
herzegovina
erupted
into
mass
rebellion
,
triggered
by
UNK
persecution
,
serb
solidarity
with
the
russian
people
,
hatred
and
fear
of
the
ndh
authorities
,
and
other
factors
.


Serb
rebels
,
under
the
leadership
of
both
local
Serbs
and
Montenegrins
,
attacked
police
,
gendarmerie
,
Ustaše
and
Croatian
Home
Guard
forces
in
the
region
.


In
the
first
few
days
,
the
rebels
captured
gendarmerie
posts
in
several
villages
,
set
up
roadblocks
on
the
major
roads
and
ambushed
several
military
vehicles
.


On
the
night
of
26
June
,
the
rebels
mounted
a
sustained
attack
on
the
town
of
Nevesinje
in
an
attempt
to
capture
it
,
but
the
garrison
held
out
until
the
morning
of
28
June
when
NDH
troops
broke
through
the
rebel
roadblocks
.


On
28
June
,
the
rebels
ambushed
a
truckload
of
Italian
soldiers
,
prompting
the
Italian
Army
commander
in
the
NDH
to
warn
the
NDH
government
that
he
would
take
unilateral
action
to
secure
communication
routes
.


A
further
gendarmerie
post
was
destroyed
by
the
rebels
,
and
in
the
evening
the
rebels
captured
the
village
of
Avtovac
,
looting
and
burning
it
,
and
killing
dozens
of
non-Serb
civilians
.


The
following
day
an
Italian
column
cleared
the
rebels
from
Avtovac
and
relieved
the
hard-pressed
NDH
garrison
in
the
town
of
Gacko
.


From
3
July
,
an
NDH
force
of
over
2,000
fanned
out
from
Nevesinje
,
clearing
towns
,
villages
and
routes
of
rebels
.


The
rebel
forces
did
not
put
up
any
significant
opposition
to
the
clearing
operation
,
and
either
retreated
into
nearby
Montenegro
,
or
hid
their
weapons
in
the
mountains
and
went
home
.


By
7
July
,
NDH
forces
had
regained
full
control
of
all
towns
and
major
transport
routes
in
eastern
Herzegovina
.


The
Indo-Pakistani
War
of
1965
was
a
culmination
of
skirmishes
that
took
place
between
April
1965
and
September
1965
between
Pakistan
and
India
.


The
conflict
began
following
Pakistan
's
Operation
Gibraltar
,
which
was
designed
to
infiltrate
forces
into
Jammu
and
Kashmir
to
precipitate
an
insurgency
against
Indian
rule
.


India
retaliated
by
launching
a
full-scale
military
attack
on
West
Pakistan
.


the
unk
war
caused
thousands
of
casualties
on
both
sides
and
witnessed
the
largest
engagement
of
armored
vehicles
and
the
largest
tank
battle
since
world
war
ii
.


Hostilities
between
the
two
countries
ended
after
a
United
Nations-mandated
ceasefire
was
declared
following
diplomatic
intervention
by
the
Soviet
Union
and
the
United
States
,
and
the
subsequent
issuance
of
the
Tashkent
Declaration
.


Much
of
the
war
was
fought
by
the
countries
'
land
forces
in
Kashmir
and
along
the
border
between
India
and
Pakistan
.


This
war
saw
the
largest
amassing
of
troops
in
Kashmir
since
the
Partition
of
India
in
1947
,
a
number
that
was
overshadowed
only
during
the
2001–2002
military
standoff
between
India
and
Pakistan
.


Most
of
the
battles
were
fought
by
opposing
infantry
and
armoured
units
,
with
substantial
backing
from
air
forces
,
and
naval
operations
.


Many
details
of
this
war
,
like
those
of
other
Indo-Pakistani
Wars
,
remain
unclear
.


India
had
the
upper
hand
over
Pakistan
when
the
ceasefire
was
declared
.


although
the
two
countries
fought
to
a
standoff
,
the
conflict
is
seen
as
a
strategic
and
political
defeat
for
pakistan
,
as
it
had
neither
succeeded
in
fomenting
insurrection
in
kashmir
nor
had
it
been
able
to
gain
meaningful
support
at
an
international
level
.


Internationally
,
the
war
was
viewed
in
the
context
of
the
greater
Cold
War
,
and
resulted
in
a
significant
geopolitical
shift
in
the
subcontinent
.


Before
the
war
,
the
United
States
and
the
United
Kingdom
had
been
major
material
allies
of
both
India
and
Pakistan
,
as
their
primary
suppliers
of
military
hardware
and
foreign
developmental
aid
.


During
and
after
the
conflict
,
both
India
and
Pakistan
felt
betrayed
by
the
perceived
lack
of
support
by
the
western
powers
for
their
respective
positions
;
those
feelings
of
betrayal
were
increased
with
the
imposition
of
an
American
and
British
embargo
on
military
aid
to
the
opposing
sides
.


As
a
consequence
,
India
and
Pakistan
openly
developed
closer
relationships
with
the
Soviet
Union
and
China
,
respectively
.


The
perceived
negative
stance
of
the
western
powers
during
the
conflict
,
and
during
the
1971
war
,
has
continued
to
affect
relations
between
the
West
and
the
subcontinent
.


In
spite
of
improved
relations
with
the
U.S.
and
Britain
since
the
end
of
the
Cold
War
,
the
conflict
generated
a
deep
distrust
of
both
countries
within
the
subcontinent
which
to
an
extent
lingers
to
this
day
.


On
15
August
2013
,
a
car
bomb
exploded
in
Beirut
,
Lebanon
killing
twenty
seven
people
and
injuring
over
two-hundred
people
.


The
car
bomb
was
intended
for
the
stronghold
of
Hezbollah
.


The
Islamist
group
Aisha
Umm-al
Mouemeneen
,
also
known
as
Brigades
of
Aisha
,
were
responsible
for
the
explosion
.


In
their
statement
the
group
accused
Hezbollah
of
being
Iranian
agents
and
threatened
more
attacks
.


``
This
is
the
second
time
that
we
decide
the
time
and
place
of
the
battle
...
And
you
will
see
more
,
God
willing
,
''
However
Interior
Minister
Marwan
Charbel
and
other
politicians
blamed
Israel
for
the
attack
.


The
bombing
came
``
amid
sectarian
tensions
''
over
the
intervention
of
Shi'ite
Muslim
Hezbollah
against
Sunni
rebels
in
the
Syrian
civil
war
.


A
month
earlier
a
car
bomb
injured
more
than
50
people
in
the
same
district
.


A
week
later
two
mosques
were
bombed
in
Tripoli
killing
over
40
and
injuring
hundreds
.


The
Tripoli
bombing
were
thought
to
be
in
retaliation
for
the
Beirut
bombing
.


Political
analyst
Anno
Bunnik
has
warned
that
Sunni
militants
would
likely
target
Hezbollah
areas
in
response
to
its
role
in
the
Syrian
Civil
War
.


Operation
Blue
Star
was
the
codename
of
an
Indian
military
action
carried
out
between
1
and
8
June
1984
to
remove
militant
religious
leader
Jarnail
Singh
Bhindranwale
and
his
followers
from
the
buildings
of
the
Harmandir
Sahib
(
Golden
Temple
)
complex
in
Amritsar
,
Punjab
.


The
decision
to
launch
the
attack
rested
with
Prime
Minister
Indira
Gandhi
.


In
July
1982
,
Harchand
Singh
Longowal
,
the
President
of
the
Sikh
political
party
Akali
Dal
,
had
invited
Bhindranwale
to
take
up
residence
in
the
Golden
Temple
Complex
to
evade
arrest
.


Bhindranwale
later
made
the
sacred
temple
complex
an
armoury
and
headquarters
.


Indian
intelligence
agencies
had
reported
that
three
prominent
heads
of
the
Khalistan
movement
–
Shabeg
Singh
,
Balbier
Singh
,
and
Amrik
Singh
–
had
made
at
least
six
trips
each
to
Pakistan
between
the
years
1981
and
1983
.


The
Intelligence
Bureau
reported
that
weapons
training
was
being
provided
at
gurdwaras
in
Jammu
and
Kashmir
and
Himachal
Pradesh
.


The
Soviet
intelligence
agency
KGB
reportedly
tipped
off
the
Indian
agency
RAW
about
the
CIA
and
ISI
working
together
on
a
plan
for
Punjab
.


from
its
interrogation
of
a
pakistani
army
officer
,
raw
received
information
that
over
a
thousand
trained
special
service
group
commandos
of
the
pakistan
army
had
been
dispatched
by
pakistan
into
the
indian
punjab
to
assist
bhindranwale
in
his
fight
against
the
government
.


A
large
number
of
Pakistani
agents
also
took
the
smuggling
routes
in
the
Kashmir
and
Kutch
region
of
Gujarat
,
with
plans
to
commit
sabotage
.


On
1
June
1984
,
after
negotiations
with
the
militants
failed
,
Indira
Gandhi
ordered
the
army
to
launch
Operation
Blue
Star
.


A
variety
of
army
units
and
paramilitary
forces
surrounded
the
temple
complex
on
3
June
1984
.


The
army
used
loudspeakers
to
encourage
the
militants
to
surrender
.


Requests
were
also
made
to
the
militants
to
allow
trapped
pilgrims
to
come
out
of
the
temple
premises
,
before
the
clash
with
the
army
.


However
,
no
surrender
or
release
of
pilgrims
occurred
until
7:00
pm
on
5
June
.


The
fighting
started
on
5
June
with
skirmishes
and
the
battle
went
on
for
three
days
,
ending
on
8
June
.


A
clean-up
operation
codenamed
Operation
Woodrose
was
also
initiated
throughout
Punjab
.


The
army
had
underestimated
the
firepower
possessed
by
the
militants
,
whose
armament
included
Chinese-made
rocket-propelled
grenade
launchers
with
armour
piercing
capabilities
.


Tanks
and
heavy
artillery
were
used
to
attack
the
militants
,
who
responded
with
anti-tank
and
machine-gun
fire
from
the
heavily
fortified
Akal
Takht
.


After
a
24-hour
firefight
,
the
army
gained
control
of
the
temple
complex
.


Casualty
figures
for
the
Army
were
83
dead
and
249
injured
.


According
to
the
official
estimates
,
1,592
militants
were
apprehended
and
there
were
493
combined
militant
and
civilian
casualties
.


High
civilian
casualties
were
attributed
to
militants
using
pilgrims
trapped
inside
the
temple
as
human
shields
.


The
military
action
in
the
temple
complex
was
criticized
by
Sikhs
worldwide
,
who
interpreted
it
as
an
assault
on
the
Sikh
religion
.


Many
Sikh
soldiers
in
the
Army
deserted
their
units
,
several
Sikhs
resigned
from
civil
administrative
office
and
returned
awards
received
from
the
Indian
government
.


Five
months
after
the
operation
,
on
31
October
1984
,
Indira
Gandhi
was
assassinated
in
an
act
of
revenge
by
her
two
Sikh
bodyguards
,
Satwant
Singh
and
Beant
Singh
.


Public
outcry
over
Gandhi
's
death
led
to
the
killings
of
more
than
3,000
Sikhs
in
the
ensuing
1984
anti-Sikh
riots
.


The
Castle
Hill
rebellion
of
1804
was
a
rebellion
by
convicts
against
colonial
authority
of
the
British
colony
of
New
South
Wales
in
the
Castle
Hill
area
,
in
Sydney
.


The
rebellion
culminated
in
a
battle
fought
between
convicts
and
the
colonial
forces
of
Australia
on
5
March
1804
at
Rouse
Hill
,
dubbed
the
Second
Battle
of
Vinegar
Hill
after
the
first
Battle
of
Vinegar
Hill
which
had
taken
place
in
1798
in
Ireland
.


It
was
the
first
and
only
major
convict
uprising
in
Australian
history
suppressed
under
martial
law
.


On
4
March
1804
,
according
to
the
official
accounts
233
convicts
led
by
Philip
Cunningham
(
a
veteran
of
the
Irish
Rebellion
of
1798
,
as
well
as
mutiny
on
the
convict
transport
ship
``
Anne
''
)
escaped
from
a
prison
farm
intent
on
``
capturing
ships
to
sail
to
Ireland
''
.


In
response
,
martial
law
was
quickly
declared
in
the
Colony
of
New
South
Wales
.


The
mostly
Irish
rebels
,
having
gathered
reinforcements
,
were
hunted
by
the
colonial
forces
until
they
were
sequestered
on
5
March
1804
on
a
hillock
nicknamed
Vinegar
Hill
.


Under
a
flag
of
truce
,
Cunningham
was
arrested
and
troops
charged
and
the
rebellion
was
crushed
by
a
raid
.


Nine
of
the
rebel
leaders
were
executed
and
hundreds
were
punished
before
martial
law
was
finally
revoked
a
week
after
the
battle
.


Lady
Gaga
Live
at
Roseland
Ballroom
was
the
first
concert
residency
by
American
singer
Lady
Gaga
.


Performed
at
the
Roseland

began
on
March
28
and
concluded
on

The
Sejny
Uprising
or
Seinai
Revolt
(
,
)
refers
to
a
Polish
uprising
against
the
Lithuanian
authorities
in
August
1919
in
the
ethnically
mixed
area
surrounding
the
town
of
Sejny
(
Lithuanian
:
``
Seinai
''
)
.


When
German
forces
,
which
occupied
the
territory
during
World
War
I
,
retreated
from
the
area
in
May
1919
,
they
turned
over
administration
to
the
Lithuanians
.


Trying
to
prevent
an
armed
conflict
between
Poland
and
Lithuania
,
the
Entente
drew
a
demarcation
line
,
known
as
the
Foch
Line
.


The
line
assigned
much
of
the
disputed
Suwałki
(
Suvalkai
)
Region
to
Poland
and
required
the
Lithuanian
Army
to
retreat
.


While
the
Lithuanians
retreated
from
some
areas
,
they
refused
to
leave
Sejny
(
Seinai
)
,
because
of
its
major
Lithuanian
population
.


Polish
irregular
forces
began
the
uprising
on
August
23
,
1919
,
and
soon
received
support
from
the
regular
Polish
Army
.


After
several
military
skirmishes
,
Polish
forces
secured
Sejny
and
Lithuanians
retreated
behind
the
Foch
Line
.


The
uprising
did
not
solve
the
larger
border
conflict
between
Poland
and
Lithuania
over
the
ethnically
mixed
Suwałki
Region
.


Both
sides
complained
about
each
other
's
repressive
measures
.


The
conflict
intensified
in
1920
,
causing
military
skirmishes
of
the
Polish–Lithuanian
War
.


sejny
changed
hands
frequently
until
the
UNK
agreement
of
october
1920
,
which
left
sejny
on
the
polish
side
.


The
uprising
undermined
the
plans
of
Polish
leader
Józef
Piłsudski
,
who
was
planning
a
coup
d'état
in
Lithuania
to
replace
the
Lithuanian
government
with
a
pro-Polish
cabinet
,
that
would
agree
to
a
union
with
Poland
(
the
proposed
Międzymorze
federation
)
.


Because
the
Sejny
Uprising
had
prompted
the
Lithuanian
intelligence
to
intensify
its
investigations
of
Polish
activities
in
Lithuania
,
they
discovered
plans
for
the
coup
and
prevented
it
,
arresting
Polish
sympathizers
.


These
hostilities
in
Sejny
further
strained
the
Polish–Lithuanian
relations
.


Eventually
,
Poland
and
Lithuania
reached
an
agreement
on
a
new
border
that
left
Sejny
on
the
Polish
side
of
the
border
.


The
Polish–Lithuanian
border
in

same
since
then
(
with
the
exception
of
the
World

The
Monster
Ball
Tour
was
the
second
worldwide
concert
tour
by
American
singer
Lady
Gaga
.


Staged
in
support
of
her
extended
play
``
The
Fame
Monster
''
(
2009
)
and
comprising
a
set
list
of
songs
from
that
and
her
debut
album
``
The
Fame
''
(
2008
)
,
the
tour
visited
arenas
and
stadiums
from
2009
through
2011
.


Described
as
``
the
first-ever
pop
electro
opera
''
by
Gaga
,
the
tour
was
announced
in
October
2009
after
with
rapper
Kanye
West
was
suddenly
canceled
.


The
Monster
Ball
Tour
commenced
four
days
after
the
release
of
``
The
Fame
Monster
''
in
November
2009
.


A
revision
of
the
tour
occurred
after
only
a
few
months
of
performances
,
due
to
Gaga
's
concern
that
the
original
version
was
constructed
within
a
very
short
span
of
time
.


The
stage
of
the
original
show
looked
like
a
frame
,
comparable
to
that
of
a
hollowed-out
television
set
.


since
``
the
fame
monster
''
dealt
with
the
paranoias
gaga
had
faced
,
the
main
theme
of
the
original
shows
became
human
evolution
,
while
elements
of
the
canceled
tour
with
west
were
still
included
in
some
parts
.


From
2010
onwards
,
the
revamped
shows
had
a
New
York
theme
and
portrayed
a
story
set
in
the
city
,
where
Gaga
and
her
friends
got
lost
and
had
to
find
their
way
to
``
the
Monster
Ball
''
.


Both
versions
of
the
show
were
divided
into
five
segments
,
with
the
last
being
the
encore
.


Each
of
them
featured
Gaga
in
new
outfits
,
singing
songs
related
to
the
concept
of
the
segment
,
as
they
were
followed
by
a
video
interlude
.


The
tour
received
positive
reviews
,
with
critics
praising
Gaga
's
singing
abilities
and
the
theatricality
of
the
show
.


The
Monster
Ball
was
a
commercial
success
,
with
extra
demand
for
tickets
prompting
organizers
to
add
multiple
dates
to
the
itinerary
.


It
ultimately
grossed
an
estimated
US
$
227.4
million
from
200
reported
shows
,
attended
by
an
audience
of
2.5
million
.


at
the
2010
``
billboard
''
touring
awards
,
gaga
won
the
breakthrough
performer
award
,
as
well
as
the
concert
marketing
&
promotion
award
.


HBO
filmed
a
special
of
The
Monster

Tour
during

's
February
2011

The
Blitz
was
a
German
bombing
campaign
against
the
United
Kingdom
in
1940
and
1941
,
during
the
Second
World
War
.


The
term
was
first
used
by
the
British
press
and
is
the
German
word
for
'lightning
'
.


the
germans
conducted
mass
air
attacks
against
industrial
targets
,
towns
,
and
cities
,
beginning
with
raids
on
london
towards
the
end
of
the
battle
of
britain
in
1940
,
a
battle
for
daylight
air
superiority
between
the
``
luftwaffe
''
and
the
royal
air
force
over
the
united
kingdom
.


By
September
1940
,
the
``
Luftwaffe
''
had
failed
and
the
German
air
fleets
(
``
Luftflotten
''
)
were
ordered
to
attack
London
,
to
draw
RAF
Fighter
Command
into
a
battle
of
annihilation
.


Adolf
Hitler
and
``
Reichsmarschall
''
Hermann
Göring
,
commander-in-chief
of
the
``
Luftwaffe
''
,
ordered
the
new
policy
on
6
September
1940
.


From
7
September
1940
,
London
was
systematically
bombed
by
the
``
Luftwaffe
''
for
56
of
the
following
57
days
and
nights
.


Most
notable
was
a
large
daylight
attack
against
London
on
15
September
.


The
``
Luftwaffe
''
gradually
decreased
daylight
operations
in
favour
of
night
attacks
to
evade
attack
by
the
RAF
,
and
the
Blitz
became
a
night
bombing
campaign
after
October
1940
.


The
``
Luftwaffe
''
attacked
the
main
Atlantic
sea
port
of
Liverpool
in
the
Liverpool
Blitz
.


The
North
Sea
port
of
Hull
,
a
convenient
and
easily
found
target
or
secondary
target
for
bombers
unable
to
locate
their
primary
targets
,
suffered
the
Hull
Blitz
.


Bristol
,
Cardiff
,
Portsmouth
,
Plymouth
,
Southampton
and
Swansea
were
also
bombed
,
as
were
the
industrial
cities
of
Birmingham
,
Belfast
,
Coventry
,
Glasgow
,
Manchester
and
Sheffield
.


More
than
40,000
civilians
were
killed
by
``
Luftwaffe
''
bombing
during
the
war
,
almost
half
of
them
in
the
capital
,
where
more
than
a
million
houses
were
destroyed
or
damaged
.


In
early
July
1940
,
the
German
High
Command
began
planning
Operation
Barbarossa
,
the
invasion
of
the
Soviet
Union
.


Bombing
failed
to
demoralise
the
British
into
surrender
or
do
much
damage
to
the
war
economy
;
eight
months
of
bombing
never
seriously
hampered
British
war
production
,
which
continued
to
increase
.


The
greatest
effect
was
to
force
the
British
to
disperse
the
production
of
aircraft
and
spare
parts
.


British
wartime
studies
concluded
that
cities
generally
took
10
to
15
days
to
recover
when
hit
severely
,
but
exceptions
like
Birmingham
took
three
months
.


The
German
air
offensive
failed
because
the
``
Luftwaffe
''
High
Command
(
``
Oberkommando
der
Luftwaffe
''
,
``
OKL
''
)
did
not
develop
a
methodical
strategy
for
destroying
British
war
industry
.


Poor
intelligence
about
British
industry
and
economic
efficiency
led
to
``
OKL
''
concentrating
on
tactics
rather
than
strategy
.


The
bombing
effort
was
diluted
by
attacks
against
several
sets
of
industries
instead
of
constant
pressure
on
the
most
vital
.

Jesus
Christ
,
son
of
God
,
died
on
the
cross
to
take
away
all
of
mankind
's
sin
,
but
then
was
raised
from
the
dead
and
given
eternal
life
.


Therefore
,
from
the
love
and
mercy
given
by
God
,
Christians
as
a
people
must
share
the
message
of
Christ
.


The
festival
's

A
Tribute
to
Our
Creator

The
Invasion
of
the
Waikato
was
the
biggest
and
most
important
campaign
of
the
19th
century
New
Zealand
Wars
,
fought
in
the
North
Island
of
New
Zealand
between
the
military
forces
of
the
colonial
government
and
a
federation
of
Māori
tribes
known
as
the
``
Kingitanga
Movement
''
.


The
Waikato
is
a
territorial
region
with
a
northern
boundary
somewhat
south
of
the
city
of
Auckland
.


Hostilities
lasted
for
nine
months
,
from
July
1863
to
April
1864
.


The
invasion
was
aimed
at
crushing
Kingite
power
,
which
was
seen
as
a
threat
to
British
authority
,
and
also
at
driving
Waikato
Māori
from
their
territory
in
readiness
for
occupation
and
settlement
by
Europeans
.


The
campaign
was
fought
by
a
peak
of
about
14,000
Imperial
and
colonial
troops
and
about
4,000
Māori
warriors
drawn
from
more
than
half
the
major
North
Island
tribal
groups
.


plans
for
the
invasion
were
drawn
up
at
the
close
of
the
first
taranaki
war
in
1861
but
were
opposed
by
the
colonial
office
and
new
zealand
general
assembly
and
suspended
by
incoming
governor
sir
george
grey
in
december
of
that
year
.


Grey
reactivated
the
invasion
plans
in
June
1863
amid
mounting
tension
between
Kingites
and
the
colonial
government
and
fears
of
a
violent
raid
on
Auckland
by
Kingite
Māori
.


Grey
used
as
the
trigger
for
the
invasion
Kingite
rejection
of
his
ultimatum
on
9
July
1863
that
all
Māori
living
between
Auckland
and
the
Waikato
take
an
oath
of
allegiance
to
Queen
Victoria
or
be
expelled
south
of
the
Waikato
River
.


Troops
crossed
into
Waikato
territory
three
days
later
and
launched
their
first
attack
on
17
July
at
Koheroa
,
but
were
unable
to
advance
for
another
14
weeks
.


The
subsequent
war
included
the
Battle
of
Rangiriri—which
cost
both
sides
more
men
than
any
other
engagement
of
the
New
Zealand
Wars—and
the
three-day-long
Battle
of
Ōrākau
,
probably
the
best-known
engagement
of
the
New
Zealand
Wars
and
which
inspired
two
films
called
``
Rewi
's
Last
Stand
''
.


The
campaign
ended
with
the
retreat
of
the
Kingitanga
Māori
into
the
rugged
interior
of
the
North
Island
and
the
confiscation
of
about
12,000
km
of
Māori
land
.


The
defeat
and
confiscations
left
the
King
Movement
tribes
with
a
legacy
of
poverty
and
bitterness
that
was
partly
assuaged
in
1995
when
the
government
conceded
that
the
1863
invasion
and
confiscation
was
wrongful
and
apologised
for
its
actions
.


The
Waikato–Tainui
tribe
accepted
a
compensation
of
cash
and
some
government-controlled
lands
totalling
about
$
171
million—about
1
percent
of
the
value
of
the
lands
confiscated
in
1863—and
later
that
year
Queen
Elizabeth
II
personally
signed
the
Waikato
Raupatu
Claims
Settlement
Act
1995
.


The
Governor-General
normally
gives
Royal
Assent
to
legislation
by
signing
on
her
behalf
.


Background
and
origins
of
the
invasion
.


The
First
Taranaki
War
had
ended
in
March
1861
as
an
uneasy
truce
between
the
government
and
Māori
forces
,
with
both
sides
recognising
they
had
reached
a
stalemate
.


The
lack
of
a
clear
victory
by
imperial
forces
led
Governor
Thomas
Gore
Browne
to
turn
his
attention
to
the
Waikato
,
the
centre
of
the
Kingite
movement
,
where
king
Tāwhiao
was
attracting
the
allegiance
of
increasing
numbers
of
Māori
across
the
North
Island
.


Browne
concluded
that
members
of
the
Kingite
movement
would
have
to
be
compelled
to
submit
to
British
rule
.


after
attempting
to
achieve
a
peace
settlement
through
``
kingmaker
''
wiremu
tamihana
,
in
unk
he
sent
an
ultimatum
to
the
movement
's
leaders
,
demanding
submission
to
queen
victoria
and
the
return
of
plunder
taken
from
taranaki
;
when
it
was
rejected
he
began
drawing
up
plans
to
invade
the
waikato
and
depose
the
unk
plan
opposed
by
both
the
colonial
office
and
the
new
zealand
general
assembly
.


According
to
Browne
,
in
response
to
his
belligerence
,
Kingite
leaders
formed
plans
to
launch
a
raid
on
Auckland
on
1
September
and
burn
the
town
and
slaughter
most
of
its
residents
.


This
has
since
been
dismissed
by
such
historians
as
James
Belich
as
being
fear-mongering
from
Browne
in
order
to
try
and
gain
military
support
.


Browne
's
invasion
plan
was
suspended
when
he
was
replaced
by
Sir
George
Grey
in
September
that
year
,
and
the
Kingites
in
turn
abandoned
their
plan
for
their
uprising
.


Grey
instead
instituted
a
peace
policy
that
included
a
system
of
Māori
local
administration
in
which
they
could
participate
,
hoping
it
would
encourage
Māori
to
abandon
the
Kingite
movement
and
``
reduce
the
number
of
our
enemies
''
.


at
the
same
time
,
however
,
grey
began
planning
for
war
,
using
troops
from
the
newly
formed
commissariat
transport
corps
to
start
construction
work
on
a
road
from
drury
that
would
run
about
18
km
south
through
forest
to
the
unk
border
at
the
unk
unk
tributary
of
the
waikato
unk
unk
.


The
so-called
Great
South
Road
would
provide
quick
access
to
troops
in
the
event
of
an
invasion
.


Using
what
historian
James
Belich
describes
as
a
campaign
of
misinformation
,
Grey
retained
the
Taranaki
army
and
began
appealing
to
the
colonial
office
for
more
troops
to
avert
``
some
great
disaster
''
,
claiming
tensions
remained
high
,
with
a
high
likelihood
of
Māori
aggression
.


In
November
1862
he
ordered
a
gunboat
steamer
from
Sydney
and
purchased
another
in
Lyttelton
to
supplement
the
supply
system
.


By
early
1863
the
imperial
government
had
provided
Grey
with
3000
men
for
the
expected
war
.


Events
in
early
1863
brought
tensions
to
a
head
.


In
March
Kingites
obstructed
the
construction
of
a
police
station
at
Te
Kohekohe
,
near
Meremere
,
and
80
armed
warriors
raided
the
80
hectare
property
at
Te
Awamutu
occupied
by
magistrate
and
Commissioner
John
Gorst
,
seizing
the
printing
press
on
which
he
published
a
newspaper
and
taking
it
to
Kihikihi
.


The
raiders
,
led
by
Rewi
Maniapoto
and
Wiremu
Kīngi
,
sent
a
message
to
Gorst—who
was
absent
at
the
time—to
quit
the
property
or
risk
death
;
Grey
recalled
Gorst
to
Auckland
soon
after
.


On
4
April
Grey
arranged
for
a
300-strong
Imperial
force
to
evict
Māori
from
the
contested
Tataramaika
block
in
Taranaki
and
reoccupy
it
.


Māori
viewed
the
reoccupation
as
an
act
of
war
and
on
4
May
a
party
of
about
40
Ngati
Ruanui
warriors
carried
out
a
revenge
attack
,
ambushing
a
small
military
party
on
a
coastal
road
at
nearby
Oakura
,
killing
all
but
one
of
the
10
soldiers
.


The
ambush
,
ordered
by
Rewi
,
may
have
been
planned
as
an
assassination
attempt
on
Grey
,
who
regularly
rode
the
track
between
New
Plymouth
and
the
Tataraimaka
military
post
.


Imperial
troops
were
moved
back
to
Taranaki
as
hostilities
resumed
and
on
4
June
the
new
British
commander
,
Lieutenant-General
Duncan
Cameron
,
led
870
troops
to
attack
a
party
of
about
50
Māori
on
the
Tataraimaka
block
,
killing
24
.


Concerned
by
the
renewed
aggression
,
some
Kingites
began
resurrecting
their
plan
to
raid
Auckland
and
its
frontier
settlements
.


The
colonial
ministry
remained
unconvinced
Auckland
or
Wellington
were
in
any
danger
and
had
refused
to
call
out
the
Auckland
militia
following
the
Oakura
ambush
,
and
missionaries
and
even
Gorst
dismissed
the
likelihood
of
an
attack
.


But
in
correspondence
to
London
Grey
cited
that
incident
as
further
proof
of
the
imminent
danger
to
New
Zealand
settlers
.


On
9
July
1863
Grey
issued
a
new
ultimatum
,
ordering
that
all
Māori
living
between
Auckland
and
the
Waikato
take
an
oath
of
allegiance
to
Queen
Victoria
or
be
expelled
south
of
the
river
.


As
many
young
men
retreated
into
the
bush
with
their
weapons
,
officials
began
seizing
others—including
the
ill
and
aged—who
declined
to
swear
the
oath
,
imprisoning
them
without
charge
.


Two
days
later
Grey
issued
a
proclamation
directed
to
the
``
Chiefs
of
Waikato
''
,
which
read
:
Within
a
day—before
the
proclamation
had
even
reached
the
Waikato—Grey
ordered
the
invasion
of
the
Kingite
territory
,
claiming
he
was
making
a
punitive
expedition
against
Rewi
over
the
Oakura
ambush
and
a
pre-emptive
strike
to
thwart
a
``
determined
and
bloodthirsty
''
plot
to
attack
Auckland
.


though
grey
claimed
it
was
a
defensive
action
,
historian
b.
j.
dalton
claimed
his
reports
to
london
had
been
``
a
deliberate
and
transparent
falsehood
''
and
that
the
invasion
was
an
act
of
``
calculated
aggression
''
.


On
12
July
Duncan
Cameron
and
the
first
echelon
of
the
invading
army
crossed
the
Mangatawhiri
Stream
.

After
the
conquest
of
Kabul
,
Babur
had
imposed
a
large
contribution
of
horses
and
sheep
on
the
Sultan
Masudi
Hazaras
and
sent
collectors
to
receive
it
.


However
,
his
collectors
returned
unsuccessful
.


The
Hazaras
refused
to
pay
as
they
did
not
recognize
Babur
as
their
legitimate
sovereign
.


Several
times
before
they
had
been
guilty
of
depredations
on
the
roads
of
Ghazni
and
Gardez
.


Babur
decided
to
subdue
the
Hazaras
in
what
is
now
Maidan
Wardak
Province
of
Afghanistan
.


Babur
took
the
field
for
the
purpose
of
falling
on
them
by
surprise
and
having
advanced
by
way
of
Maidan
Shar
he
cleared
the
pass
of
Nirkh
District
by
night
and
by
the
time
of
Fajr
prayers
,
fell
upon
the
Hazaras
in
the
territory
of
Chatu
and
defeated
them
.


He
then
levied
the
taxes
on
them
and
returned
by
way
of
Sang
Surakh
.


Jahangir
Mirza

took
leave
to
go

Farhud
(
)
was
the
pogrom
or
``
violent
dispossession
''
carried
out
against
the
Jewish
population
of
Baghdad
,
Iraq
,
on
June
1–2
,
1941
,
immediately
following
the
British
victory
in
the
Anglo-Iraqi
War
.


The
riots
occurred
in
a
power
vacuum
following
the
collapse
of
the
pro-Nazi
government
of
Rashid
Ali
while
the
city
was
in
a
state
of
instability
.


The
violence
came
immediately
after
the
rapid
defeat
of
Rashid
Ali
by
British
forces
,
whose
earlier
coup
had
generated
a
short
period
of
national
euphoria
,
and
was
fueled
by
allegations
that
Iraqi
Jews
had
aided
the
British
.


over
180
jews
were
killed
and
1,000
injured
,
and
up
to
300-400
non-jewish
rioters
were
killed
in
the
attempt
to
quell
the
violence
.


Looting
of
Jewish
property
took
place
and
900
Jewish
homes
were
destroyed
.


The
Farhud
took
place
during
the
Jewish
holiday
of
Shavuot
.


It
has
been
referred
to
as
a
pogrom
which
was
part
of
the
Holocaust
,
although
such
comparison
has
been
disputed
.


It
has
also
been
called
``
the
beginning
of
the
end
of
the
Jewish
community
of
Iraq
''
,
propagating
the
migration
of
Iraqi
Jews
out
of
the
country
,
although
a
direct
connection
to
the
1951-2
Jewish
exodus
from
Iraq
is
also
disputed
,
as
many
Jews
who
left
Iraq
immediately
following
the
Farhud
returned
to
the
country
and
permanent
emigration
did
not
accelerate
significantly
until
1950-51
.


According
to
Hayyim
Cohen
,
the
Farhud
``
was
the
only
[
such
event
]
known
to
the
Jews
of
Iraq
,
at
least
during
their
last
hundred
years
of
life
there
''
.


The
Wichita
massacre
,
also
known
as
the
Wichita
horror
,
was
a
spree
of
random
robberies
,
assaults
,
rapes
,
and
murders
perpetrated
from
December
7
to
14
,
2000
by
brothers
Reginald
and
Jonathan
Carr
against
several
people
in
the
city
of
Wichita
,
Kansas
.


In
this
period
,
the
Carrs
killed
five
people
and
a
dog
in
the
course
of
robberies
and
assaults
,
robbed
another
man
,
and
severely
wounded
a
woman
.


The
crimes
shocked
Wichitans
,
and
incited
a
boom
in
sales
of
guns
,
locks
,
and
home
security
systems
.


The
brothers
were
tried
and
convicted
on
multiple
counts
,
including
for
kidnapping
,
robbery
,
rape
,
four
counts
of
capital
murder
,
and
one
count
of
first-degree
murder
.


They
were
both
sentenced
to
death
in
October
2002
.


The
case
has
continued
to
receive
attention
because
the
convicted
killers
'
sentences
have
been
subject
to
various
rulings
related
to
the
state
's
death
penalty
law
.


In
2004
,
the
Kansas
Supreme
Court
overturned
the
state
's
death
penalty
law
,
but
the
Kansas
attorney
general
appealed
to
the
U.S.
Supreme
Court
.


It
upheld
the
constitutionality
of
the
state
's
death
penalty
law
;
this
meant
that
the
Carrs
and
other
condemned
killers
were
returned
to
death
row
.


defense
attorneys
continued
appeals
.


On
July
25
,
2014
,
the
Kansas
Supreme
Court
overturned
the
death
sentences
against
the
Carrs
because
of
trial
judge
error
in
the
penalty
proceedings
.


A
penalty
trial
is
required
for
each
of
the
brothers
.


Before
this
occurred
,
the
state
attorney
general
appealed
its
high
court
's
decision
to
the
US
Supreme
Court
,
which
agreed
in
March
2015
to
hear
the
case
.


In
January
2016
,
the
United
States
Supreme
Court
overturned
the
decision
of
the
Kansas
Supreme
Court
and
reinstated
the
death
sentences
.


Both
Carr
brothers
are
currently
incarcerated
at
El

Correctional
Facility
in

The
Boxer
Rebellion
(
)
,
Boxer
Uprising
,
or
Yihetuan
Movement
(
)
was
an
anti-imperialist
,
anti-foreign
,
and
anti-Christian
uprising
that
took
place
in
China
between
1899
and
1901
,
toward
the
end
of
the
Qing
dynasty
.


It
was
initiated
by
the
Militia
United
in
Righteousness
(
``
Yihetuan
''
)
,
known
in
English
as
the
``
Boxers
''
,
for
many
of
their
members
had
been
practitioners
of
Chinese
martial
arts
,
also
referred
to
in
the
west
as
``
Chinese
Boxing
''
.


The
uprising
took
place
against
a
background
that
included
severe
drought
and
disruption
caused
by
the
growth
of
foreign
spheres
of
influence
in
China
.


After
several
months
of
growing
violence
in
Shandong
and
the
North
China
plain
against
the
foreign
and
Christian
presence
in
June
1900
,
Boxer
fighters
,
convinced
they
were
invulnerable
to
foreign
weapons
,
converged
on
Beijing
with
the
slogan
``
Support
the
Qing
government

exterminate
the

issued
an
Imperial
Decree
declaring

.


diplomats
,
foreign
civilians
,
and

were
besieged
for
55
days
by
the
imperial
army
of

.


Chinese
officialdom
was
split
between
those
supporting
the
Boxers
and
those
favoring
conciliation
,
led
by
Prince
Qing
.


The
supreme
commander
of
the
Chinese
forces
,
the
Manchu
General
Ronglu
(
Junglu
)
,
later
claimed
he
acted
to
protect
the
foreigners
.


Officials
in
the
Mutual
Protection
of
Southeast
China
refused
the
imperial
order
to
fight
against
foreigners
.


The
Eight-Nation
Alliance
,
after
being
initially
turned
back
,
brought
20,000
armed
troops
to
China
,
defeated
the
Imperial
Army
,
and
arrived
at
Peking
on
August14
,
relieving
the
siege
of

of
the
capital

along
with
the
summary

proposed
role
for
the
republic
of
ireland
's
government
in
running
northern
ireland
the
strike
was
organised
and
overseen
by
the
ulster
workers
'
council
and
ulster
army
council
,
which
were
formed
shortly
after
the
agreement
's
signing
.


both
of
these
groups
included
ulster
loyalist
paramilitaries
such
as
the
ulster
defence
association
(
uda
)
and
ulster
volunteer
force
(
uvf
)
.


These
groups
helped
to
enforce
the
strike
by
blocking
roads
and
intimidating
workers
.


During
the
two-week
strike
,
loyalist
paramilitaries
killed
39
civilians
,
of
whom
33
died
in
the
Dublin
and
Monaghan
bombings
.


the
strike
succeeded
in
bringing
down
the
power-sharing
northern
ireland
assembly
and
executive
.


Responsibility
for
the
government
of
Northern
Ireland
then
reverted
to
the
Parliament
of
the
United
Kingdom
at
Westminster
under
the
arrangements
for
'Direct
Rule
'
.


The
successful
strike
was
later
described
by
the
then
Secretary
of
State
for
Northern
Ireland
,
Merlyn
Rees
,
as
an
``
outbreak
of
Ulster
nationalism
''
.


The
Action
of
1
March
1968
refers
to
a
co-ordinated
attempt
by
four
North
Vietnamese
trawlers
to
resupply
the
Viet
Cong
and
the
efforts
of
Operation
Market
Time
elements
to
stop
them
during
the
Vietnam
War
.


On
28
February
1968
,
United
States
Navy
SP-2H
Neptune
aircraft
on
routine
patrol
detected
a
North
Vietnamese
SL
class
naval
trawler
heading
towards
the
South
Vietnamese
coast
from
north
of
the
DMZ
.


By
the
next
morning
,
three
more
trawlers
were
discovered
and
units
of
Operation
Market
Time
were
deployed
for
a
surprise
interception
.


The
suspect
trawlers
did
not
fly
flags
so
it
was
not
until
the
start
of
the
engagement
that
their
origin
was
discovered
.


The
trawlers
were
steel
hulled
vessels
,
100
feet
long
and
armed
with
57-millimeter
recoilless
rifles
and
machine
guns
.


All
four
vessels
were
loaded
with
weapons
and
ammunition
intended
to
be
delivered
to
the
Viet
Cong
.


American
and
South
Vietnamese
forces
that
engaged
in
action
included
the
United
States
Coast
Guard
cutters
,
,
,
,
,
,
,
the
swift
boats
,
,
,
,
,
and
,
two
South
Vietnamese
navy
junks
and
one
patrol
boat
.


Two
U.S.
Army
helicopter
gunships
also
participated
in
combat
as
well
as
aircraft
used
to
fire
flares
.


the
1991
yugoslav
campaign
in
croatia
was
a
series
of
engagements
between
the
yugoslav
people
's
army
(
jna
)
,
the
yugoslav
navy
and
the
yugoslav
air
force
,
and
the
croatian
national
guard
(
zng
)
then
the
croatian
army
(
hv
)
during
the
croatian
war
of
independence
.


The
JNA
was
originally
deployed
in
order
to
preserve
Yugoslavia
,
and
the
initial
plan
of
the
campaign
entailed
the
military
occupation
of
Croatia
and
the
removal
of
the
Croatian
leadership
elected
in
1990
.


The
JNA
intervention
was
the
culmination
of
its
involvement
in
the
confiscation
of
weapons
from
Croatia
's
Territorial
Defence
,
and
in
the
Croatian
Serb
revolt
that
had
begun
in
August
1990
.


From
that
time
,
the
JNA
had
been
frequently
deployed
to
form
a
buffer
zone
between
the
insurgents
and
the
ZNG
or
the
Croatian
police
.


In
effect
,
these
JNA
buffer
zones
often
secured
the
territorial
gains
of
the
insurgents
and
led
to
an
increasingly
hostile
relationship
between
the
JNA
and
Croatia
.


The
JNA
campaign
plan
was
amended
shortly
before
the
campaign
to
include
the
relief
of
JNA
barracks
besieged
by
the
ZNG
.


The
besieging
and
subsequent
capture
of
several
JNA
facilities
allowed
Croatia
to
arm
its
previously
poorly
equipped
military
and
to
equip
new
recruits
.


The
campaign
effectively
started
on
20
September
1991
,
even
though
relatively
minor
offensive
actions
had
already
been
undertaken
.


By
the
end
of
the
month
,
it
suffered
from
serious
delays
and
manpower
shortages
caused
by
low
call-up
turnout
in
Serbia
.


In
early
October
,
the
original
campaign
objectives
were
reduced
as
Serbian
president
Slobodan
Milošević
and
his
allies
gained
greater
control
of
the
JNA
.


Subsequently
,
the
campaign
objectives
were
redefined
to
deny
the
Croatian
Government
access
to
parts
of
Croatia
that
contained
substantial
Serb
populations
and
to
protect
Croatian
Serbs
.


The
campaign
culminated
in
late
November
and
early
December
with
the
Battle
of
Vukovar
and
the
Siege
of
Dubrovnik
.


A
limited
Croatian
counterattack
and
the
development
of
the
HV
led
to
a
stalemate
on
the
battlefield
.


The
strategic
situation
permitted
the
development
of
the
Vance
plan—a
ceasefire
supervised
by
United
Nations
peacekeepers
designed
to
create
conditions
for
the
political
settlement
of
the
conflict
in
Croatia
.


the
sarajevo
agreement
,
regarding
the
implementation
of
the
ceasefire
,
was
signed
on
2
january
1992
,
bringing
the
campaign
to
an
end
.


Nonetheless
,
the
JNA
took
several
more
months
to
withdraw
from
Croatia
as
it
was
replaced
by
the
UN
peacekeepers
.


In
1991
alone
,
the
conflict
caused
more
than
7,000
deaths
and
the
internal
displacement
of
400,000–600,000
people
.


More
than
1,700
persons
remain
missing
as
a
result
of
the
campaign
.


tropical
storm
norman
was
the
fourteenth
tropical
cyclone
of
the
2012
pacific
hurricane
season
that
brought
minor
flooding
to
western
mexico
and
record
rainfall
to
areas
of
texas
in
september
2012
.


Originating
from
a
disturbance
near
the
southern
tip
of
Baja
California
,
it
soon
moves
north
and
developed
into
a
tropical
cyclone
on
September
28
.


upon
developing
into
one
,
norman
attained
its
peak
intensity
with
maximum
sustained
winds
of
50
mph
(
85
km/h
)
.


Heading
northward
into
the
Gulf
of
California
,
the
storm
began
to
weaken
later
that
day
due
to
southwesterly
wind
shear
and
land
interaction
.


Norman
curved
northwestward
and
weakened
to
a
tropical
depression
early
on
September
29
.


Around
that
time
,
it
briefly
moved
inland
near
Topolobampo
,
Sinaloa
,
before
re-emerging
into
the
Gulf
of
California
.


Later
on
September
29
,
Norman
degenerated
into
a
remnant
low
pressure
area
.


In
anticipation
of
the
storm
,
a
tropical
storm
warning
was
issued
for
a
portion
of
the
Pacific
coast
of
Mexico
.


Additionally
,
orange
,
yellow
,
green
,
and
blue
alerts
were
posted
for
several
states
.


About
553
shelters
were
opened
,
though
only
65
people
sought
refuge
in
them
.


Heavy
rainfall
from
Norman
was
reported
in
Colima
,
Jalisco
,
Nayarit
,
Sinaloa
,
Baja
California
Sur
,
Durango
,
and
Zacatecas
.


In
Baja
California
Sur
,
mudslides
and
flooding
left
roads
impassable
,
mainly
in
the
La
Paz
area
.


Flooding
in
Sinola
left
streets
inundated
and
about
150
families
fled
their
homes
.


About
24
cars
in
the
area
were
swept
away
.


The
remnants
of
Norman
brought
record
rainfall
totals
to
some
areas
of
Texas
.


Local
flooding
occurred
,
with
a
few
roads
inundated
in
Wimberley
.


A
woman
died
after
her
vehicle
was
swept
off

Fall
Brawl
was
an
annual
professional
wrestling
pay-per-view
(
PPV
)
event
produced
by
World
Championship
Wrestling
(
WCW
)
and
was
held
in
September
from
1993
through
2000
.


The
name
was
derived
from
the
fall
edition
of
``

of
the
Champions
''
,
called
``
Fall
Brawl
''
,
in
1988
,

,
1990
,
and
1991
.


There
was
no
Fall
Brawl
event
held
in
1992
.


It
was
considered
by
many
as
WCW
's
answer
to
the
World
Wrestling
Federation
's
annual
Survivor
Series
pay-per-view
event
due
to
the
main
event
WarGames
match
held
during
most
of
the
Fall

shows
.


World
Wrestling
Entertainment
have
owned
the
rights
to

since
they
purchased
WCW
in
March
2001
and
although
they
have
not
produced
the
event
under
the
main
banner
,
Ohio
Valley
Wrestling
did
use
the
``
Fall
Brawl
''
name
during
the
time
it
was
a
WWE
development
territory
.


In
2014
,
All

,
Pakistan
,
in
which
17
people
were

occurred
at
the
five-star
Pearl

in
the
city
.


The
force
of
the
explosion
caused
the
hotel
to
partially
collapse
.


Gunman
also
attacked
the
hotel
,
firing
several
shots
at
survivors
.


The
United

had
planned
to
purchase
this
hotel
to
convert
it
to
a
consulate
.


Malik
Naveed
,
a
provincial
police
chief
,
stated
that
at

but
that
the
death
toll
was
likely
to
rise
.


at
least
46
others
have
been
injured
.


Other

gave
tolls
of

MidPoint
Music
Festival
(
MPMF
)
launched
in
2001
in
Cincinnati
,
Ohio
,
as
an
independent
music
festival
and
industry
conference
and
was
last
held
in
2017
.


The
annual
three-day
event
took
place
in
September
in
the
city
's
downtown
and
historic
Over-the-Rhine
entertainment
district
.


Founded
by
Cincinnati
musicians
Bill
Donabedian
and
Sean
Rhiney
,
the
festival
was
acquired
in
2008
by
Cincinnati
CityBeat
,
a
weekly
alternative
newspaper
.


The
festival
did
expand
since
CityBeat
acquired
it
.


The
estimated
attendance
in
2008
was
13,500
.


This
doubled
to
27,000
people
in
2012
.


This
is
partly
due
to
the
larger
bands
booked
and
the
large
outdoor
space
available
for
headliners
at
the
newly
renovated
Washington
Park
in
Over-the-Rhine
.


though
the
festival
used
to
take
place
in
various
locations
throughout
the
greater
cincinnati
region
(
including
one
venue
in
newport
,
ky
)
,
it
became
located
mostly
in
the
downtown
area
and
over-the-rhine
,
a
burgeoning
arts
district
just
north
of
the
downtown
cincinnati
business
district
.


the
action
of
15
july
1798
was
a
minor
naval
battle
of
the
french
revolutionary
wars
,
fought
off
the
spanish
mediterranean
coast
by
the
royal
navy
ship
of
the
line
hms
``
lion
''
under
captain
manley
dixon
and
a
squadron
of
four
spanish
navy
frigates
under
commodore
don
felix
o'neil
.


``
Lion
''
was
one
of
several
ships
sent
into
the
Western
Mediterranean
by
Vice-Admiral
Earl
St
Vincent
,
commander
of
the
British
Mediterranean
Fleet
based
at
the
Tagus
in
Portugal
during
the
late
spring
of
1798
.


The
Spanish
squadron
was
a
raiding
force
that
had
sailed
from
Cartagena
in
Murcia
seven
days
earlier
,
and
was
intercepted
while
returning
to
its
base
after
an
unsuccessful
cruise
.


although
together
the
spanish
vessels
outweighed
the
british
ship
,
individually
they
were
weaker
and
commodore
o'neil
failed
to
ensure
that
his
unk
were
co-ordinated
.


As
a
result
,
one
of
the
frigates
,
``
Santa
Dorotea
''
,
fell
out
of
the
line
of
battle
and
was
attacked
by
``
Lion
''
.


Despite
ineffectual
long-range
gunfire
towards
the
British
ship
by
the
remainder
of
the
Spanish
squadron
,
the
isolated
``
Santa
Dorotea
''
was
rapidly
forced
to
surrender
,
O'Neil
eventually
turning
the
other
three
frigates
back
towards
Cartagena
.


Unopposed
,
Dixon
was
able
to
consolidate
his
prize
and
send
it
to
St
Vincent
's
fleet
off
Cadiz
,
where
it
was
subsequently
purchased
into
the
Royal
Navy
.


``
Lion
''
remained
in
the
Mediterranean
during
the
year
,
later
participating
in
the
blockades
of
Malta
and
Alexandria
.


The
Spanish
,
their
seaports
carefully
guarded
by
Royal
Navy
squadrons
,
launched
no
further
expeditions
into
the
Mediterranean
during
the
year
.

.


Conceived
and
created
in
1991
by
Jane
's
Addiction
singer
Perry
Farrell
as
a
farewell
tour
for
his
band
,
Lollapalooza
ran
annually
until
1997
,
and
was
revived
in
2003
.


From
its
inception
through
1997
and
its
revival
in
2003
,
the
festival
toured
North
America
.


In
2004
,
the
festival
organizers
decided
to
expand
the
dates
to
two
days
per
city
,
but
poor
ticket
sales
forced
the
2004
tour
to
be
cancelled
.


In
2005
,
Farrell
and
the
William
Morris
Agency
partnered
with
Austin
,
Texas–based
company
Capital
Sports
Entertainment
(
now
C3
Presents
)
and
retooled
it
into
its
current
format
as
a
weekend
destination
festival
in
Chicago
at
Grant
Park
.


In
2014
,
Live
Nation
Entertainment
bought
a
controlling
interest
in
C3
Presents
.


In
2010
it
was
announced
that
Lollapalooza
would
remain
in
Chicago
while
also
debuting
outside
the
United
States
,
with
a
branch
of
the
festival
staged
in
Chile
's
capital
Santiago
on
April
2–3
,
2011
where
they
partnered
up
with
Santiago-based

based
on
local
musicians
from
the
town
Menzel
was
in
.


The
tour
also
included
her
Carnegie
Hall
debut
in
early
2013
.


It
was
originally
set
to
take
place
in
October
2012
,
but
was
delayed
due
to
Hurricane
Sandy
.


The
Siege
of
Barcelona
took
place
between
3
and
27
April
1706
during
the
War
of
the
Spanish
Succession
when
a
Franco-Spanish
army
laid
siege
to
Barcelona
in
an
attempt
to
recapture
the
city
following
its
fall
to
an
English-led
Allied
army
the
previous
year
.


After
the
Earl
of
Peterborough
entered
Valencia
in
triumph
in
January
of
1706
,
Barcelona
was
left
vulnerable
.


This
led
the
French
to
change
the
plans
of
attacking
Valencia
and
try
to
besiege
Barcelona
instead
,
while
the
city
was
blocked
from
the
sea-side
by
the
Count
of
Toulouse
.


The
Spanish
forces
were
led
by
Philip
V
,
while
René
de
Froulay
,
Comte
de
Tessé
was
placed
in
charge
of
the
French
land
forces
during
the
siege
.


Despite
insufficient
artillery
and
the
constant
harassment
from
Peterborough
,
who
marched
north
with
3000
men
and
attacked
the
besiegers
from
the
mountains
,
the
Franco-Spanish
forces
finally
managed
to
shoot
three
breaches
in
the
walls
.


But
before
the
decision
to
storm
the
city
could
be
made
,
the
siege
was
abandoned
,
following
the
appearance
of
a
large
English
fleet
under
the
command
of
John
Leake
carrying
reinforcements
.


The
Franco-Spanish
army
abandoned
its
supplies
and
artillery
in
its
hasty
retreat
.


Phillip
was
cut
off
from
returning
to
Madrid
,
and
so
he
crossed
into
France
.


Barcelona
and
the
entire
region
of
Catalonia
remained
in
Allied
hands
until
1714
.


from
1951
to
1966
the
united
states
air
force
deployed
thousands
of
personnel
and
hundreds
of
combat
aircraft
to
france
to
counter
the
buildup
of
the
soviet
armed
forces
in
eastern
europe
.


The
Cold
War
escalated
into
the
attempted
seizure
of
West
Berlin
during
1948
.


This
convinced
the
western
nations
to
form
a
common
defense
organization
.


discussions
led
to
the
north
atlantic
treaty
organization
.


NATO
's
defense
strategy
came
to
incorporate
land
,
sea
,
and
air
forces
.


Due
to
the
vulnerability
of
West
Germany
to
Soviet
attack
,
USAF
planners
did
not
want
any
new
tactical
air
units
moved
into
the
U.S
.


Zone
of
Occupation
there
.


By
1950
,
the
United
States
Air
Forces
in
Europe
(
USAFE
)
wanted
all
tactical
air
units
to
be
located
west
of
the
Rhine
River
to
provide
greater
air
defense
warning
time
.


France
agreed
to
provide
air
base
sites
.


between
1950
and
1967
the
united
states
air
force
operated
11
major
air
bases
in
france
.


They
were
:
There
were
other
communications
sites
,
NATO
Dispersed
Operating
Bases
,
Sub-Depots
and
minor
facilities
at
several
French
Airports
,
such
as
Orly
Airport
and
Marseille
Provence
Airport
which
are
not
shown
on
this
map
.


The
United
States
Army
also
established
a
significant
presence
in
France
,
and
was
responsible
for
much
air
base
construction
and
maintenance
.


the
first
nato
tenant
in
france
was
the
unk
air
base

of
the
usaf
military
air
transport
service
,
activated
in
june
1950
at
paris

base
.


On
28
February
1958
the
official
name
of
Orly
Air
Base
was
changed
to
Orly
Airport
and
most
MATS
flights
were
routed
to
Chateauroux
Air
Depot
.


after
15
years
of
u.s.
air
force
presence
,
french
president
charles
de
gaulle
decided
to
evict
nato
forces
from
france
.


On
7
March
1966
,
he
announced
that
France
would
withdraw
from
NATO
's
integrated
military
structure
.


He
gave
NATO
forces
one

to
depart
France

the
state
department
,
the
united

department
of
defense
,
and
air

carefully
managed
the
news
about
the
american
departure
from
france
,
and
the
attendant
problems
of
an
integrated
nato
air
defense
for
western
europe
and
the
decrease
in
tactical
airpower
.


Due
to
the
U.S.
media
focus
on
the
Vietnam
War
,
the
removal
of
NATO
forces
from
France
went
virtually
unreported
in
the
US
.


During
1966-67
all
USAF
offices
and
facilities
in
France
were
closed
and
personnel
and
equipment
moved
.


The
last
USAFE
activities
were
the
1630th
Air
Base
Squadron
at
Orly
Airport
and
the
Paris
Administration
Office
.


Both
were
closed
in
June
1967
.


On
23
October
1967
,
all
foreign
flags
were
furled
and
after
17
years
the
last
NATO
forces
departed
France
.


Today
most
of
the
old
USAF
air
bases
in
France
are
being
used
by
the
French

and
are

The
sinking
of
``
Sewol
(
)
,
also
called
the
Sewol
''
ferry
disaster
,
occurred
on
the
morning
of
16
April
2014
,
when
the
passenger/ro-ro
ferry
was
en
route
from
Incheon
towards
Jeju
in
South
Korea
.


The
6,825-ton
vessel
sent
a
distress
signal
from
about
north
of
Byeongpungdo
at
08:58
KST
(
23:58

)
.


Out
of
476
passengers
and
crew
,
304
died
in
the
disaster
,
most
notably
around
250
students
from
Danwon
High
School
(
Ansan
City
)
.


Of
the
approximately
172
survivors
,
more
than
half
were
rescued
by
fishing
boats
and
other
commercial
vessels
that
arrived
at
the
scene
approximately
40
minutes
after
the
Korea
Coast
Guard
.


The
sinking
of
``
MV
Sewol
''
resulted
in
widespread
social
and
political
reaction
within
South
Korea
.


Many
criticized
the
actions
of
the
captain
and
most
of
the
crew
.


Also
criticized
were
the
ferry
operator
and
the
regulators
who
oversaw
its
operations
,
along
with
the
administration
of
President
Park
Geun-hye
for
its
disaster
response
(
including
the
poor
showing
of
the
coast
guard
)
and
attempts
to
downplay
government
culpability
.


On
15
May
2014
,
the
captain
and
three
crew
members
were
charged
with
murder
,
while
the
other
eleven
members
of
the
crew
were
indicted
for
abandoning
the
ship
.


An
arrest
warrant
was
also
issued
for
Yoo
Byung-eun
,
the
owner
of
Chonghaejin
Marine
,
which
operated
``
Sewol

,
but
he
could
not
be
found
despite
a
nationwide
manhunt

revealed
that
they

The
National
Multicultural
Festival
is
a

community
festival
held
annually
each

was
held
in
1981
as
a
one-day
event
on
Australia

hosted
by
the
ACT
Ethnic

Council
.


In
1996
the
National
Multicultural

in
Canberra
officially
came
into
being
.


It
began
as
a
nod
to
the
Capital

by
young
families
with
links
across
the

,
and
blossomed
throughout
the

and
early
2000s
to
an
event
reflecting
the
more
than
170
unique
nationalities
that
comprise
our
population
.


The
festival
has
become
one
of
the
most
successful
multicultural
festivals
in
Australia
.


The
festival
is
held
over
three
days
during

NATO-led
coalition
began
a
military
intervention

ostensibly
to

the
resolution
was
taken
in
response
to
events
during

civil
war

military
operations
began

Despite
the
use

,
the
intervention
did
not
consist

The
Libyan
government
response
to

campaign
was
totally
ineffectual
,
with
Gaddafi

forces
not
managing

shoot
down

Italy
initially
opposed
the
intervention
but
then
offered
to
take
part
in
the
operations
on
the
condition
that
NATO
took
the
leadership
of
the
mission
instead
of
individual
countries
(
particularly
France
)
.


As
this
condition
was
later
met
,
Italy
shared
its
bases
and
intelligence
with
the
allies
.


From
the
beginning
of
the
intervention
,
the
initial
coalition
of
Belgium
,
Canada
,
Denmark
,
France
,
Italy
,
Norway
,
Qatar
,
Spain
,
UK

expanded
to
nineteen
states
,
with
newer
states
mostly
enforcing
the
no-fly
zone
and
naval
blockade
or
providing
military
logistical
assistance
.


The
effort
was
initially
largely
led
by
France
and
the
United
Kingdom
,
with
command
shared
with
the
United
States
.


NATO
took
control
of
the

on
23

named
Operation
Unified
Protector

unify
the
military

campaign
(
whilst
keeping

control
with

)
,
first
failed
over
objections
by
the
French
,
German
,
and
Turkish
governments
.


On
24
March
,
NATO
agreed
to
take
control
of
the
no-fly
zone
,
while
command
of
targeting
ground
units
remains
with

The
handover
occurred
on

at
06:00
UTC
(

NATO
flew
26,500
sorties
since
it
took
charge
of
the
Libya
mission
on
31
March
2011

Fighting
in
Libya
ended
in
late
October
following
the
death
of

Gaddafi
,
and
NATO
stated
it
would
end
operations
over
Libya
on

The
1991
uprisings
in
Iraq
were
a
series
of
popular
rebellions
in
northern
and
southern
Iraq
in
March
and
April
1991
in
a
ceasefire
of
the
Persian
Gulf
War
.


The
mostly
uncoordinated
insurgency
,
often
referred
to
as
the
Sha'aban
Intifada
among
Arabs
and
as
the
National
Uprising
among
Kurds
,
was
fueled
by
the
perception
that
then
Iraqi
President
Saddam
Hussein
was
responsible
for
systemic
social
repression
and
had
become
vulnerable
to
regime
change
.


This
perception
of
weakness
was
largely
the
result
of
the
outcome
of
two
prior
wars
:
the
Iran–Iraq
War
and
the
invasion
of
Kuwait
,
both
of
which
occurred
within
a
single
decade
and
devastated
the
economy
and
population
of
Iraq
.


Within
the
first
two
weeks
,
most
of
Iraq
's
cities
and
provinces
fell
to
rebel
forces
.


Participants
of
the
uprising
were
a
diverse
mix
of
ethnic
,
religious
and
political
affiliations
,
including
military
mutineers
,
Shia
Arab
Islamists
,
Kurdish
nationalists
,
and
far-left
groups
.


Following
initial
victories
,
the
revolution
was
held
back
from
continued
success
by
internal
divisions
as
well
as
a
lack
of
anticipated
American
support
.


saddam
's
sunni
unk
ba'ath
party
regime
managed
to
maintain
control
over
the
capital
of
baghdad
and
soon
largely
suppressed
the
rebels
in
a
brutal
campaign
conducted
by
loyalist
forces
spearheaded
by
the
iraqi
republican
guard
.


During
the
brief
,
roughly
one-month
period
of
unrest
,
tens
of
thousands
of
people
died
and
nearly
two
million
people
were
displaced
.


After
the
conflict
,
the
Iraqi
government
intensified
a
prior
systematic
forced
relocation
of
Marsh
Arabs
and
the
draining
of
the
Mesopotamian
Marshes
in
the
Tigris–Euphrates
river
system
.


The
Persian
Gulf
War
Coalition
established
Iraqi
no-fly
zones
over
northern
and
southern
Iraq
,
and
the
Kurdish
opposition
established
the
Kurdish
Autonomous
Republic
in
what
is
now
commonly
referred
to
as
Iraqi
Kurdistan
.


the
murphy
complex
fire
was
a
2007
wildfire
that
included
acreage
upon
the
bureau
of
land
management
(
blm
)
bruneau
and
jarbidge
field
offices
of
idaho
,
blm
elko
field
office
of
nevada
,
and
forest
service
mountain
city
and
jarbidge
districts
of
nevada
.


It
burned
an
estimated
of
land
.


By
acreage
,
it
was
the
third
largest
wildfire
in
the
United
States
between
1997
and
2009
.


The
fire
affected
Owyhee
and
Twin
Falls
counties
in
Idaho
,
and
Elko
County
,
Nevada
.


Nearly
three
times
as
much
acreage
burned
in
the
two
Idaho
counties
as
burned
in
Nevada
.


Aerial
crews
were
primarily
responsible
for
fighting
the
fire
in
Castleford
,
Idaho
.


About
560
wildfire
firefighters
were
involved
including
a
Type
1
team
that
specializes
in
fighting
large
wildfires
.


This
was
the
third
large
fire
in
as
many
years
on
land
managed
by
the
Jarbidge
Field
Office
in
Idaho
's
Twin
Falls
District
.


Because
of
this
,
the
BLM
held
a
workshop
on
large
wildfires
in
the
district
on
May
12–14
,
2009
.


The
fire
was
a
combination
of
six
wildfires
caused
by
lightning
in
south-central
Idaho
and
north-central
Nevada
that
started
on
July
16–17
,
2007
.


The
four
largest
fires
were
called
the
Rowland
,
Elk
Mountain
,
Smith
Crossing
and
Buck
Flat
fires
.


they
merged
over
the
weekend
of
july
21
,
2007
,
and
the
wildfire
was
renamed
the
murphy
complex
fire
.


It
spread
quickly
due
to
the
hot
and
dry
conditions
and
threatened
or
damaged
a
wide
variety
of
natural
resources
,
plants
,
animals
,
people
and
property
.


By
the
time
it
was
contained
on
August
2
,
2007
an
estimated
in
Idaho
and
in
Nevada
had
burned
.


It
was
the
largest
Idaho
wildfire
since
1910
.


Afterward
,
the
BLM
undertook
a
large
scale
reclamation
effort
,
which
included
fencing
,
seedling
planting
,
shrub
planting
,
drill
seeding
,
aerial
seeding
,
cultural
inventory
,
weed
treatment
and
monitoring
.


Monitoring
is
planned
for
.


Total
reclamation
costs
are
estimated
at
over
$
11
million
during
fiscal
years
2007–2010
,
with
full
recovery
of
the
natural
systems
taking
several
additional
years
.


Roquebert
's
expedition
to
the
Caribbean
,
was
an
unsuccessful
operation
by
a
French
naval
squadron
to
transport
supplies
to
Guadeloupe
in
December
1809
at
the
height
of
the
Napoleonic
Wars
.


over
the
previous
year
,
british
royal
navy
squadrons
had
isolated
and
defeated
the
french
caribbean
colonies
one
by
one
,
until
by
the
autumn
guadeloupe
was
the
only
colony
remaining
in
french
hands
.


Cut
off
from
the
rest
of
the
world
by
British
blockade
squadrons
that
intercepted
all
ships
coming
to
or
from
the
island
,
Guadeloupe
was
in
a
desperate
situation
,
facing
economic
collapse
,
food
shortages
and
social
upheaval
,
as
well
as
the
impending
threat
of
British
invasion
.


In
an
effort
to
reinforce
and
resupply
the
colony
,
the
French
government
sent
four
vessels
to
the
West
Indies
in
November
1809
under
Commodore
François
Roquebert
.


Two
of
the
ships
were
20-gun
flûtes
carrying
supplies
and
troops
.


The
two
others
were
40-gun
frigates
,
ordered
to
protect
the
storeships
on
their
journey
from
the
British
forces
operating
off
both
the
French
and
Guadeloupe
coasts
.


The
squadron
almost
reached
the
Caribbean
without
encountering
any
of
patrolling
British
warships
sent
to
watch
for
French
reinforcements
,
but
was
spotted
and
intercepted
by
the
frigate
on
13
December
.


``
Junon
''
s
captain
did
not
realise
the
size
of
the
French
squadron
until
it
was
too
late
and
,
despite
fierce
resistance
,
his
ship
was
captured
and
he
was
mortally
wounded
.


Continuing
with
the
mission
,
Roquebert
successfully
delivered
the
flûtes
``
Loire
and
``
Seine
to
within
sight
of
Guadeloupe
and
then
left
them
,
his
frigates
making
their
way
back
to
France
without
ensuring
the
safe
arrival
of
their
convoy
.


On
15
December
,
the
small
British
brig
HMS
``
Observateur
''
,
which
had
witnessed
the
defeat
of
``
Junon
''
,
brought
news
of
the
French
arrival
to
the
blockade
squadron
anchored
off
Basse-Terre
.


Summoning
ships
from
the
surrounding
region
,
the
British
commander
,
Captain
Volant
Vashon
Ballard
amassed
a
significant
squadron
and
forced
the
French
flûtes
to
anchor
in
a
protected
bay
at
Anse
à
la
Barque
,
on
the
southeastern
coast
of
Guadeloupe
.


Ineffectual
efforts
were
made
to
capture
the
flûtes
,
but
it
was
not
until
the
arrival
of
the
74-gun
under
Captain
Samuel
James
Ballard
that
an
attack
was
made
in
earnest
.


As
small
ships
engaged
the
batteries
on
shore
,
two
frigates
entered
the
bay
and
attacked
the
flûtes
,
causing
both
to
surrender
in
an
hour-long
engagement
.


Both
French
ships
were
badly
damaged
and
a
fire
started
during
the
engagement
was
able
to
rapidly
spread
through
them
,
destroying
both
ships
in
succession
.


Many
of
the
French
crew
escaped
ashore
from
the
wrecks
,
while
others
were
picked
up
by
British
ships
.


The
blockade
of
Guadeloupe
was
successfully
maintained
,
and
the
island
was
captured
in
a
coordinated
invasion
a
month
later
.


Roquebert
's
remaining
ships
were
intercepted
on
16
January
by
a
patrolling
British
frigate
,
but
successfully
escaped
pursuit
and
eventually
returned
undamaged
to
France
.


The
Burkinabé
uprising
was
a
series
of
demonstrations
and
riots
in
Burkina
Faso
in
October
2014
that
quickly
spread
to
multiple
cities
.


They
began
in
response
to
attempts
at
changing
the
constitution
to
allow
President
Blaise
Compaoré
to
run
again
and
extend
his
27
years
in
office
.


Pressure
for
political
change
came
from
civil
society
and
in
particular
from
the
country
’
s
youth
.


following
a
tumultuous
day
on
30
october
,
which
included
the
involvement
of
former
defence
minister
unk
unk
and
the
burning
of
the
national
assembly
and
other
government
buildings
as
well
as
the
ruling
congress
for
democracy
and
progress
party
's
headquarters
,
UNK
dissolved
the
government
and
declared
a
state
of
emergency
before
eventually
fleeing
to
UNK
d'ivoire
with
the
support
of
president
alassane
ouattara
.


General
Honoré
Nabéré
Traoré
announced
that
a
transitional
government
would
run
the
country
until
an
election
within
12
months
.


After
another
day
of
mass
protests
and
initially
refusing
to
resign
,
after
mounting
domestic
pressure
Compaoré
resigned
from
his
27-year
presidency
on
31
October
and
Traoré
took
over
as
the
interim
head
of
state
.


However
,
Lieutenant
Colonel
Yacouba
Isaac
Zida
also
staked
a
claim
to
be
interim
head
of
state
citing
Traoré
's
unpopularity
.


A
statement
by
military
chiefs
asserted
that
Zida
had
their
unanimous
backing
.


A
coalition
of
unnamed
opposition
parties
rejected
the
military
takeover
.


Further
protests
were
called
for
the
morning
of
2
November
,
but
were
smaller
yet
there
was
at
least
one
casualty
amidst
a
police
response
.


The
African
Union
gave
the
country
a
fortnight
to
end
military
rule
from
3
November
.


By
mid-November
,
a
framework
was
agreed
upon
unanimously
for
a
transitional
executive
and
legislative
administration
.


The
Metamorfosis
World
Tour
was
a
worldwide
concert
tour
by
Guatemalan
singer–songwriter
Ricardo
Arjona
in
support
of
his
thirteenth
studio
album
,
``
Independiente
''
.


Beginning
in
January
2012
,
it
was
Arjona
's
first
tour
since
leaving
Warner
Music
to
become
an
independent
artist
.


The
tour
was
announced
in
December
2011
with
dates
at
American
,
Argentinian
and
Chilean
venues
,
and
received
a
positive
critical
response
.


The
show
was
designed
for
a
revolving
stage
,
with
Arjona
performing
while
the
scenery
changed
with
the
songs
being
performed
.


Four
changes
of
scenery
were
developed
:
a
two-floor
apartment
,
a
bar
,
a
circus
and
a
theatre
.


The
number
of
songs
played
at
each
show
varied
from
19
to
23
.


The
tour
broke
several
records
.


In
Buenos
Aires
it
was
the
best-attended
show
ever
at
Velez
Stadium
,
attracting
a
total
audience
of
more
than
160,000
.


In
Guatemala
City
,
Arjona
became
the
first
artist
with
two
consecutive
sold-out
concerts
at
the
Mateo
Flores
Stadium
.


The
tour
was
seen
by
more
than
two
million
people
in
twenty
countries
.


Most
songs
performed
were
from
``
Independiente
''
,
and
fellow
Guatemalan
singer–songwriter
Gaby
Moreno
joined
Arjona
for
``
Fuiste
Tú
''
.


The
Metamorfosis
World
Tour
followed
Arjona
's
Quinto
Piso
Tour
(
one
of
the
most
successful
tours
by
a
Latin
artist
,
with
a
total
attendance
of
over
one
million
in
19
countries
)
.


The
2009
European
Track
Championships
were
the
European
Championship
for
track
cycling
,
for
junior
and
under
23
riders
.


They
took
place
in
Minsk
,
Belarus
from
15
July
to
19
July
2009
.


2009
was
the
final
year
this
event
was
held
for
junior
and
under-23
riders
.


Following
a
widescale
redesign
of
European
track
cycling
by
the
UEC
,
an
event
under
the
same
name
,
but
for
elite
cyclists
,
was
held
from
2010
.


In
addition
,
a
new
competition
,
explicitly
named
the
European
Track
Championships
for
under-23
and
Juniors
,
was
held
from
2010
in
a
separate
event
.


2009
European
Track
Championships
in
Belgium

The
men

's
omnium
took
place
at

and
18
October
in
Belgium
.


The
Israeli–Palestinian
conflict
(
;
)
is
the
ongoing
struggle
between
Israelis
and
Palestinians
that
began
in
the
mid-20th
century
.


The
origins
to
the
conflict
can
be
traced
back
to
Jewish
immigration
and
sectarian
conflict
in
Mandatory
Palestine
between
Jews
and
Arabs
.


It
has
been
referred
to
as
the
world
's
``
most
intractable
conflict
''
,
with
the
ongoing
Israeli
occupation
of
the
West
Bank
and
the
Gaza
Strip
reaching
52
years
.


Despite
a
long-term
peace
process
and
the
general
reconciliation
of
Israel
with
Egypt
and
Jordan
,
Israelis
and
Palestinians
have
failed
to
reach
a
final
peace
agreement
.


The
key
issues
are
:
mutual
recognition
,
borders
,
security
,
water
rights
,
control
of
Jerusalem
,
Israeli
settlements
,
Palestinian
freedom
of
movement
,
and
Palestinian
right
of
return
.


The
violence
of
the
conflict
,
in
a
region
rich
in
sites
of
historic
,
cultural
and
religious
interest
worldwide
,
has
been
the
object
of
numerous
international
conferences
dealing
with
historic
rights
,
security
issues
and
human
rights
,
and
has
been
a
factor
hampering
tourism
in
and
general
access
to
areas
that
are
hotly
contested
.


Many
attempts
have
been
made
to
broker
a
two-state
solution
,
involving
the
creation
of
an
independent
Palestinian
state
alongside
the
State
of
Israel
(
after
Israel
's
establishment
in
1948
)
.


In
2007
,
the
majority
of
both
Israelis
and
Palestinians
,
according
to
a
number
of
polls
,
preferred
the
two-state
solution
over
any
other
solution
as
a
means
of
resolving
the
conflict
.


Moreover
,
a
majority
of
Jews
see
the
Palestinians
'
demand
for
an
independent
state
as
just
,
and
thinks
Israel
can
agree
to
the
establishment
of
such
a
state
.


the
majority
of
palestinians
and
israelis
in
the
west
bank
and
gaza
strip
have
expressed
a
preference
for
a
two-state
solution
.


Mutual
distrust
and
significant
disagreements
are
deep
over
basic
issues
,
as
is
the
reciprocal
scepticism
about
the
other
side
's
commitment
to
upholding
obligations
in
an
eventual
agreement
.


Within
Israeli
and
Palestinian
society
,
the
conflict
generates
a
wide
variety
of
views
and
opinions
.


This
highlights
the
deep
divisions
which
exist
not
only
between
Israelis
and
Palestinians
,
but
also
within
each
society
.


A
hallmark
of
the
conflict
has
been
the
level
of
violence
witnessed
for
virtually
its
entire
duration
.


Fighting
has
been
conducted
by
regular
armies
,
paramilitary
groups
,
terror
cells
,
and
individuals
.


Casualties
have
not
been
restricted
to
the
military
,
with
a
large
number
of
fatalities
in
civilian
population
on
both
sides
.


There
are
prominent
international
actors
involved
in
the
conflict
.


The
two
parties
engaged
in
direct
negotiation
are
the
Israeli
government
,
currently
led
by
Benjamin
Netanyahu
,
and
the
Palestine
Liberation
Organization
(
PLO
)
,
currently
headed
by
Mahmoud
Abbas
.


The
official
negotiations
are
mediated
by
an
international
contingent
known
as
the
Quartet
on
the
Middle
East
(
the
``
Quartet
''
)
represented
by
a
special
envoy
,
that
consists
of
the
United
States
,
Russia
,
the
European
Union
,
and
the
United
Nations
.


The
Arab
League
is
another
important
actor
,
which
has
proposed
an
alternative
peace
plan
.


Egypt
,
a
founding
member
of
the
Arab
League
,
has
historically
been
a
key
participant
.


Jordan
,
having
relinquished
its
claim
to
the
West
Bank
in
1988
and
holding
a
special
role
in
the
Muslim
Holy
shrines
in
Jerusalem
,
has
also
been
a
key
participant
.


since
2006
,
the
palestinian
side
has
been
fractured
by
conflict
between
the
two
major
factions
:
fatah
,
the
traditionally
dominant
party
,
and
its
later
electoral
challenger
,
hamas
.


After
Hamas
's
electoral
victory
in
2006
,
the
Quartet
conditioned
future
foreign
assistance
to
the
Palestinian
National
Authority
(
PA
)
on
the
future
government
's
commitment
to
non-violence
,
recognition
of
the
State
of
Israel
,
and
acceptance
of
previous
agreements
.


Hamas
rejected
these
demands
,
which
resulted
in
the
Quartet
's
suspension
of
its
foreign
assistance
program
,
and
the
imposition
of
economic
sanctions
by
the
Israelis
.


a
year
later
,
following
hamas
's
seizure
of
power
in
the
gaza
strip
in
june
2007
,
the
territory
officially
recognized
as
the
pa
was
split
between
fatah
in
the
west
bank
,
and
hamas
in
the
gaza
strip
.


The
division
of
governance
between
the
parties
had
effectively
resulted
in
the
collapse
of
bipartisan
governance
of
the
PA
.


However
,
in
2014
,
a
Palestinian
Unity
Government
,
composed
of
both
Fatah
and
Hamas
,
was
formed
.


The
latest
round
of
peace
negotiations
began
in
July
2013
and
was
suspended
in
2014
.


Unternehmen
Donnerkeil
(
Operation
Thunderbolt
)
was
the
codename
for
a
German
military
operation
of
the
Second
World
War
.


``
Donnerkeil
''
was
designed
as
an
air
superiority
operation
to
support
the
``
Kriegsmarine
''
(
German
Navy
)
Operation
Cerberus
,
also
known
as
the
Channel
Dash
.


In
1941
``
Kriegsmarine
''
surface
vessels
had
carried
out
commerce
raiding
sorties
in
support
of
the
German
U-Boats
in
the
Battle
of
the
Atlantic
.


In
January
1941
Operation
Berlin
was
launched
followed
by
Operation
Rheinübung
in
May
1941
.


The
dominance
of
the
Royal
Navy
's
surface
fleet
prevented
the
German
units
returning
to
ports
in
the
Baltic
sea
or
Germany
.

surviving

The
Reichstag
fire
(
,
)
was
an
arson
attack
on
the
Reichstag
building
,
home
of
the
German
parliament
in
Berlin
,
on
Monday
27
February
1933
,
precisely
four
weeks
after
Adolf
Hitler
was
sworn
in
as
Chancellor
of
Germany
.


Hitler
's
government
stated
that
Marinus
van
der
Lubbe
,
a
Dutch
council
communist
,
was
culprit
,
and
they
attributed
the
fire
to
communist
agitators
in
general—though
a
German
court
decided
later
that
year
that
Van
der
Lubbe
had
acted
alone
,
as
he
claimed
.


After
the
fire
,
the
Reichstag
Fire
Decree
was
passed
.


the
nazi
party
used
the
fire
as
a
pretext
that
communists
were
plotting
against
the
german
government
,
and
the
event
is
considered
pivotal
in
the
establishment
of
nazi
germany
.


The
term
``
Reichstag
fire
''
has
come
to
refer
to
false
flag
actions
facilitated
by
an
authority
to
promote
their
own
interests
through
popular
approval
of
retribution
or
retraction
of
civil
rights
.


The
first
report
of
the
fire
came
shortly
after
21:00
,
when
a
Berlin
fire
station
received
an
alarm
call
.


By
the
time
that
police
and
firefighters
arrived
,
the
main
Chamber
of
Deputies
was
engulfed
in
flames
.


The
police
conducted
a
thorough
search
inside
the
building
and
accused
Van
der
Lubbe
.


He
was
arrested
,
as
were
four
communist
leaders
soon
after
.


hitler
urged
president
paul
von
hindenburg
to
pass
an
emergency
decree
to
suspend
civil
liberties
and
pursue
a
``
ruthless
confrontation
''
with
the
communist
party
of
germany
.


after
passing
the
decree
,
the
government
instituted
mass
arrests
of
communists
,
including
all
of
the
communist
party
parliamentary
delegates
.


with
their
bitter
rival
communists
gone
and
their
seats
empty
,
the
nazi
party
went
from
being
a
plurality
party
to
the
majority
,
thus
enabling
hitler
to
consolidate
his
power
.


In
February
1933
,
Bulgarians
Georgi
Dimitrov
,
Vasil
Tanev
,
and
Blagoy
Popov
were
arrested
,
and
they
played
pivotal
roles
during
the
Leipzig
Trial
,
known
also
as
the
``
Reichstag
Fire
Trial
''
.


They
were
known
to
the
Prussian
police
as
senior
Comintern
operatives
,
but
the
police
had
no
idea
how
senior
they
were
;
Dimitrov
was
head
of
all
Comintern
operations
in
Western
Europe
.


The
responsibility
for
the
Reichstag
fire
remains
a
topic
of
debate
and
research
.


Historians
disagree
as
to
whether
Van
der
Lubbe
acted
alone
,
as
he
said
,
to
protest
the
condition
of
the
German
working
class
.


The
Nazis
accused
the
Comintern
of
the
act
.


some
historians
endorse
the
theory
proposed
by
the
communist
party
that
the
arson
was
planned
and
ordered
by
the
nazis
as
a
false
flag
operation
.


The
building
remained
in
its
fire-damaged
state
until
it
was
partially
repaired
from
1961
to
1964
,
then
completely
restored
from
1995
to
1999
.


In
2008
,
Germany
posthumously
pardoned
Van
der
Lubbe
under
a
law
introduced
in
1998
to
lift
unjust
verdicts
dating
from
the
Nazi
era
.

to
1975
.


It
attracted
up
to
45,000
patrons
and
was
promoted
by
Odessa
Promotions
,
which
was
formed
by
a
group
of
television
professionals
,
including
John
Fowler
,
from
GTV

Melbourne
.


although
conceived
and
promoted
as
australia
's
woodstock
,
the
sunbury
pop
festivals
signalled
the
end
of
the
hippie
peace
movement
of
the
late
1960s
and
the
beginning
of
the
reign
of
pub
rock

The
early

they

despite
crowd
screams

In
1975

A
fracas
developed
on-stage
between
Deep

's
roadies
and
AC/DC
's
roadies
and
members
.


Due
to
poor
weather
and
high
ticket
prices
the
attendance
was
down
to
16,000
.


Odessa
Promotions
was
liquidated
after
paying
out
Deep

but
most
local
acts
were
not
paid
by
Odessa
.


Late
in
the
year
,
Deep

placed
money
into
a

that
unpaid

The
sieges
of
Taunton
were
a
series
of
three
blockades
during
the
First
English
Civil
War
.


The
town
of
Taunton
,
in
Somerset
,
was
considered
to
be
of
strategic
importance
because
it
controlled
the
main
road
from
Bristol
to
Devon
and
Cornwall
.


Robert
Blake
commanded
the
town
's
Parliamentarian
defences
during
all
three
sieges
,
from
September
1644
to
July
1645
.


The
first
siege
was
laid
by
Edmund
Wyndham
on
23
September
,
and
was
primarily
composed
of
Royalist
troops
from
local
Somerset
garrisons
.


After
initial
assaults
drove
Blake
and
his
troops
back
into
Taunton
Castle
,
the
blockade
was
conducted
from
away
,
and
concentrated
more
on
starving
the
garrison
than
continued
attacks
.


The
town
was
relieved
by
a
force
under
James
Holborne
on
14
December
.


over
the
next
three
months
,
blake
was
able
to
establish
a
network
of
earthen
defences
in
taunton
,
including
a
basic
perimeter
and
several
forts
.


The
Royalists
began
the
second
,
and
bloodiest
,
siege
in
late
March
1645
,
initially
under
Sir
Richard
Grenville
.


A
series
of
disputes
between
the
Royalist
commanders
allowed
Taunton
some
respite
at
the
start
of
the
siege
,
but
in
May
the
attacks
were
fierce
under
the
command
of
Sir
Ralph
Hopton
.


After
five
days
of
intense
fighting
,
which
had
once
again
driven
the
defending
army
back
to
a
small
central
perimeter
including
the
castle
,
the
Royalists
retreated
in
the
face
of
a
Parliamentarian
relief
army
commanded
by
Ralph
Weldon
.


Lord
Goring
,
who
had
proposed
the
second
siege
,
renewed
the
blockade
for
a
third
time
in
mid-May
,
after
engaging
Weldon
's
departing
army
and
forcing
it
back
into
Taunton
.


Goring
's
siege
was
lax
and
allowed
provisions
into
the
town
,
diminishing
its
effectiveness
.


The
Parliamentarian
defence
tied
up
Goring
and
his
10–15,000
troops
,
who
would
have
otherwise
been
available
to
fight
for
King
Charles
at
Naseby
,
where
historians
believe
they
could
have
tipped
the
battle
in
favour
of
the
Royalists
.


Instead
,
after
securing
a
Parliamentarian
victory
at
Naseby
,
Thomas
Fairfax
marched
his
army
to
relieve
Taunton
on
9
July
1645
.


the
17
july
revolution
was
a
bloodless
coup
in
iraq
in
1968
,
led
by
general
ahmed
hassan
al-bakr
,
which
brought
the
iraqi
regional
branch
of
the
arab
socialist
ba'ath
party
to
power
.


Both
Saddam
Hussein
,
later
President
of
Iraq
,
and
Salah
Omar
al-Ali
,
later
a
Ba'athist
dissident
,
were
major
participants
in
the
coup
.


the
ba'ath
party
ruled
from
the
17
july
revolution
until
2003
,
when
it
was
removed
from
power
by
an
invasion
led
by
u.s.
and
british
forces
.


(
the
17
july
revolution
is
not
to
be
confused
with
the
14
july
revolution
,
a
coup
on
14
july
1958
,
when
king
faisal
ii
was
overthrown
,
ending
the
hashemite
dynasty
in
iraq
and
establishing
the
republic
of
iraq
.
)


While
the
exact
circumstances
leading
up
to
the
coup
are
shrouded
in
mystery
,
it
appears
that
the
non-Ba'athists
Abd
ar-Razzaq
an-Naif
and
Ibrahim
Al-Daoud—who
were
,
respectively
,
in
charge
of
President
Abdul
Rahman
Arif
's
military
intelligence
and
personal
security—initiated
the
plot
,
and
that
Ba'athist
conspirators
including
al-Bakr
,
Hardan
al-Tikriti
,
and
Salih
Mahdi
Ammash
were
only
asked
to
participate
in
order
to
establish
a
broader
coalition
of
support
for
a
new
government
.


Many
of
the
plotters
were
reportedly
``
fond
of
President
'Arif
''
;
however
,
the
coup
was
motivated
by
rumors
that
Arif
's
Nasserist
(
and
former
Ba'athist
)
Prime
Minister
,
Tahir
Yahya
,
who
was
increasingly
dominating
Arif
's
``
weak
''
government
due
to
the
political
climate
engendered
by
the
costly
Arab
defeat
in
the
Six-Day
War
,
planned
to
formally
usurp
all
power
for
himself
.


After
his
ouster
,
Arif
was
sent
on
a
plane
to
the
United
Kingdom
,
and
even
Yahya
was
not
executed
,
because
``
the
new
group
...
did
n't
want
world
opinion
to
say
theirs
was
just
another
Iraqi
blood
bath
.
''


However
,
on
30
July
al-Bakr
arranged
for
the
exile
of
both
an-Naif
and
Al-Daoud
,
and
assumed
the
position
of
Prime
Minister
from
an-Naif
,
solidifying
the
Ba'ath
's
control
over
Iraq
for
the
next
thirty-five
years—as
al-Bakr
's
deputy
,
Saddam
Hussein
,
``
succeeded
in
consolidating
a
formidable
political
regime
...
where
so
many
others
had
failed
,
''
including
co-opting
Yahya
's
intention
to
nationalize
the
Iraq
Petroleum
Company
(
IPC
)
with
the
help
of
the
Soviet
Union
.

was
the
first
day
of

(
``

,
which
was
the
codename
of
a
military
operation
by
nazi
germany
's
``
luftwaffe
''
(
german
air
force
)
to
destroy
the
british
royal

(

.


By
June
1940
,
the
Allies
had
been
defeated
in
Western
Europe
and
Scandinavia
.


Rather
than
come
to
terms
with
Germany
,
Britain
rejected
all
overtures
for
a
negotiated
peace
.


During
the
Battle
of
Britain
,
Hitler
gave
the
German
armed
forces
(
``
Wehrmacht
''
)
a
directive
(
Directive
No
.


16
)
that
ordered
provisional
preparations
for
invasion
of
Britain
.


This
operation
was
codenamed
Operation
Sea
Lion
(
``
Unternehmen
Seelöwe
''
)
.


Before
this
could
be
carried
out
,
air
superiority
or
air
supremacy
was
required
.


The
``
Luftwaffe
''
was
to
destroy
the
RAF
in
order
to
prevent
it
from
attacking
the
invasion
fleet
or
providing
protection
for
the
Royal
Navy
's
Home
Fleet
which
might
attempt
to
prevent
a
landing
by
sea
.


on
1
august
hitler
gave
the
``
luftwaffe
''
s
commander-in-chief
,
``
reichsmarschall
''
(
empire
marshal
)
hermann
UNK
and
the
``

(
high
command
of
the
air
force
)
a
directive
(
directive
no
.


17
)
to
launch
the
air
assault
.


The
essential
target
was
RAF
Fighter
Command
.


The
service
's
destruction
would
deny
the
British
their
air
superiority
asset
.


Throughout
July
and
early
August
,
the
Germans
made
preparations
for
``
Adlertag
''
.


The
date
of
the
assault
was
postponed
several
times
because
of
bad
weather
.


Eventually
,
it
was
carried
out
on
13
August
1940
.


The
German
attacks
on
13
August
inflicted
significant
damage
and
casualties
on
the
ground
,
but
,
marred
by
poor
intelligence
and
communication
,
they
did
not
make
a
significant
impression
on
Fighter
Command
's
ability
to
defend
British
air
space
.


Göring
had
promised
Hitler
that
``
Adlertag
''
and
``
Adlerangriff
''
would
achieve
the
results
required
within
days
,
or
at
worst
weeks
.


It
had
meant
to
be
the
beginning
of
the
end
of
RAF
Fighter
Command
,
but
``
Adlertag
''
and
the
following
operations
failed
to
destroy
the
RAF
,
or
gain
the
necessary
local
air
superiority
.


As
a
result
,
Operation
Sea
Lion
was
postponed
indefinitely
.


Hurricane
Beta
was
a
compact
and
intense
tropical
cyclone
that
impacted
the
southwestern
Caribbean
in
late
October
2005
.


Beta
was
the
twenty-fourth
tropical
or
subtropical
storm
,
fourteenth
hurricane
,
and
seventh
and
final
major
hurricane
of
the
record-breaking
2005
Atlantic
hurricane
season
.


on
october
21
,
a
developing
tropical
wave
entered
the
eastern
caribbean
sea
and
spawned
tropical
storm
alpha
the
following
day
.


As
the
wave
entered
the
southwestern
Caribbean
,
convection
redeveloped
and
on
October
26
,
the
system
spawned
another
low-pressure
area
which
developed
into
Tropical
Depression
Twenty-six
.


The
depression
intensified
into
a
tropical
storm
the
next
morning
and
was
named
Beta
.


By
the
morning
of
October
28
,
the
storm
intensified
into
a
hurricane
,
the
fourteenth
of
the
season
.


Beta
underwent
rapid
intensification
for
several
hours
to
attain
its
peak
intensity
with
winds
of
115
mph
(
185
km/h
)
on
October
30
.


The
storm
began
to
deteriorate
before
landfall
,
weakening
to
Category
2
status
as
it
crossed
the
Nicaraguan
coastline
.


Rapid
weakening
followed
landfall
,
and
the
storm
dissipated
early
the
next
morning
.


Due
to
the
storm
's
proximity
to
Central
America
,
several
countries
were
placed
on
alert
and
began
allocating
supplies
for
a
potential
disaster
.


Several
hurricane
watches
and
warnings
were
raised
for
the
small
Colombian
island
of
Providencia
as
well
as
the
Nicaragua
and
Honduras
coastlines
.


An
estimated
150,000
people
were
evacuated
from
dangerous
regions
in
Nicaragua
and
more
than
125,000
more
were
evacuated
in
Honduras
.


As
a
tropical
storm
,
Beta
produced
heavy
rains
over
northern
Panama
,
amounting
up
to
3
inches
(
76
mm
)
,
which
caused
several
mudslides
as
well
as
three
fatalities
.


On
October
29
,
the
storm
passed
over
Providencia
Island
,
caused
significant
damage
to
structures
,
and
injured
30
people
.


In
Honduras
and
Nicaragua
,
over
1,000
structures
were
damaged
by
the
storm
,
hundreds
of
which
were
destroyed
.


Ten
people
were
initially
feared
dead
after
their
boat
went
adrift
during
the
storm
.


However
,
a
Panamanian
vessel
rescued
the
men
after
drifting
in
the
water
for
several
hours
.


Rains
in
Honduras
totaled
to
21.82
in
(
554
mm
)
and
6.39
in
(
162
mm
)
in
Nicaragua
.


Six
people
were
killed
in
Nicaragua
as
a
result
of
the
storm
and
the
cost
to
repair
damages
exceeded
300
million
córdoba
(
$
14.5
million
USD
)
.


Overall
,
Beta
was
responsible
for
nine
fatalities
and
more
than
$
15.5
million
in
damage
across
four
countries
.


Hurricane
Lili
was
the
second
costliest
,
deadliest
,
and
strongest
hurricane
of
the
2002
Atlantic
hurricane
season
,
being
surpassed
by
Hurricane
Isidore
,
which
affected
the
same
areas
around
a
week
before
Lili
.


Lili
was
the
twelfth
named
storm
,
fourth
hurricane
,
and
second
major
hurricane
of
the
2002
Atlantic
hurricane
season
.


The
storm
developed
from
a
tropical
disturbance
in
the
open
Atlantic
on
September
21
.


It
continued
westward
,
affecting
the
Lesser
Antilles
as
a
tropical
storm
,
then
entered
the
Caribbean
.


As
it
moved
west
,
the
storm
dissipated
while
being
affected
by
wind
shear
south
of
Cuba
,
and
regenerated
when
the
vertical
wind
shear
weakened
.


It
turned
to
the
northwest
and
strengthened
up
to
category
2
strength
on
October
1
.


Lili
made
two
landfalls
in
western
Cuba
later
that
day
,
and
then
entered
the
Gulf
of
Mexico
.


The
hurricane
rapidly
strengthened
on
October
2
,
reaching
Category
4
strength
that
afternoon
.


It
weakened
rapidly
thereafter
,
and
hit
Louisiana
as
a
Category
1
hurricane
on
October
3
.


It
moved
inland
and
dissipated
on
October
6
.


Lili
caused
extensive
damage
through
the
Caribbean
,
particularly
to
crops
and
poorly
built
homes
.


Mudslides
were
common
on
the
more
mountainous
islands
,
particularly
Haiti
and
Jamaica
.


In
the
United
States
,
the
storm
cut
off
the
production
of
oil
within
the
Gulf
of
Mexico
,
and
caused
severe
damage
in
parts
of
Louisiana
.


Lili
was
also
responsible
for
severe
damage
to
the
barrier
islands
and
marshes
in
the
southern
portion
of
the
state
.


Total
damage
amounted
to
$
925
million
(
2002
USD
)
,
and
the
storm
killed
15
people
during
its
existence
.


``
Bring
Us
Together
''
was
a
political
slogan
popularized
after
the
election
of
Republican
candidate
Richard
Nixon
as
United
States
President
in
1968
.


The
text
was
derived
from
a
sign
which
13-year-old
Vicki
Lynne
Cole
stated
that
she
carried
at
Nixon
's
rally
in
her
home
town
of
Deshler
,
Ohio
during
the
campaign
.


Richard
Moore
,
a
friend
of
Nixon
,
told
the
candidate
's
speechwriters
he
had
seen
a
child
carrying
a
sign
reading
``
Bring
Us
Together
''
at
the
Deshler
rally
.


The
speechwriters
,
including
William
Safire
,
began
inserting
the
phrase
into
the
candidate
's
speeches
.


Nixon
mentioned
the
Deshler
rally
and
the
sign
in
his
victory
speech
on
November
6
,
1968
,
adopting
the
phrase
as
representing
his
administration
's
initial
goal—to
reunify
the
bitterly
divided
country
.


Cole
came
forward
as
the
person
who
carried
the
sign
,
and
was
the
subject
of
intense
media
attention
.


Nixon
invited
Cole
and
her
family
to
the
inauguration
,
and
she
appeared
on
a
float
in
the
inaugural
parade
.


The
phrase
``
Bring
Us
Together
''
was
used
ironically
by
Democrats
when
Nixon
proposed
policies
they
disagreed
with
or
refused
to
support
.


Cole
declined
to
comment
on
Nixon
's
1974
resignation
,
but
subsequently
expressed
her
sympathy
for
him
.


In
newspaper
columns
written
in
his
final
years
before
his
2009
death
,
Safire
expressed
doubts
that
Cole
's
sign
ever
existed
.


The
Battle
of
Salamis
(
;
,
``
Naumachia
tēs
Salaminos
''
)
was
a
naval
battle
fought
between
an
alliance
of
Greek
city-states
under
Themistocles
and
the
Persian
Empire
under
King
Xerxes
in
480
BC
which
resulted
in
a
decisive
victory
for
the
outnumbered
Greeks
.


The
battle
was
fought
in
the
straits
between
the
mainland
and
Salamis
,
an
island
in
the
Saronic
Gulf
near
Athens
,
and
marked
the
high-point
of
the
second
Persian
invasion
of
Greece
.


To
block
the
Persian
advance
,
a
small
force
of
Greeks
blocked
the
pass
of
Thermopylae
,
while
an
Athenian-dominated
Allied
navy
engaged
the
Persian
fleet
in
the
nearby
straits
of
Artemisium
.


In
the
resulting
Battle
of
Thermopylae
,
the
rearguard
of
the
Greek
force
was
annihilated
,
whilst
in
the
Battle
of
Artemisium
the
Greeks
had
heavy
losses
and
retreated
after
the
loss
at
Thermopylae
.


This
allowed
the
Persians
to
conquer
Phocis
,
Boeotia
,
Attica
,
and
Euboea
.


The
Allies
prepared
to
defend
the
Isthmus
of
Corinth
while
the
fleet
was
withdrawn
to
nearby
Salamis
Island
.


although
heavily
outnumbered
,
the
greek
allies
were
persuaded
by
the
athenian
general
themistocles
to
bring
the
persian
fleet
to
battle
again
,
in
the
hope
that
a
victory
would
prevent
naval
operations
against
the
peloponnese
.


The
Persian
king
Xerxes
was
also
eager
for
a
decisive
battle
.


As
a
result
of
subterfuge
on
the
part
of
Themistocles
,
the
Persian
navy
rowed
into
the
Straits
of
Salamis
and
tried
to
block
both
entrances
.


In
the
cramped
conditions
of
the
Straits
,
the
great
Persian
numbers
were
an
active
hindrance
,
as
ships
struggled
to
maneuver
and
became
disorganized
.


Seizing
the
opportunity
,
the
Greek
fleet
formed
in
line
and
scored
a
decisive
victory
.


Xerxes
retreated
to
Asia
with
much
of
his
army
,
leaving
Mardonius
to
complete
the
conquest
of
Greece
.


However
,
the
following
year
,
the
remainder
of
the
Persian
army
was
decisively
beaten
at
the
Battle
of
Plataea
and
the
Persian
navy
at
the
Battle
of
Mycale
.


The
Persians
made
no
further
attempts
to
conquer
the
Greek
mainland
.


These
battles
of
Salamis
and
Plataea
thus
mark
a
turning
point
in
the
course
of
the
Greco-Persian
wars
as
a
whole
;
from
then
onward
,
the
Greek
``
poleis
''
would
take
the
offensive
.

Canada
's
Hundred
Days
is
the
name
given
to
the
series
of
attacks
made
by
the
Canadian
Corps
between
8
August
and
11
November
1918
,
during
the
Hundred
Days
Offensive
of
World
War
I
.


Reference
to
this
period
as
Canada
's
Hundred
Days
is
due
to
the
substantial
role
that
Canadian
Corps
played
during
the
offensive
.


During
this
time
,
forming
part
of
the
British
First
Army
,
the
Canadian
Corps
fought
in
the
Battle
of
Amiens
,
Second
Battle
of
the
Somme
,
Battle
of
the
Scarpe
,
Battle
of
the
Canal
du
Nord
,
Battle
of
Cambrai
,
Battle
of
the
Selle
,
Battle
of
Valenciennes
and
finally
at
Mons
,
on
the
final
day
of
combat
before
the
Armistice
of
11
November
1918
.


In
terms
of
numbers
,
during
those
96
days
the
Canadian
Corps
'
four
over-strength
or
``
heavy
''
divisions
totalling
roughly
100,000
men
,
engaged
and
defeated
or
put
to
flight
elements
of
47
German
divisions
,
which
represented
one
quarter
of
the
German
forces
faced
by
the
Allied
Powers
fighting
on
the
Western
Front
.


However
,
their
successes
came
at
a
heavy
cost
;
Canadians
suffered
20
%
of
their
battle-sustained
casualties
of
the
war
during
the
same
period
.


The
Canadian
Corps
suffered
45,835
casualties
during
this
offensive
.


The
Battle
of
Krasos
was
a
battle
in
the
Arab–Byzantine
Wars
that
took
place
in
August
804
,
between
the
Byzantines
under
Emperor
Nikephoros
I
(
r.
802–811
)
and
an
Abbasid
army
under
Ibrahim
ibn
Jibril
.


Nikephoros
'
accession
in
802
resulted
in
a
resumption
of
warfare
between
Byzantium
and
the
Abbasid
Caliphate
.


In
late
summer
804
,
the
Abbasids
had
invaded
Byzantine
Asia
Minor
for
one
of
their
customary
raids
,
and
Nikephoros
set
out
to
meet
them
.


He
was
surprised
,
however
,
at
Krasos
and
heavily
defeated
,
barely
escaping
with
his
own
life
.


A
truce
and
prisoner
exchange
were
afterwards
arranged
.


Despite
his
defeat
,
and
a
massive
Abbasid
invasion
the
next
year
,
Nikephoros
persevered
until
troubles
in
the
eastern
provinces
of
the
Caliphate
forced
the
Abbasids
to
conclude
a
peace
.


The
Italian
Wars
,
often
referred
to
as
the
Great
Wars
of
Italy
and
sometimes
as
the
Habsburg–Valois
Wars
,
were
a
long
series
of
wars
fought
between
1494
and
1559
in
Italy
during
the
Renaissance
.


The
Italian
peninsula
,
economically
advanced
but
politically
divided
between
several
states
,
became
the
main
battleground
for
European
supremacy
.


The
conflicts
involved
the
major
powers
of
Italy
and
Europe
,
in
a
series
of
events
that
followed
the
end
of
the
40-years
long
Peace
of
Lodi
agreed
in
1454
with
the
formation
of
an
Italic
League
.


The
collapse
of
the
alliance
in
the
1490s
left
Italy
open
to
the
ambitions
of
Charles
VIII
of
France
,
who
invaded
the
Kingdom
of
Naples
in
1494
on
the
ground
of
a
dynastic
claim
.


The
French
were
however
forced
to
leave
Naples
after
the
Republic
of
Venice
formed
an
alliance
with
Austria
and
Spain
.


In
1499
,
Louis
XII
of
France
initiated
a
second
campaign
against
Naples
by
first
taking
control
of
the
Duchy
of
Milan
thanks
to
Cesare
Borgia
,
son
of
Pope
Alexander
VI
and
``
condottiero
''
for
Louis
XII
,
marking
an
open
alliance
between
the
Papacy
and
France
.


The
second
war
ended
in
1503
,
when
the
King
of
Spain
Ferdinand
of
Aragon
(
already
ruler
of
Sicily
and
Sardinia
)
captured
the
Kingdom
of
Naples
from
Louis
XII
.


The
new
Pope
,
Julius
II
(
1503-1513
)
,
reversed
the
policies
of
the
Borgias
and
exiled
Cesare
.


With
France
taking
over
almost
all
of
Northern
Italy
after
defeating
Venice
at
the
Battle
of
Agnadello
and
Ferdinand
of
Aragon
coming
to
southern
Italy
to
be
crowned
King
of
the
Two
Sicilies
,
Julius
II
planned
to
``
free
Italy
from
the
barbarians
''
and
orchestrated
the
recapture
of
the
peninsula
.


After
Spain
recognized
the
Two
Sicilies
as
a
papal
fief
,
Julius
II
personally
led
his
armed
forces
at
the
Battle
of
Mirandola
and
subsequently
forced
the
French
of
Louis
XII
out
of
Italy
in
alliance
with
Switzerland
and
the
Holy
Roman
Empire
.


The
sudden
death
of
Julius
II
led
to
the
restoration
of
the
status
quo
ante
bellum
in
1516
:
the
treaties
of
Brussels
and
Noyon
,
arranged
by
Maximilian
I
,
Holy
Roman
Emperor
and
Pope
Leo
X
,
recognized
French
control
in
the
north
(
excluding
the
Venetian
republic
)
and
Spanish
control
in
the
south
.


War
resumed
in
1521
as
Pope
Leo
X
and
Charles
V
,
Holy
Roman
Emperor
(
simultaneously
ruler
of
Austria
,
the
Spanish
kingdoms
,
and
the
Low
Countries
)
expelled
French
forces
from
Milan
.


Francis
I
of
France
reacted
by
descending
in
Italy
and
fighting
Imperial
forces
at
the
Battle
of
Pavia
(
1525
)
,
where
he
was
captured
and
forced
to
give
French
territory
to
the
Habsburg
Netherlands
of
Charles
V.
Following
his
liberation
,
Francis
I
initiated
a
new
war
in
Italy
during
which
mutinous
Germanic
troops
of
lutheran
faith
sacked
Rome
(
1527
)
and
expelled
the
Medici
from
Florence
.


After
ordering
the
retreat
of
Imperial
troops
from
the
Papal
States
,
Charles
V
restored
the
occupied
French
territory
to
Francis
I
on
the
condition
that
France
abandoned
northern
Italy
(
``
Peace
of
the
Ladies
''
)
.


at
the
congress
of
bologna
in
1530
,
charles
v
received
the
imperial
title
of
king
of
italy
by
pope
clement
vii
.


In
exchange
,
the
Pope
obtained
the
restoration
of
the
Medici
family
as
the
ruling
dynasty
of
Florence
.


Following
Catholic
victories
in
Vienna
and
Tunis
against
the
Ottomans
,
a
new
congress
(
1536
)
was
held
in
Rome
between
Charles
V
and
Pope
Paul
III
to
discuss
the
hypothesis
of
an
ecumenical
council
to
deal
with
Protestantism
.


Despite
fears
of
conciliarism
within
the
curia
,
Pope
Paul
III
ultimately
saw
a
council
as
an
opportunity
to
end
the
Catholic
Imperial-French
wars
in
Italy
by
uniting
the
anti-calvinist
French
royalty
with
the
Habsburgs
against
a
common
enemy
.


Indeed
,
the
conflict
had
resumed
at
the
Lombard-Piedmontese
border
with
the
French
occupation
of
the
Savoyard
state
soon
after
Charles
V
took
the
vacant
Duchy
of
Milan
.


Therefore
,
Pope
Paul
III
favored
the
``
Truce
of
Nice
''
between
Francis
I
and
the
Emperor
(
1538
)
as
well
as
the
subsequent
``
Peace
of
Crespy
''
(
1544
)
.


The
Council
of
Trent
began
in
1545
,
but
Lutheran
princes
refused
to
recognize
it
with
the
result
of
entering
a
war
with
the
Emperor
(
quickly
lost
)
and
allowing
the
Pope
to
dominate
the
council
and
initiate
the
counter-reformation
.


Around
1547
,
papal
and
imperial
factions
clashed
for
political
supremacy
and
a
series
of
conspiracies
took
place
in
several
courts
of
Italy
.


The
assassination
of
Pier
Luigi
Farnese
,
Duke
of
Parma
and
son
of
the
Pope
,
led
to
the
suspension
of
the
council
until
Pope
Julius
III
reconvened
it
with
the
intention
to
promote
a
reconciliation
of
the
defeated
Lutherans
with
Charles
V.
In
1551
,
Henri
II
of
France
invaded
Tuscany
and
supported
Siena
in
a
war
against
Florence
.


In
addition
,
France
captured
the
Three
Bishoprics
of
the
Holy
Roman
Empire
with
the
support
of
Lutherans
and
formed
an
alliance
with
the
Ottoman
Empire
(
who
had
defeated
Charles
V
in
Algiers
and
Budapest
in
the
1540s
)
in
order
to
invade
Corsica
.


Charles
V
responded
by
forming
an
alliance
with
the
Kingdom
of
England
and
by
suspending
the
reconciliation
with
the
German
lutherans
.


Florence
annexed
Siena
after
victory
over
the
French
at
the
Battle
of
Scannagallo
and
the
Genoese
admiral
Andrea
Doria
recaptured
Corsica
,
but
England
lost
the
Pas-de-Calais
to
France
.


Charles
V
,
facing
the
prospect
of
a
long-lasting
alliance
between
all
of
his
enemies
,
signed
the
Peace
of
Augsburg
with
the
Protestant
princes
and
abdicated
by
dividing
the
Habsburg
Empire
between
the
Austrian
Habsburgs
of
his
brother
Ferdinand
of
Austria
and
the
Spanish
Habsburgs
of
his
son
Philip
II
of
Spain
.


War
continued
between
the
Habsburgs
and
France
,
with
the
latter
being
defeated
by
a
Spanish-Imperial
army
led
by
Emmanuel
Philibert
of
Savoy
(
who
regained
its
estates
)
at
the
Battle
of
St.
Quentin
(
1557
)
.


Nevertheless
,
the
French
recovered
and
the
conflict
was
prolonged
until
a
compromise
was
reached
at
the
Peace
of
Cateau-Cambrésis
in
1559
.


The
end
of
the
wars
allowed
Pope
Pius
IV
and
Carlo
Borromeo
to
resume
the
Council
of
Trent
and
complete
it
in
1563
,
initiating
the
Catholic
Reformation
and
Baroque
period
of
Italy
.


The
Guatemalan
Revolution
(
)
was
the
period
in
Guatemalan
history
between
the
popular
uprising
that
overthrew
dictator
Jorge
Ubico
in
1944
and
the
United
States-orchestrated
coup
d'état
in
1954
that
overthrew
the
democratically
elected
President
Jacobo
Árbenz
.


This
period
has
also
been
called
the
Ten
Years
of
Spring
,
highlighting
the
only
years
of
representative
democracy
in
Guatemala
from
1930
until
the
end
of
the
civil
war
in
1996
,
which
saw
the
implementation
of
a
program
of
social
,
political
,
and
especially
agrarian
reform
that
was
enormously
influential
across
Latin
America
.


From
the
late
19th
century
until
1944
Guatemala
was
governed
by
a
series
of
authoritarian
rulers
who
sought
to
strengthen
the
economy
by
supporting
the
export
of
coffee
.


Between
1898
and
1920
,
Manuel
Estrada
Cabrera
granted
significant
concessions
to
the
United
Fruit
Company
,
an
American
corporation
that
traded
in
tropical
fruit
,
and
dispossessed
many
indigenous
people
of
their
communal
lands
.


Under
Jorge
Ubico
,
who
ruled
as
a
dictator
between
1931
and
1944
,
this
process
was
intensified
,
with
the
institution
of
harsh
labor
regulations
and
a
police
state
.


In
June
1944
,
a
popular
pro-democracy
movement
led
by
university
students
and
labor
organizations
forced
Ubico
to
resign
.


He
appointed
a
three-person
military
junta
to
take
his
place
,
led
by
Federico
Ponce
Vaides
.


this
junta
continued
ubico
's
oppressive
policies
,
until
it
was
toppled
in
a
military
coup
led
by
jacobo
unk
in
october
1944
,
an
event
also
known
as
the
``
october
revolution
''
.


The
coup
leaders
formed
a
junta
which
swiftly
called
for
open
elections
.


These
elections
were
won
in
a
landslide
by
Juan
José
Arévalo
,
a
progressive
professor
of
philosophy
who
had
become
the
face
of
the
popular
movement
.


He
implemented
a
moderate
program
of
social
reform
,
including
a
widely
successful
literacy
campaign
and
a
largely
free
election
process
,
although
illiterate
women
were
not
given
the
vote
and
communist
parties
were
banned
.


Following
the
end
of
Arévalo
's
presidency
in
1951
,
Jacobo
Árbenz
was
elected
to
the
presidency
in
a
landslide
.


The
progressive
military
leader
of
1944
continued
Arévalo
's
reforms
,
and
began
an
ambitious
land-reform
program
,
known
as
Decree
900
.


Under
it
,
the
uncultivated
portions
of
large
land-holdings
were
expropriated
in
return
for
compensation
,
and
redistributed
to
poverty-stricken
agricultural
laborers
.


Approximately
500,000
people
benefited
from
the
decree
.


The
majority
of
them
were
indigenous
people
,
whose
forebears
had
been
dispossessed
after
the
Spanish
invasion
.


Árbenz
's
policies
ran
afoul
of
the
United
Fruit
Company
,
which
lost
some
of
its
uncultivated
land
.


The
company
lobbied
the
US
government
for
the
overthrow
of
Árbenz
,
and
the
State
Department
responded
by
engineering
a
coup
under
the
pretext
that
Árbenz
was
a
communist
.


Carlos
Castillo
Armas
took
power
at
the
head
of
a
military
junta
,
provoking
the
Guatemalan
Civil
War
.


The
war
lasted
from
1960
to
1996
,
and
saw
the
US-backed
military
commit
genocide
against
the
indigenous
Maya
peoples
,
and
widespread
human
rights
violations
against
civilians
.


Velo-city
is
a
series
of
cycle
planning
conferences
that
started
in
1980
in
Bremen
.


The
Velo-city
1980
also
inspired
the
founding
of
the
European
Cyclists
'
Federation
(
ECF
)
in
1983
.


The
conferences
are
one
of
the
world
's
primary
forums
for
the
exchange
of
bicycling
expertise
.


The
name
Velo-city
is
a
small
play
on
word
using
the
French
for
bicycle
–
vélo
,
and
Velo-city
can
also
be
read
as
velocity
or
speed
.


European
Cyclists
’
Federation
owns
the
series
name
,
and
the
ECF
Board
is
the
decision-making
body
for
Velo-city
.


at
the
beginning
,
the
conference
guests
and
speakers
were
mainly
bicycle
advocates
,
but
today
velo-city
is
well
known
for
gathering
all
those
who
are
involved
in
the
policy
,
promotion
and
provision
for
cyclists
.


This
mixture
of
people
,
professions
,
skills
and
experience
is
a
valuable
component
of
the
events
'
success
.


Velo-city
is
a
forum
,
the
place
to
be
for
stakeholders
from
local
,
regional
and
national
authorities
,
politicians
,
academics
,
consultants
,
industrials
,
and
bicycle
users
.


Velo-city
is
an
occasion
for
a
city
to
show
continuous
and
lasting
efforts
to
improve
cycling
in
its
city
.


For
instance
Paris
,
inspired
by
the
Velo-city
2003
conference
,
launched
Velib
in
2007
,
thereby
creating
world-wide
attention
.


The
murder
of
Odin
Lloyd
occurred
on
June
17
,
2013
,
in
North
Attleborough
,
Massachusetts
.


His
death
made
international
headlines
when
Aaron
Hernandez
,
at
the
time
a
tight
end
for
the
New
England
Patriots
of
the
National
Football
League
,
was
investigated
as
a
suspect
in
the
case
.


Prior
to
his
death
,
Lloyd
had
been
a
linebacker
for
a
New
England
Football
League
(
NEFL
)
semi-professional
football
team
the
Boston
Bandits
,
since
2007
.


Hernandez
was
arrested
on
June
26
,
2013
,
nine
days
after
Lloyd
's
death
,
and
charged
with
the
murder
.


Ninety
minutes
after
his
arrest
,
Hernandez
was
released
by
the
Patriots
.


Police
also
arrested
two
other
men
in
connection
with
Lloyd
's
death
:
Carlos
Ortiz
on
June
27
,
2013
,
and
Ernest
Wallace
on
June
28
,
2013
.


Prosecutors
say
both
men
were
with
Hernandez
when
they
drove
to
the
location
of
the
murder
.


On
August
22
,
2013
,
Hernandez
was
indicted
by
a
grand
jury
for
the
murder
of
Odin
Lloyd
.


Nearly
eight
months
later
,
Ortiz
and
Wallace
were
also
indicted
for
the
murder
.


On
April
15
,
2015
,
Hernandez
was
found
guilty
of
first-degree
murder
,
as
well
as
five
weapon
charges
,
which
required
a
mandatory
sentence
of
life
in
prison
without
the
possibility
of
parole
.


He
was
tried
for
two
separate
murder
charges
for
the
2012
double
homicide
of
Daniel
de
Abreu
and
Safiro
Furtado
,
but
was
acquitted
of
these
charges
on
April
14
,
2017
.


On
May
12
,
2016
,
Wallace
was
acquitted
of
first-degree
murder
of
Lloyd
,
but
was
convicted
of
being
an
accessory
after
the
fact
of
the
crime
;
he
was
sentenced
to
serve
four
and
a
half
to
seven
years
in
prison
.


On
June
27
,
2016
,
Ortiz
changed
his
'not
guilty
'
plea
and
pleaded
guilty
to
accessory
after
the
fact
.


In
exchange
for
his
plea
,
prosecutors
dropped
the
murder
charge
against
Ortiz
.


He
was
also
sentenced
to
serve
four
and
a
half
to
seven
years
in
prison
.


On
April
19
,
2017
,
at
3:05
am
,
Hernandez
was
found
dead
in
his
prison
cell
by
correctional
officers
after
apparently
hanging
himself
with
a
bedsheet
.


By
killing
himself
before
the
appeal
of
his
case
could
be
completed
,
Hernandez
's
murder
conviction
was
vacated
,
technically
returning
him
to
a
state
of
innocent
until
proven
guilty
.


The
court
's
decision
to
vacate
was
appealed
by
the
prosecutors
and
the
Lloyd
family
's
attorneys
.


in
march
,
2019
the
mass
.


Supreme
Court
overturned
the
entire
doctrine
of
abatement
``
ab
initio
''
,
thus
reinstating
his
original
murder
conviction
.


The
1777
Siege
of
Fort
Ticonderoga
occurred
between
2
and
6
July
1777
at
Fort
Ticonderoga
,
near
the
southern
end
of
Lake
Champlain
in
the
state
of
New
York
.


Lieutenant
General
John
Burgoyne
's
8,000-man
army
occupied
high
ground
above
the
fort
,
and
nearly
surrounded
the
defenses
.


These
movements
precipitated
the
occupying
Continental
Army
,
an
under-strength
force
of
3,000
under
the
command
of
General
Arthur
St.
Clair
,
to
withdraw
from
Ticonderoga
and
the
surrounding
defenses
.


Some
gunfire
was
exchanged
,
and
there
were
some
casualties
,
but
there
was
no
formal
siege
and
no
pitched
battle
.


burgoyne
's
army
occupied
fort
ticonderoga
and
mount
independence
,
the
extensive
fortifications
on
the
vermont
side
of
the
lake
,
without
opposition
on
6
july
.


Advance
units
pursued
the
retreating
Americans
.


The
uncontested
surrender
of
Ticonderoga
caused
an
uproar
in
the
American
public
and
in
its
military
circles
,
as
Ticonderoga
was
widely
believed
to
be
virtually
impregnable
,
and
a
vital
point
of
defense
.


General
St.
Clair
and
his
superior
,
General
Philip
Schuyler
,
were
vilified
by
Congress
.


Both
were
eventually
exonerated
in
courts
martial
,
but
their
careers
were
adversely
affected
.


Schuyler
had
already
lost
his
command
to
Horatio
Gates
by
the
time
of
the
court
martial
,
and
St.
Clair
held
no
more
field
commands
for
the
remainder
of
the
war
.


The
First
Battle
of
Acentejo
took
place
on
the
island
of
Tenerife
between
the
Guanches
and
an
alliance
of
Spaniards
,
other
Europeans
,
and
associated
natives
(
mostly
from
other
islands
)
,
on
31
May
1494
,
during
the
Spanish
conquest
of
this
island
.


It
resulted
in
a
victory
for
the
Guanches
of
Tenerife
.


The
Spaniards
were
under
the
command
of
the
Adelantado
(
``
military
governor
''
)
Alonso
Fernández
de
Lugo
,
who
had
sold
his
properties
in
order
to
finance
his
conquest
of
Tenerife
.


Fernández
de
Lugo
was
aided
by
the
fact
that
missionaries
had
already
begun
to
Christianize
the
Guanches
of
Tenerife
,
and
several
of
the
Guanches
'
``
menceyatos
''
or
kingdoms
,
which
included
Guimar
,
Abona
,
Adeje
,
and
later
Anaga
,
were
friendly
to
the
Castilians
(
and
known
in
Spanish
as
``
bandos
de
paz
''
)
.


Fernández
de
Lugo
landed
at
Añazo
,
near
present-day
Santa
Cruz
de
Tenerife
,
in
late
April
,
and
built
the
fortified
camp
of
``
el
Real
de
Santa
Cruz
''
.


Advancing
towards
the
interior
of
the
island
,
Fernández
de
Lugo
confirmed
his
friendship
with
the
``
bandos
de
paz
''
and
attempted
to
reach
the
same
arrangement
with
other
Guanche
``
menceyatos
''
,
including
Taoro
.


Bencomo
,
the
ruler
of
Taoro
,
refused
Fernández
de
Lugo
's
terms
,
and
instead
began
to
form
his
own
alliance
against
the
Castilians
,
composed
of
the
``
menceyatos
''
of
Tacoronte
,
Tegueste
,
Daute
,
and
Icod
.


In
a
state
of
war
,
Fernández
de
Lugo
advanced
through
present-day
San
Cristóbal
de
La
Laguna
to
the
area
known
as
Acentejo
.


The
Castilians
committed
the
terrible
blunder
of
walking
blindly
into
the
ravine
now
called
Barranco
de
San
Antonio
(
``
Farfan
''
was
its
Guanche
name
)
,
in
Acentejo
.


Despite
their
technological
superiority
—the
Spaniards
,
protected
with
armour
and
shields
,
fought
with
blunderbusses
and
cannon—
the
Guanches
,
fighting
naked
,
attacked
them
from
the
slopes
with
stones
and
spears
of
hardened
wood
(
known
as
``
banotes
''
)
.


The
Spaniards
were
unable
to
maneuver
with
their
horses
,
because
these
slopes
were
covered
with
very
thick
,
arboreal
brush
,
and
the
Guanches
,
who
numbered
some
3,300
men
under
the
leadership
of
Bencomo
and
his
half-brother
Tinguaro
,
chief
of
the
comarca
of
Acentejo
,
made
use
of
their
mobility
and
intimate
knowledge
of
the
terrain
to
gain
the
upper
hand
.


While
Tinguaro
with
300
men
ambushed
the
vanguard
of
the
Castilian
forces
,
Bencomo
arrived
at
the
battle
with
3,000
men
,
attacking
the
rearguard
of
the
dispersed
Europeans
.


It
is
believed
that
four
out
of
five
Spanish
soldiers
fell
in
this
battle
,
leaving
900–1,000
dead
on
the
battlefield
out
of
the
initial
1,120
.


The
defeat
was
not
total
,
however
.


Fernández
de
Lugo
,
though
wounded
,
was
able
to
escape
with
his
life
(
by
exchanging
the
red
cape
of
an
Adelantado
for
that
of
a
common
soldier
)
,
and
his
surviving
forces
(
some
200
men
)
were
harried
until
he
was
forced
to
re-embark
at
Añazo
and
sail
back
to
Gran
Canaria
.


The
Adelantado
was
able
to
return
and
defeat
the
native
forces
in
two
major
battles
:
the
Battle
of
Aguere
and
Second
Battle
of
Acentejo
,
and
other
minor
clashes
,
such
as
the
Battle
of
Las
Peñuelas
.


A
town
built
on
the
site
where
the
battle
occurred
is
called
La
Matanza
de
Acentejo
(
``
The
Slaughter
of
Acentejo
''
)
,
which
also
contains
a
large
mural
commemorating
the
victory
.


This
was
the
greatest
defeat
in
the
history
of
the
Spanish
Atlantic
expansion
,
in
terms
of
casualties
suffered
by
Spain
.


The
2013
Super
Rugby
final
was
contested
on
3
August
2013
by
the
Canberra-based
Brumbies
and
Hamilton-based
Chiefs
.


The
Chiefs
won
27–22
to
give
them
their
second
consecutive
Super
Rugby
title
.


The
match
was
the
last
of
the
2013
Super
Rugby
season
,
and
was
hosted
by
the
Chiefs
at
Waikato
Stadium
.


It
was
the
eighteenth
final
in
the
history
of
the
Southern
Hemisphere
's
premier
domestic
rugby
competition
,
and
the
third
under
the
expanded
fifteen-team
format
.


The
Chiefs
had
qualified
highest
during
the
regular
season
,
while
the
Brumbies
qualified
third
.


The
Chiefs
directly
qualified
for
their
semi-final
,
where
they
beat
fellow
New
Zealand
team
the
Crusaders
20–19
.


The
Brumbies
defeated
the
Cheetahs
in
a
close
qualifying
final
,
and
then
travelled
to
Pretoria
where
they
beat
the
Bulls
in
their
semi-final
.


The
Chiefs
hosted
the
final
after
qualifying
higher
than
the
Brumbies
,
who
had
to
travel
back
from
South
Africa
for
the
match
.


The
Brumbies
led
early
in
the
final
,
and
were
ahead
16–9
at
half-time
following
a
converted
try
and
three
penalties
from
inside-centre
Christian
Lealiifano
.


After
penalties
were
exchanged
early
in
the
second
half
,
the
Brumbies
were
ahead
22–12
,
before
the
Chiefs
scored
two
tries
and
a
penalty
to
take
the
lead
27–22
with
seven
minutes
remaining
.


The
Brumbies
were
unable
to
score
further
,
and
the
Chiefs
went

tropical
storm
trudy
was
a
short-lived
tropical
cyclone
in
october
2014
that
caused
significant
flooding
in
southern
mexico
.


The
storm
originated
from
an
area
of
low
pressure
associated
with
a
monsoon
trough
near
Central
America
in
early
October
.


A
slow-moving
system
,
the
low
eventually
consolidated
into
a
tropical
depression
on
October
17
near
the
Mexican
coastline
.


Favorable
environmental
conditions
aided
rapid
development
of
Trudy
.


Within
15
hours
of
its
designation
,
an
eye
formed
over
the
storm
's
center
.


Trudy
ultimately
achieved
its
peak
as
a
strong
tropical
storm
with
65
mph
(
100
km/h
)
winds
as
it
made
landfall
just
southeast
of
Marquelia
,
Mexico
.


The
region
's
mountainous
terrain
quickly
weakened
Trudy
and
the
cyclone
dissipated
early
on
October
19
.


though
the
cyclone
dissipated
,
its
remnant
energy
later
contributed
to
the
formation
of
tropical
storm
hanna
in
the
atlantic
.


Prior
to
Trudy
's
landfall
,
the
Government
of
Mexico
issued
multiple
watches
and
warnings
for
the
threatened
region
.


Forecasters
highlighted
the
threat
of
heavy
rains
and
mudslides
.


Guerrero
experienced
the
greatest
effects
from
Trudy
,
with
landslides
and
flooding
claiming
eight
lives
in
the
state
.


over
4,000
people
were
evacuated
in
the
region
.


A
ninth
fatality
took
place
in
Campeche
.


the
easter
rising
(
)
,
also
known
as
the
easter
rebellion
,
was
an
armed
insurrection
in
ireland
during
easter
week
,
april
1916
.


The
Rising
was
launched
by
Irish
republicans
to
end
British
rule
in
Ireland
and
establish
an
independent
Irish
Republic
while
the
United
Kingdom
was
heavily
engaged
in
the
First
World
War
.


It
was
the
most
significant
uprising
in
Ireland
since
the
rebellion
of
1798
,
and
the
first
armed
action
of
the
Irish
revolutionary
period
.


sixteen
of
the
rising
's
leaders
were
executed
in
may
1916
,
but
the
insurrection
,
the
nature
of
the
executions
,
and
subsequent
political
developments
ultimately
contributed
to
an
increase
in
popular
support
for
irish
independence
.


organised
by
a
seven-man
military
council
of
the
irish
republican
brotherhood
,
the
rising
began
on
easter
monday
,
24
april
1916
,
and
lasted
for
six
days
.


Members
of
the
Irish
Volunteers—led
by
schoolmaster
and
Irish
language
activist
Patrick
Pearse
,
joined
by
the
smaller
Irish
Citizen
Army
of
James
Connolly
and
200
women
of
Cumann
na
mBan—seized
key
locations
in
Dublin
and
proclaimed
an
Irish
Republic
.


The
British
Army
brought
in
thousands
of
reinforcements
as
well
as
artillery
and
a
gunboat
.


There
was
fierce
street
fighting
on
the
routes
into
the
city
centre
,
where
the
rebels
put
up
stiff
resistance
,
slowing
the
British
advance
and
inflicting
heavy
casualties
.


Elsewhere
in
Dublin
,
the
fighting
mainly
consisted
of
sniping
and
long-range
gun
battles
.


The
main
rebel
positions
were
gradually
surrounded
and
bombarded
with
artillery
.


There
were
isolated
actions
in
other
parts
of
Ireland
.


volunteer
leader
eoin
macneill
had
issued
a
countermand
in
a
bid
to
halt
the
rising
,
which
greatly
reduced
the
number
of
rebels
who
mobilised
.


with
much
greater
numbers
and
heavier
weapons
,
the
british
army
suppressed
the
rising
.


Pearse
agreed
to
an
unconditional
surrender
on
Saturday
29
April
,
although
sporadic
fighting
continued
briefly
.


After
the
surrender
the
country
remained
under
martial
law
.


About
3,500
people
were
taken
prisoner
by
the
British
,
and
1,800
of
them
were
sent
to
internment
camps
or
prisons
in
Britain
.


most
of
the
leaders
of
the
rising
were
executed
following
courts-martial
.


the
rising
brought
physical
force
republicanism
back
to
the
forefront
of
irish
politics
,
which
for
nearly
50
years
had
been
dominated
by
constitutional
nationalism
.


strong
opposition
to
britain
's
reaction
to
the
rising
contributed
to
changes
in
public
opinion
and
the
move
toward
independence
,
as
shown
in
the
december
1918
election
win
by
the
sinn
UNK
party
.


They
convened
the
First
Dáil
and
declared
the
independence
of
the
Irish
Republic
.


485
people
were
killed
in
the
easter
rising
:
54
%
were
civilians
,
30
%
were
british
military
and
police
,
and
16
%
were
irish
rebels
.


More
than
2,600
were
wounded
.


Many
of
the
civilians
were
killed
as
a
result
of
the
British
using
artillery
and
heavy
machine
guns
,
or
mistaking
civilians
for
rebels
.


Others
were
caught
in
the
crossfire
in
a
crowded
city
.


The
shelling
and
the
fires
it
caused

tropical
storm
flossie
yielded
stormy
weather
to
hawaii
in
late
july
2013
.


The
sixth
tropical
cyclone
and
named
storm
of
the
annual
hurricane
season
,
Flossie
originated
from
a
tropical
wave
that
emerged
off
the
western
coast
of
Africa
on
July
9
.


Tracking
westward
across
the
Atlantic
with
little
development
,
it
passed
over
Central
America
and
into
the
eastern
Pacific
Ocean
on
July
18
,
where
favorable
environmental
conditions
promoted
steady
organization
.


By
0600
UTC
on
July
25
,
the
wave
acquired
enough
organization
to
be
deemed
a
tropical
depression
;
it
intensified
into
a
tropical
storm
six
hours
later
.


Continuing
westward
,
Flossie
attained
peak
winds
of
70
mph
(
110
km/h
)
on
July
27
before
entering
the
central
Pacific
Ocean
.


There
,
unfavorable
upper-level
winds
established
a
weakening
trend
;
on
July
30
,
Flossie
weakened
to
a
tropical
depression
,
and
by
1200
UTC
that
same
day
,
the
storm
degenerated
into
a
remnant
low
,
northeast
of
Kauai
.


In
advance
of
Flossie
,
tropical
cyclone
warnings
and
watches
were
placed
into
effect
for
various
Hawaiian
Islands
.


In
addition
,
numerous
flash
flood
watches
were
issued
in
fear
of
over
a
foot
of
precipitation
.


Ports
and
numerous
facilities
were
closed
to
the
public
,
and
authorities
opened
shelters
for
refuge
.


upon
approach
,
flossie
threatened
to
become
the
first
tropical
storm
to
make
a
direct
hit
on
hawaii
in
two
decades
;
however
,
the
system
weakened
prior
to
doing
so
.


Flossie
brought
high
surf
to
the
state
,
leading
to
minor
beach
erosion
.


Gusty
winds
exceeded
tropical
storm
threshold
,
downing
numerous
power
poles
and
trees
;
as
a
result
,
several
thousand
locals
were
without
power
for
a
few
days
.


the
storm
produced
several
inches
of
rainfall
across
the
island
,
with
a
peak
of
on
mount
waialeale
.


though
one
man
was
injured
due
to
lightnings
,
no
fatalities
were
reported
in
association
with
flossie
.


Damage
totaled
to
$
24,000
(
2013
USD
)
as
a
consequence
of
lightning
.


On
11
April
2001
,
the
Australian
and
American
Samoa
national
association
football
teams
played
each
other
in
a
qualifying
match
for
the
2002
FIFA
World
Cup
.


The
match
was
played
at
the
International
Sports
Stadium
in
Coffs
Harbour
,
Australia
.


Australia
set
a
world
record
for
the
largest
victory
in
an
international
football
match
,
winning
the
game
31–0
.


Australia
's
Archie
Thompson
also
broke
the
record
for
most
goals
scored
by
a
player
in
an
international
match
by
scoring
13
goals
.


David
Zdrilic
,
the
scorer
of
eight
goals
in
the
match
,
achieved
the
second
highest
number
of
goals
in
an
international
match
since
World
War
I
.


The
outcome
of
the
match
led
to
debates
about
the
format
of
qualification
tournaments
,
with
the
Australian
manager
Frank
Farina
and
Thompson
feeling
that
preliminary
rounds
should
be
introduced
to
avoid
such
unbalanced
matches
,
views
shared
by
the
international
footballing
body
FIFA
.


It
eventually
led
to
the
introduction
of
a
preliminary
round
in
the
Oceanian
zone
qualification
for
the
2006
FIFA
World
Cup
.


The
unbalanced
level
of
opponents
was
also
addressed
by
Australia
's
move
to
the
Asian
Football
Confederation
in
2006
.


The
2010–11
Australian
bushfire
season
was
notable
for
a
relative
lack
of
bushfires
along
Eastern
Australia
due
to
a
very
strong
La
Niña
effect
,
which
instead
contributed
to
severe
flooding
,
in
particular
the
2010–2011
Queensland
floods
and
the
2011
Victorian
floods
.


As
a
result
of
these
weather
patterns
,
most
major
fire
events
took
place
in
Western
Australia
and
South
Australia
.


Some
later
significant
fire
activity
occurred
in
Gippsland
in
eastern
Victoria
,
an
area
which
largely
missed
the
rainfall
that
lead
to
the
flooding
in
other
parts
of
the
state
.


On
24
September
2010
,
a
fire
started
west
Walpole
at
the
Boronia
Ridge
sub-division
.


The
fire
moved
east
toward
the
town
and
burned
through
the
thick
coastal
scrub
near
the
Walpole
Inlet
making
access
difficult
for
fire
crews
.


FESA
issued
bushfire
advice
to
residents
of
the
surrounding
areas
.


The
fire
was
contained
by
the
following
day
and
23
hectares
of
bushland
was
burnt
out
with
no
loss
of
homes
.


On
30
November
2010
,
a
fire
began
about
50
km
South
of
Perth
near
the
suburb
of
Karnup
leading
to
FESA
issuing
an
emergency
warning
for
residents
to
take
shelter
and
defend
their
homes
on
1
December
.


By
2
December
the
fire
had
burnt
through
but
had
claimed
no
homes
,
and
was
brought
under
control
by
over
one
hundred
firefighters
.


On
10
January
2011
,
a
fire
began
about
30
km
south
of
Mandurah
,
near
the
suburb
of
Lake
Clifton
,
leading
to
FESA
issuing
an
emergency
warning
for
residents
to
evacuate
or
to
defend
their
homes
on
10
January
.


A
shed
was
burnt
and
flames
were
reported
to
be
as
high
as
a
two-storey
building
.


By
12
January
ten
homes
hade
been
destroyed
and
the
fire
had
burnt
an
area
of
approximately
2000ha
,
the
fire
was
deliberately
lit
with
investigators
identifying
nine
ignition
points
.


The
Comayagua
prison
fire
was
a
deadly
fire
that
occurred
14/15
February
2012
at
the
National
Penitentiary
in
Comayagua
,
Honduras
,
killing
361
people
.


Prisoners
trapped
in
their
cells
died
by
burning
or
suffocation
;
dozens
were
burned
beyond
recognition
.


The
fire
started
late
in
the
evening
of
14
February
.


According
to
one
prisoner
,
calls
for
help
went
out
almost
immediately
and
``
for
a
while
,
nobody
listened
.


But
after
a
few
minutes
,
which
seemed
like
an
eternity
,
a
guard
appeared
with
keys
and
let
us
out
.
''


Rescue
forces
did
not
arrive
until
about
40
minutes
later
.


With
a
death
toll
of
361
,
this
is
the
deadliest
prison
fire
ever
recorded
.


NEVER
was
a
series
of
professional
wrestling
events
held
by
New
Japan
Pro-Wrestling
(
NJPW
)
between
August
2010
and
November
2012
.


On
July
12
,
2010
,
NJPW
officially
announced
the
NEVER
project
,
which
was
to
highlight
younger
up-and-coming
talent
and
outside
wrestlers
not
signed
to
the
promotion
.


It
was
explained
that
the
name
of
the
project
was
an
acronym
of
the
terms
``
New
Blood
''
,
``
Evolution
''
,
``
Valiantly
''
,
``
Eternal
''
and
``
Radical
''
.


For
the
events
,
NJPW
recruited
several
freelancers
as
well
as
wrestlers
signed
to
promotions
such
as
DDT
Pro-Wrestling
and
Kaientai
Dojo
.


Some
outsiders
who
became
NEVER
regulars
included
Daisuke
Sasaki
,
Kaji
Tomato
,
Madoka
,
Ryuichi
Sekine
and
Shinobu
.


Kushida
,
who
entered
NEVER
as
a
representative
of
the
Smash
promotion
in
February
2011
,
signed
a
NJPW
contract
the
following
month
and
returned
to
the
project
the
following
September
,
now
representing
NJPW
.


Three
NJPW
trainees
;
Hiromu
Takahashi
,
Sho
Tanaka
and
Yohei
Komatsu
,
made
their
professional
wrestling
debuts
at
NEVER
events
.


Takahashi
,
who
debuted
at
``
NEVER.1
''
,
was
the
only
wrestler
who
wrestled
on
all
thirteen
NEVER
events
.


On
October
5
,
2012
,
NJPW
announced
that
NEVER
was
going
to
get
its
own
championship
,
the
NEVER
Openweight
Championship
.


The
title
was
originally
scheduled
to
be
defended
exclusively
at
NEVER
events
,
but
this
plan
was
quickly
changed
and
since
its
foundation
,
the
title
has
been
defended
on
the
undercards
of
NJPW
events
.


NJPW
has
not
held
a
single
NEVER
event
since
the
tournament
,
which
crowned
the
first
NEVER
Openweight
Champion
on
November
19
,
2012
.


A
second
NEVER
title
,
the
NEVER
Openweight
6-Man
Tag
Team
Championship
,
was
announced
on
December
21
,
2015
,
with
the
first
champions
crowned
on
January
4
,
2016
.


On
July
18
,
2015
,
NJPW
announced
``
Lion
's
Gate
''
,
a
project
with
a
theme
similar
to
NEVER
,
which
held
its
first
show
on
February
25
,
2016
.

was
China
,
followed
by
Russia
;
hosts
Singapore
did
not
win
any
gold
medals
.


Most
unique
features
of
the
YOG
,
such
as
mixed-NOCs
teams
(
comprising

from
different
countries
)
and
the
Culture
and
Education
Programme
(

)
,
made
their
debut
at
the
2010

.


although
the
concept
dates
back
to
1998
,
formal
plans
for
the
yog
were
only
first
announced
at
the
119th
ioc
session
on
6
july
2007
.


On
2008
,
Singapore
was
selected
as
the
host
city
after
defeating
Moscow
53-44
in
a
postal
vote
by
105
International
Olympic
Committee
(
IOC
)
members
.


The
Singapore

Marina
Bay
hosted
the
opening
and
closing
ceremonies
and
the
Youth

The
Games
were
marred
by
discrepancies
in
the
budget
and
attendance
figures
,
two
wrestlers
caught
doping
,
a
walkover
in
the
taekwondo
final
and
allegations
that

,
was
fought
on
November
10
,
1808
,
during
the
Peninsular
War
in
the
village
of
Gamonal
,
near
Burgos
,
Spain
.


A
powerful
French
army
under
Marshal
Bessières
overwhelmed
and
destroyed
the
outnumbered
Spanish
troops
under
General
Belveder
,
opening
central
Spain
to
invasion
.


Spanish
history
remembers
this
battle
for
the
vain
gallantry
of
the
Guard
and
Walloon
regiments
under
Vicente
Genaro
de
Quesada
.


Forming
a
rearguard
for
the
shattered
Spanish
lines
,
these
troops
repelled
repeated
charges
by
General
Lasalle
's
.


The
cost
was
high
for
the
Spaniards
,
with
only
74
of
the
307
men
in
the
rearguard
surviving
.


It
is
said
that
Bessières
personally
returned
Quesada
's
sword
and
had
his
wounds
treated
in
the
French
field
hospital
.


These
acts
of
chivalry
became
increasingly
rare
as
the
Peninsular
War
dragged
on
.


The
White
Night
riots
were
a
series
of
violent
events
sparked
by
an
announcement
of
a
lenient
sentencing
of
Dan
White
for
the
assassinations
of
San
Francisco
Mayor
George
Moscone
and
of
Harvey
Milk
,
a
member
of
the
city
's
Board
of
Supervisors
who
was
one
of
the
first
openly
gay
elected
officials
in
the
United
States
.


The
events
took
place
on
the
night
of
May
21
,
1979
(
the
night
before
what
would
have
been
Milk
's
49th
birthday
)
in
San
Francisco
.


Earlier
that
day
,
White
had
been
convicted
of
voluntary
manslaughter
,
the
lightest
possible
conviction
for
his
actions
.


That
White
was
not
convicted
of
first-degree
murder
(
of
which
he
was
originally
charged
)
had
so
outraged
the
city
's
gay
community
that
it
set
off
the
most
violent
reaction
by
gay
Americans
since
the
1969
Stonewall
Riots
in
New
York
City
(
which
is
credited
as
the
beginning
of
the
modern
gay
rights
movement
in
the
United
States
)
.


The
gay
community
of
San
Francisco
had
a
longstanding
conflict
with
the
San
Francisco
Police
Department
.


White
's
status
as
a
former
police
officer
intensified
the
community
's
anger
at
the
SFPD
.


Initial
demonstrations
took
place
as
a
peaceful
march
through
the
Castro
district
of
San
Francisco
.


After
the
crowd
arrived
at
the
San
Francisco
City
Hall
,
violence
began
.


The
events
caused
hundreds
of
thousands
of
dollars
worth
of
property
damage
to
City
Hall
and
the
surrounding
area
,
as
well
as
injuries
to
police
officers
and
rioters
.


Several
hours
after
the
riot
had
been
broken
up
,
police
made
a
retaliatory
raid
on
a
gay
bar
in
San
Francisco
's
Castro
District
.


Many
patrons
were
beaten
by
police
in
riot
gear
.


Two
dozen
arrests
were
made
during
the
course
of
the
raid
,
and
several
people
later
sued
the
SFPD
.


In
the
following
days
,
gay
leaders
refused
to
apologize
for
the
events
of
that
night
.


This
led
to
increased
political
power
in
the
gay
community
,
which
culminated
in
the
election
of
Mayor
Dianne
Feinstein
to
a
full
term
the
following
November
.


In
response
to
a
campaign
promise
,
Feinstein
appointed
a
pro-gay
Chief
of
Police
,
which
increased
recruitment
of
gay
people
in
the
police
force
and
eased
tensions
.


The
La
Mon
restaurant
bombing
was
an
incendiary
bomb
attack
by
the
Provisional
Irish
Republican
Army
(
IRA
)
on
17
February
1978
that
is
described
as
one
of
the
worst
atrocities
of
the
Troubles
.


it
took
place
at
the
la
mon
house
hotel
and
restaurant
near
belfast
.


The
IRA
left
a
large
incendiary
bomb
,
containing
a
napalm-like
substance
,
outside
one
of
the
restaurant
's
windows
.


There
were
450
diners
,
hotel
staff
and
guests
inside
the
building
.


The
IRA
members
state
that
they
then
tried
to
send
a
warning
from
a
public
telephone
,
but
were
unable
to
do
so
until
nine
minutes
before
the
bomb
detonated
.


The
blast
created
a
fireball
,
killing
twelve
people
and
injuring
thirty
more
,
many
of
whom
were
severely
burnt
.


Many
of
the
injured
were
treated
in
the
Ulster
Hospital
in
nearby
Dundonald
.


A
Belfast
native
,
Robert
Murphy
,
received
twelve
life
sentences
for
the
manslaughter
of
those
who
were
killed
.


Murphy
was
freed
from
prison
on
licence
in
1995
.


In
the
Siege
of
Hüningen
(
27
November
1796
–
1
February
1797
)
,
the
Austrians
captured
the
city
from
the
French
.


Hüningen
is
in
the
present-day
Department
of
Haut-Rhin
,
France
.


Its
fortress
lay
approximately
north
of
the
Swiss
city
of
Basel
and
north
of
the
spot
where
the
present-day
borders
of
Germany
,
France
and
Switzerland
meet
.


During
the
time
of
this
siege
,
the
village
was
part
of
the
Canton
of
Basel
City
and
the
fortress
lay
in
area
contested
between
the
German
states
and
the
First
French
Republic
.


The
siege
occurred
within
the
French
Revolutionary
Wars
during
which
Revolutionary
France
ranged
itself
against
a
Coalition
that
included
most
of
the
states
with
which
it
shared
land
or
water
borders
.


In
particular
,
France
was
at
odds
with
the
European
monarchies
,
who
initially
feared
for
the
safety
of
Louis
XVI
and
his
wife
,
who
was
the
sister
of
the
Holy
Roman
Emperor
.


Fighting
,
which
began
in
1792
,
had
been
inconclusive
.


Fighting
in
1795
had
largely
favored
the
Coalition
;
the
Campaign
in
the
Rhineland
in
1796
,
though
,
had
pushed
the
Coalition
forces
far
into
the
German
states
;
the
Coalition
forces
had
pushed
back
and
,
at
the
end
of
the
summer
's
fighting
in
1796
,
the
Austrian
force
under
command
of
Archduke
Charles
had
succeeded
in
pushing
the
French
back
to
the
Rhine
.


With
the
conclusion
of
the
Battle
of
Schliengen
on
24
October
,
the
French
army
withdrew
south
and
west
toward
the
Rhine
.


Forces
commanded
by
Jean
Charles
Abbatucci
and
Pierre
Marie
Barthélemy
Ferino
provided
the
rear
guard
support
and
the
main
force
retreated
across
the
Rhine
into
France
.


The
French
retained
control
of
the
fortifications
at
Kehl
and
Hüningen
and
,
more
importantly
,
the
``
tête-du-ponts
''
(
bridgeheads
)
of
the
star-shaped
fortresses
where
the
bridges
crossed
the
Rhine
.


The
French
chief
commander
,
Jean
Victor
Moreau
,
offered
an
armistice
to
the
Austrian
commander
,
which
the
archduke
was
inclined
to
accept
.


He
wanted
to
secure
the
Rhine
crossings
and
then
send
troops
to
northern
Italy
to
relieve
Dagobert
Sigmund
von
Wurmser
at
besieged
Mantua
;
an
armistice
with
Moreau
would
allow
him
to
do
that
.


However
,
his
brother
,
Francis
II
,
the
Holy
Roman
Emperor
,
and
the
civilian
military
advisers
of
the
Aulic
Council
categorically
refused
such
an
armistice
,
forcing
Charles
to
order
simultaneous
sieges
at
Kehl
and
Hüningen
.


These
tied
his
army
to
the
Rhine
for
most
of
the
winter
.


He
himself
moved
north
with
the
bulk
of
his
force
to
invest
the
larger
crossing
at
Kehl
,
and
instructed
Karl
Aloys
zu
Fürstenberg
to
conduct
the
siege
in
the
south
by
Basel
.


While
the
Austrians
besieged
these
Rhine
crossings
,
Moreau
had
sufficient
surplus
troops
to
send
14
demi-brigades
(
approximately
12,000
troops
)
into
Italy
to
assist
in
the
siege
at
Mantua
.


Fürstenberg
's
force
initiated
the
siege
within
days
of
the
Austrian
victory
at
the
Battle
of
Schliengen
.


Most
of
the
siege
ran
concurrently
with
the
siege
at
Kehl
,
which
concluded
on
9
January
1797
.


By
the
time
troops
engaged
at
Kehl
marched
to
Hüningen
in
preparation
for
a
major
assault
,
Fürstenberg
had
established
extensive
earthworks
,
built
three
large
batteries
that
rained
continuous
cannonades
into
the
fortress
.


The
Habsburgs
repelled
a
French
sortie
in
early
December
in
which
Abbatucci
,
the
French
commander
,
was
killed
.


His
replacement
,
Georges
Joseph
Dufour
,
capitulated
on
1
February
1797
,
preventing
a
costly
assault
,
and
the
French
evacuated
,
taking
everything
of
value
that
remained
with
them
.


Like
the
conclusion
of
the
siege
at
Hüningen
,
the
Austrians
took
possession
of
a
pile
of
rubble
.


The
Lost
Battalion
is
the
name
given
to
the
nine
companies
of
the
77th
Division
,
roughly
554
men
,
isolated
by
German
forces
during
World
War
I
after
an
American
attack
in
the
Argonne
Forest
in
October
1918
.


Roughly
197
were
killed
in
action
and
approximately
150
missing
or
taken
prisoner
before
the
194
remaining
men
were
rescued
.


They
were
led
by
Major
Charles
W.
Whittlesey
.


On
2
October
,
the
77th
launched
an
attack
into
the
Argonne
,
under
the
belief
that
French
forces
were
supporting
their
left
flank
and
two
American
units
including
the
92nd
Infantry
Division
were
supporting
their
right
.


Within
the
77th
sector
some
units
including
Whittlesey
's
1-308th
Infantry
were
making
significant
headway
.


Unknown
to
Whittlesey
's
unit
,
the
units
to
their
left
and
right
had
been
stalled
.


Without
this
knowledge
,
the
units
that
would
become
known
as
the
Lost
Battalion
moved
beyond
the
rest
of
the
Allied
line
and
found
themselves
surrounded
by
German
forces
.


For
the
next
six
days
,
suffering
heavy
losses
,
the
men
of
the
Lost
Battalion
and
the
American
units
desperate
to
relieve
them
would
fight
an
intense
battle
in
the
Argonne
Forest
.


The
battalion
suffered
many
hardships
.


Food
was
scarce
and
water
was
available
only
by
crawling
,
under
fire
,
to
a
nearby
stream
.


Ammunition
ran
low
.


Communications
were
also
a
problem
,
and
at
times
they
would
be
bombarded
by
shells
from
their
own
artillery
.


As
every
runner
dispatched
by
Whittlesey
either
became
lost
or
ran
into
German
patrols
,
carrier
pigeons
became
the
only
method
of
communicating
with
headquarters
.


In
an
infamous
incident
on
4
October
,
inaccurate
coordinates
were
delivered
by
one
of
the
pigeons
and
the
unit
was
subjected
to
friendly
fire
.


The
unit
was
saved
by
another
pigeon
,
Cher
Ami
,
delivering
the
following
message
:
WE
ARE
ALONG
THE
ROAD
276.4
.


OUR
ARTILLERY
IS
DROPPING
A
BARRAGE
DIRECTLY
ON
US
.


FOR
HEAVENS
SAKE
STOP
IT
.


Despite
this
,
they
held
their
ground
and
caused
enough
of
a
distraction
for
other
Allied
units
to
break
through
the
German
lines
,
which
forced
the
Germans
to
retreat
.


The
North-Western
Area
Campaign
was
an
air
campaign
fought
between
the
Allied
and
Japanese
air
forces
over
northern
Australia
and
the
Netherlands
East
Indies
(
NEI
)
between
1942
and
1945
.


The
campaign
began
with
the
Japanese
bombing
of
Darwin
on
19
February
1942
and
continued
until
the
end
of
the
war
.


while
the
japanese
attack
on
darwin
inflicted
heavy
damage
on
the
royal
australian
air
force
(
raaf
)
base
there
,
the
allies
quickly
recovered
.


Darwin
was
reinforced
to
meet
the
perceived
threat
of
invasion
and
additional
airfields
were
built
to
the
south
of
the
town
.


By
October
1942
the
RAAF
's
North-Western
Area
Command
had
been
built
up
to
six
squadrons
,
and
was
conducting
daily
attacks
on
Japanese
positions
in
the
NEI
.


the
allied
force
continued
to
expand
in
1943
with
the
arrival
of
united
states
army
air
forces
b-24
liberator
heavy
bomber
units
,
australian
and
british
spitfire
squadrons
and
australian
and
dutch
medium
bomber
squadrons
.


The
Spitfires
inflicted
substantial
losses
on
Japanese
raiders
as
North-Western
Area
stepped
up
its
attacks
on
Japanese
positions
.


RAAF

successfully
laid

Cyclone
Leon–Eline
was
the
longest-lived
Indian
Ocean
tropical
cyclone
on
record
,
traveling
over
during
its
29‑day
duration
.


The
cyclone
formed
on
February
1
,
2000
,
in
the
Australian
basin
as
Tropical
Cyclone
Leon
,
and
was
renamed
``
Eline
''
after
crossing
90°
E
into
the
South-West
Indian
Ocean
;
there
,
the
Météo-France
office
in
Réunion
(
MFR
)
tracked
the
storm
's
movement
and
intensity
.


Late
on
February
17
,
Eline
made
landfall
near
Mahanoro
,
Madagascar
,
with
10‑minute
winds
of
.


The
storm
rapidly
weakened
over
land
,
but
restrengthened
in
the
Mozambique
Channel
to
reach
peak
10‑minute
winds
of
,
making
it
an
intense
tropical
cyclone
.


On
February
22
,
Eline
made
landfall
about
south
of
Beira
,
Mozambique
,
near
peak
intensity
.


Eline
quickly
weakened
over
land
as
it
moved
across
Southern
Africa
,
finally
dissipating
over
eastern
Namibia
on
February
29
.


While
moving
across
much
of
the
Indian
Ocean
,
Eline
brought
high
waves
,
gusty
winds
,
and
rainfall
to
several
islands
.


When
Eline
struck
Madagascar
,
the
country
was
in
the
midst
of
a
cholera
epidemic
that
killed
over
1,000
people
.


Eline
directly
killed
at
least
64
people
in
the
country
.


tropical
storm
gloria
struck
madagascar
13
days
later
,
compounding
the
damage
and
making
it
difficult
to
discern
the
individual
effects
.


Damage
from
Eline
was
estimated
at
$
9
million
(
USD
)
,
and
collectively
the
two
storms
killed
205
people
and
left
another
10,000
homeless
.


In
the
region
around
Vatomandry
where
Eline
made
landfall
,
65
%
of
houses
were
damaged
,
90
%
of
crops
were
lost
,
and
75
%
of
health
facilities
were
wrecked
.


Before
Eline
's
final
landfall
,
Mozambique
's
worst
floods
since
1951
had
killed
about
150
people
.


The
additional
rainfall
and
flooding
from
Eline
created
the
country
's
worst
natural
disaster
in
a
century
,
and
disrupted
ongoing
relief
efforts
.


The
combined
effects
destroyed
over
of
crop
fields
and
killed
40,000
cattle
.


The
Limpopo
River
reached
wide
and
above
normal
in
some
areas
,
which
isolated
the
town
of
Xai-Xai
.


A
dam
broke
along
the
river
,
flooding
the
town
of
Chokwe
in
the
middle
of
the
night
and
trapping
several
unprepared
residents
;
this
accounted
for
nearly
half
of
the
death
toll
.


About
55
people
drowned
in
Sofala
Province
after
rescue
helicopters
arrived
too
late
to
save
them
.


Around
20,000
people
in
the
capital
city
of
Maputo
lost
their
homes
.


In
addition
to
the
floods
,
strong
winds
blew
away
many
roofs
and
some
entire
houses
made
of
mud
.


The
combined
effects
of
the
preceding
floods
and
Eline
left
about
329,000
people
displaced
or
homeless
,
killed
around
700
people
,
and
caused
an
estimated
$
500
million
(
USD
)
in
damage
.


The
flooding
disrupted
much
of
the
economic
progress
Mozambique
had
made
in
the
1990s
since
the
end
of
its
civil
war
.


Elsewhere
in
Southern
Africa
,
Eline
brought
strong
winds
and
heavy
rainfall
when
it
crossed
into
eastern
Zimbabwe
.


Rivers
overflowed
their
banks
in
the
country
,
damaging
crops
and
houses
while
leaving
15,000
people
homeless
.


The
storm
killed
12
people
in
the
country
.


Flooding
from
the
storm
extended
southward
into
Swaziland
and
South
Africa
.


In
the
latter
country
,
Eline
dropped
of
rainfall
in
Levubu
over
three
days
,
causing
the
Limpopo
River
to
reach
its
highest
level
in
15
years
.


Officials
opened
dams
along
the
river
to
prevent
structural
damage
,
which
caused
higher
levels
along
the
river
to
the
east
.


at
least
21
people
died
in
the
country
,
and
about
80,000
people
were
left
homeless
.

The
Dutch
Revolt
(
1568–1648
)
was
the
revolt
of
the
northern
,
largely
Protestant
Seven
Provinces
of
the
Low
Countries
against
the
rule
of
the
Roman
Catholic
Habsburg
King
Philip
II
of
Spain
,
hereditary
ruler
of
the
provinces
.


The
northern
provinces
(
Netherlands
)
eventually
separated
from
the
southern
provinces
(
present-day
Belgium
and
Luxembourg
)
,
which
continued
under
Habsburg
Spain
until
1714
.


The
religious
``
clash
of
cultures
''
built
up
gradually
but
inexorably
into
outbursts
of
violence
against
the
perceived
repression
of
the
Habsburg
Crown
.


These
tensions
led
to
the
formation
of
the
independent
Dutch
Republic
,
whose
first
leader
was
William
the
Silent
(
William
of
Orange
)
,
followed
by
several
of
his
descendants
and
relations
.


This
revolt
was
one
of
the
first
successful
secessions
in
Europe
,
and
led
to
one
of
the
first
European
republics
of
the
modern
era
,
the
``
United
Provinces
''
.


King
Philip
was
initially
successful
in
suppressing
the
rebellion
.


In
1572
,
however
,
the
rebels
captured
Brielle
and
the
rebellion
resurged
.


The
northern
provinces
became
independent
,
first
in
1581
``
de
facto
''
,
and
in
1648
``
de
jure
''
.


During
the
revolt
,
the
United
Provinces
of
the
Netherlands
,
better
known
as
the
Dutch
Republic
,
rapidly
grew
to
become
a
world
power
through
its
merchant
shipping
and
experienced
a
period
of
economic
,
scientific
,
and
cultural
growth
.


The
Southern
Netherlands
(
situated
in
modern-day
:
southern
Netherlands
,
Belgium
,
Luxembourg
and
northern
France
)
remained
under
Spanish
rule
.


The
continuous
heavy-handed
rule
by
the
Habsburgs
in
the
south
caused
many
of
its
financial
,
intellectual
,
and
cultural
elite
to
flee
north
,
contributing
to
the
success
of
the
Dutch
Republic
.


The
Dutch
imposed
a
rigid
blockade
on
the
southern
provinces
that
prevented
Baltic
grain
from
relieving
famine
in
the
southern
towns
,
especially
from
1587
to
1589
.


By
the
end
of
the
war
in
1648
,
large
areas
of
the
Southern
Netherlands
had
been
lost
to
France
,
which
had
,
under
the
guidance
of
Cardinal
Richelieu
and
Louis
XIII
of
France
,
allied
itself
with
the
Dutch
Republic
in
the
1630s
against
Spain
.


The
first
phase
of
the
conflict
can
be
considered
the
Dutch
War
of
Independence
.


The
focus
of
the
latter
phase
was
to
gain
official
recognition
of
the
already
``
de
facto
''
independence
of
the
United
Provinces
.


This
phase
coincided
with
the
rise
of
the
Dutch
Republic
as
a
major
power
and
the
founding
of
the
Dutch
Empire
.


The
Kano
1980
riot
was
a
riot
in
Kano
,
Nigeria
led
by
Maitatsine
and
his
followers
and
the
first
major
religious
conflict
in
postcolonial
Kano
.


over
4,177
civilians
,
100
policemen
and
about
35
military
personnel
were
killed
including
unk
himself
,
and
is
generally
regarded
as
marking
the
beginning
of
the
yan
unk
insurgency
.


Because
of
this
,
there
was
widespread
impression
that
Nigeria
's
security
and
economy
was
threatened
by
illegal
aliens
and
this
belief
was
fueled
by
the
fact
that
other
West
African
nationals
had
aided
in
armed
robberies
.


Illegal
aliens
from
Niger
,
Chad
,
Cameroon
,
Mali
and
Burkina
Faso
along
with
over
6,000
Nigerian
Muslim
fanatics
killed
over
100
policemen
while
injuring
100
policemen
.


The
army
was
called
and
alleviated
the
situation
before
the
fanatics
could
overrun
the
country
.


However
,
official
sources
state
that
illegal
aliens
did
not
cause
the
trouble
.


The
Battle
of
San
Lorenzo
was
fought
on
February
3
,
1813
in
San
Lorenzo
,
Argentina
,
then
part
of
the
United
Provinces
of
the
Río
de
la
Plata
.


A
Spanish
royalist
force
under
the
command
of
Antonio
Zabala
was
defeated
by
the
Regiment
of
Mounted
Grenadiers
,
under
the
command
of
José
de
San
Martín
.


This
battle
was
the
baptism
of
fire
for
this
military
unit
,
and
for
San
Martín
in
the
Spanish
American
wars
of
independence
.


Montevideo
,
a
royalist
stronghold
during
the
Argentine
War
of
Independence
,
was
under
siege
by
José
Gervasio
Artigas
.


Those
in
the
city
raided
population
centres
along
the
nearby
rivers
for
supplies
.


San
Martín
,
who
shortly
before
had
arrived
in
Buenos
Aires
and
formed
the
regiment
,
followed
the
royalist
ships
to
San
Lorenzo
.


The
area
around
San
Lorenzo
formed
a
large
empty
plain
,
so
the
regiment
hid
inside
the
San
Carlos
convent
during
the
night
and
San
Martín
studied
the
battlefield
and
the
enemy
ships
from
the
tower
.


The
battle
started
at
dawn
,
when
the
grenadiers
made
a
surprise
pincer
movement
to
trap
the
enemy
forces
.


One
column
was
led
by
San
Martín
,
and
the
other
by
Justo
Germán
Bermúdez
.


San
Martín
fell
from
his
horse
,
and
was
nearly
killed
,
but
Juan
Bautista
Cabral
and
Juan
Bautista
Baigorria
intervened
and
saved
him
.


The
royalists
were
defeated
,
but
continued
to
raid
villages
for
some
more
time
afterwards
.


This
battle
was
the
only
one
that
San
Martín
fought
in
the
modern
territory
of
Argentina
.


The
city
of
San
Lorenzo
keeps
historic
memorials
of
the
battle
and
it
is
referenced
in
the
San
Lorenzo
march

Gol
Transportes
Aéreos
Flight
1907
was
a
Boeing
737-8EH
on
a
scheduled
domestic
passenger
flight
from
Manaus
,
Brazil
,
to
Rio
de
Janeiro
.


On
the
afternoon
of
29
September
2006
,
it
collided
in
mid-air
with
an
Embraer
Legacy
600
business
jet
over
the
Brazilian
state
of
Mato
Grosso
.


The
Boeing
737
broke
up
in
mid-air
and
crashed
into
an
area
of
dense
jungle
,
killing
all
154
passengers
and
crew
on
board
.


Despite
sustaining
serious
damage
to
its
left
wing
and
tail
,
the
Embraer
Legacy
jet
landed
safely
with
its
seven
occupants
uninjured
.


The
accident
was
investigated
by
the
Brazilian
Aeronautical
Accidents
Investigation
and
Prevention
Center
(
(
CENIPA
)
)
and
the
U.S.
National
Transportation
Safety
Board
(
NTSB
)
,
and
a
final
report
was
issued
in
2008
.


CENIPA
concluded
that
the
accident
was
caused
by
air
traffic
control
(
ATC
)
errors
combined
with
mistakes
made
by
the
American
pilots
on
the
Legacy
,
while
the
NTSB
determined
that
both
flight
crews
acted
properly
and
were
placed
on
a
collision
course
by
ATC
,
deeming
the
Legacy
pilots
'
disabling
of
their
TCAS
system
to
be
only
a
contributing
factor
rather
than
a
direct
cause
.


The
accident
,
which
triggered
a
crisis
in
Brazilian
civil
aviation
,
was
the
deadliest
in
Brazil
's
aviation
history
at
the
time
.


It
remains
the
second
worst
plane
crash
in
Brazil
,
after
TAM
Airlines
Flight
3054
in
2007
.


On
August
23
,
2011
,
a
magnitude
5.8
earthquake
hit
the
Piedmont
region
of
the
Commonwealth
of
Virginia
,
United
States
,
at
1:51:04
p.m.
EDT
.


The
epicenter
,
in
Louisa
County
,
was
northwest
of
Richmond
and
south-southwest
of
the
town
of
Mineral
.


It
was
an
intraplate
earthquake
with
a
maximum
perceived
intensity
of
VII
(
``
Very
strong
''
)
on
the
Mercalli
intensity
scale
.


Several
aftershocks
,
ranging
up
to
4.5
in
magnitude
,
occurred
after
the
main
tremor
.


The
quake
was
felt
across
more
than
a
dozen
U.S.
states
and
in
several
Canadian
provinces
,
and
was
felt
by
more
people
than
any
other
quake
in
U.S.
history
.


No
deaths
and
only
minor
injuries
were
reported
.


Minor
and
moderate
damage
to
buildings
was
widespread
and
was
estimated
by
one
risk-modeling
company
at
$
200
million
to
$
300
million
,
of
which
about
$
100
million
was
insured
.


The
earthquake
prompted
research
that
revealed
that
the
farthest
landslide
from
the
epicenter
was
,
by
far
the
greatest
landslide
distance
recorded
from
any
other
earthquake
of
similar
magnitude
.


Previous
studies
of
worldwide
earthquakes
indicated
that
landslides
occurred
no
farther
than
from
the
epicenter
of
a
magnitude
5.8
earthquake
.


The
Virginia
earthquake
study
suggested
that
the
added
information
about
East
Coast
earthquakes
may
prompt
a
revision
of
equations
that
predict
ground
shaking
.


the
most
serious
coup
d'etat
against
the
government
of
philippine
president
corazon
aquino
was
staged
beginning
december
1
,
1989
,
by
members
of
the
armed
forces
of
the
philippines
belonging
to
the
reform
the
armed

movement
(
ram
)
and
soldiers
loyal
to

president
ferdinand
marcos
.


Metro
Manila
was
shaken
by
this
Christmas
coup
,
and
they
almost
seized
the
presidential
palace
.


It
was
completely
defeated
by
the
Philippine
government
by
December
9
,
1989
.


The
coup
was
led
by
Colonel
Gregorio
Honasan
,
General
Edgardo
Abenina
,
and

Zumel
,
and
staged
by

,
led
by
Honasan
,
and
troops
loyal
to
Marcos
,
led
by
Zumel
.


at
the
onset
of
the
coup
,
the
rebels
seized
villamor
airbase
,
fort
bonifacio
,
sangley
airbase
,
mactan
airbase
in
cebu
,
and
portions
of
camp
aguinaldo
.


The
rebels
set
patrols
around
the
runway
of
Ninoy
Aquino
International
Airport
effectively
shutting
it
down
.


From
Sangley
Airbase
,
the
rebels
launched
planes
and
helicopters
which
bombarded
and
strafed
Malacañan
Palace
,
Camp
Crame
and
Camp
Aguinaldo
.


Three
hours
after
the
fall
of
Villamor
Air
Base
,
Aquino
went
on
air
to
address
her
people
,
and
said
that
``
We
shall
smash
this
naked
attempt
once
more
''
.


at
that
point
the
government
counterattack
began
.


Seven
army
trucks
headed
for
Channel
4
,
and
fierce
fighting
occurred
there
.


Ramos
and
Renato
de
Villa
monitored
the
crises
from
Camp
Crame
,
the
Constabulary
headquarters
.


With
loyal
forces
hard-pressed
by
the
rebels
,
Aquino
requested
U.S.
Military
assistance
,
at
the
behest
of
her
military
commanders
,
and
it
was
granted
.


120
marines
,
part
of
an
800-strong
U.S.
contingent
stationed
at
Subic
Naval
Base
,
were
deployed
at
the
grounds
of
the
U.S.
Embassy
as
a
defensive
measure
.


President
Aquino
stated
that
the
loyal
forces
lacked
the
ability
to
contain
the
rebel
forces
.


American
help
was
crucial
to
the
Aquino
cause
,
clearing
the
skies
of
rebel
aircraft
and
allowing
loyalists
to
consolidate
their
forces
.


While
many
mutineers
surrendered
,
Aquino
declared
:
We
leave
them
two
choices
;
Surrender
or
die
.


Government
F-5
jets
sortied
and
challenged
rebel
planes
culminating
in
the
destruction
of
the
rebel
T-28
Trojans
.


Government
forces
recaptured
all
military
bases
save
for
Mactan
Airbase
by
December
3
,
but
rebel
forces
retreating
from
Fort
Bonifacio
occupied
22
high-rise
buildings
along
the
Ayala
business
area
in
Makati
.


The
government
claimed
the
coup
was
crushed
,
but
fierce
fighting
continued
through
the
weekend
,
with
Camp
Aguinaldo
set
ablaze
by
the
rebel
howitzers
.


The
occupation
of
Makati
lasted
until
December
7
,
while
the
rebels
surrendered
Mactan
Airbase
on
December
9
.


The

the
report
became
known
as
the
davide

.


Participants
of
the
December
1989
coup
later
blamed
perceived
deficiencies
in
the
Aquino
government
in
areas
such
as
graft
and
corruption
,
bureaucratic
inefficiency
,
and
lenient
treatment
of
communist
insurgents
as
the
reasons
for
the
coup
.


in
response
,
the
davide
commission
recommended
several
short-term
and
long-term
counter-measures
,
including
the
establishment
of
a
civilian
national
police
force
,
a
crackdown
on

military
,
a

The
Wakefield
massacre
occurred
on
December
26
,
2000
,
at
Edgewater
Technology
in
Wakefield
,
Massachusetts
.


Michael
McDermott
,
an
application
support
employee
,
shot
and
killed
seven
co-workers
.


The
weapons
he
used
were
an
AK-47
variant
,
a
12-gauge
shotgun
,
and
a
.32
caliber
pistol
.


He
fired
off
a
total
of
37
rounds
,
shooting
his
victims
in
the
back
of
the
head
repeatedly
.


Police
later
found
a
.460-calibre
Weatherby
Mark
V
rifle
at
the
defendant
's
work
station
.


He
was
found
by
police
sitting
calmly
and
stated
that
he
did
not
speak
German
.


At
trial
,
he
stated
that
he
was
born
without
a
soul
and
that
God
had
allowed
him
to
earn
a
soul
by
traveling
back
in
time
to
kill
Nazis
.


McDermott
claimed
he
had
``
traveled
back
in
time
and
killed
Hitler
and
the
last
6
Nazis
.
''


However
,
the
prosecution
asserted
that
the
killings
were
motivated
by
his
employer
's
garnishment
of
his
wages
for
the
IRS
,
to
pay
back
taxes
that
he
owed
.


Evidence
also
showed
he
had
researched
how
to
fake
mental
illness
.


McDermott
was
found
guilty
of
seven
counts
of
first
degree
murder

He
was
sentenced

a
British/American
aerial

attack
on

,
during

air
force
(

dropped
more
than
3,900
tons
of
high-explosive
bombs
and
incendiary
devices
on
the
city
.


The
bombing
and
the
resulting
firestorm
destroyed
over

the
city
centre
.


An
estimated
22,700
to
25,000
people
were
killed
,
although
larger
casualty
figures
have
been
claimed
.


Three
more
USAAF

raids
followed
,

March
aimed
at
the
city

railway
marshalling
yard
and
one
smaller
raid
on
17

aimed
at
industrial
areas
.


Immediate
German
propaganda
claims
following
the
attacks
and
post-war
discussions
on
whether
the
attacks
were
justified
have
led
to
the
bombing
becoming
one
of
the
moral
``

a

justified
bombing
of
a
strategic
target
,
which
they
noted
was
a
major
rail
transport
and
communication
centre
,
housing
110
factories
and
50,000
workers
in
support
of
the
german
war
effort
.


Several
researchers
claim
not
all
of
the
communications
infrastructure
,
such
as
the
bridges
,
were
targeted
,
nor
were
the
extensive
industrial
areas
outside
the
city
center
.


Critics
of
the
bombing
have
claimed
that
Dresden
was
a
cultural
landmark
of
little
or
no
strategic
significance
,
and
that
the
attacks
were
indiscriminate
area
bombing
and
not
proportionate
to
the
military
gains
.


Some
in
the
German
far-right
refer
to
the
bombing
as
a
mass
murder
,
calling
it
``
Dresden
's
Holocaust
of
bombs
''
.


Large
variations
in
the
claimed
death
toll
have
fuelled
the
controversy
.


In
March
1945
,
the
German
government
ordered
its
press
to
publish
a
falsified
casualty
figure
of
200,000
for
the
Dresden
raids
,
and
death
toll
estimates
as
high
as
500,000
have
been
given
.


The
city
authorities
at
the
time
estimated
up
to
25,000
victims
,
a
figure
that
subsequent
investigations
supported
,
including
a
2010
study
commissioned
by
the
city
council
.


The
murder
of
Ann
Ogilby
,
also
known
as
the
``
Romper
Room
murder
''
,
took
place
in
Sandy
Row
,
south
Belfast
,
Northern
Ireland
on
24
July
1974
.


It
was
a
punishment
killing
,
carried
out
by
members
of
the
Sandy
Row
women
's
Ulster
Defence
Association
(
UDA
)
unit
.


At
the
time
the
UDA
was
a
legal
Ulster
loyalist
paramilitary
organisation
.


The
victim
,
Ann
Ogilby
,
a
Protestant
single
mother
of
four
,
was
beaten
to
death
by
two
teenaged
girls
after
being
sentenced
to
a
``
rompering
''
(
UDA
slang
term
for
a
torture
session
followed
by
a
fatal
beating
)
at
a
kangaroo
court
.


Ogilby
had
been
having
an
affair
with
a
married
UDA
commander
,
William
Young
,
who
prior
to
his
internment
,
had
made
her
pregnant
.


His
wife
,
Elizabeth
Young
,
was
a
member
of
the
Sandy
Row
women
's
UDA
unit
.


Ogilby
had
made
defamatory
remarks
against
Elizabeth
Young
in
public
regarding
food
parcels
.


Eight
weeks
after
Ogilby
had
given
birth
to
Young
's
son
,
the
women
's
unit
decided
that
Ogilby
would
pay
for
both
the
affair
and
remarks
with
her
life
.


The
day
following
the
kangaroo
court
``
trial
''
,
they
arranged
for
the
kidnapping
of
Ogilby
and
her
six-year-old
daughter
,
Sharlene
,
outside
a
Social
Services
office
by
UDA
man
Albert
``
Bumper
''
Graham
.


A
group
of
UDA
women
then
followed
the
minibus
which
brought
Ogilby
and
Sharlene
to
a
disused
bakery
in
Hunter
Street
,
Sandy
Row
;
this
empty
building
had
been
converted
into
a
UDA
club
and
``
romper
room
''
.


After
Sharlene
was
sent
by
Graham
to
a
shop
to
buy
sweets
,
Ogilby
was
made
to
sit
on
a
bench
and
a
hood
placed
over
her
head
.


Two
teenagers
,
Henrietta
Cowan
and
Christine
Smith
,
acting
on
the
orders
previously
given
them
by
the
unit
's
leader
,
Elizabeth
``
Lily
''
Douglas
,
proceeded
to
savagely
beat
Ogilby
to
death
with
bricks
and
sticks
.


As
Ogilby
screamed
and
pleaded
for
her
life
,
Sharlene
,
who
had
already
returned
from
the
shop
,
overheard
her
mother
being
beaten
and
killed
.


A
later
autopsy
report
revealed
that
Ogilby
had
sustained
24
blows
to
the
head
and
body
,
14
of
which
caused
a
``
severe
fracture
to
the
bulk
of
the
skull
''
.


Within
weeks
of
the
killing
,
ten
women
and
one
man
were
arrested
in
connection
with
the
murder
.


They
were
convicted
in
February
1975
.


All
but
one
,
a
minor
whose
sentence
was
suspended
,
went
to
prison
.


The
murder
caused
widespread
revulsion
,
shock
and
horror
throughout
Northern
Ireland
and
remained
long
in
the
public
psyche
even
at
a
time
when
bombings
and
killings
were
daily
occurrences
.


the
ann
ogilby
murder
was
investigated
by
the
historical
enquiries
team
(
het
)
which
was
established
by
the
police
service
of
northern
ireland
(
psni
)
to
investigate
the
most
controversial
killings
carried
out
during
the
troubles
.


The
Verkhovna
Rada
of
Ukraine
of
the
8th
convocation
(
,
)
was
a
convocation
of
the
legislative
branch
of
the
Verkhovna
Rada
,
Ukraine
's
unicameral
parliament
.


The
8th
convocation
met
at
the
Verkhovna
Rada
building
in
Kiev
,
having
begun
its
term
on
27
November
2014
following
the
last
session
of
the
7th
Verkhovna
Rada
.


Its
term
lasted
five
years
and
closed
its
last
session
on
24
July
2019
.


The
8th
Verkhovna
Rada
's
composition
was
based
upon
the
results
of
the
October
26
,
2014
parliamentary
election
,
which
was
contested
eight
months
after
the
2014
Ukrainian
revolution
which
saw
the
overthrow
of
the
Yanukovych
regime
.


Ukraine
's
head
of
state
during
the
parliament
's
term
is
President
Petro
Poroshenko
.


Eleven
parties
were
represented
in
the
Verkhovna
Rada
,
although
only
six
of
them
surpassed
the
mandatory
five
percent
election
threshold
to
gain
representation
based
upon
the
proportional
representation
system
.


on
the
first
day
of
the
parliament
's
session
,
five
of
the
parliament
's
pro-european
parties
,
the
petro
poroshenko
bloc
,
people
's
front
,
self
reliance
,
fatherland
,
and
radical
party
,
signed
a
coalition
agreement
.


Per
the
coalition
agreement
,
the
convocation
of
parliament
was
tasked
with
passing
major
reforms
to
ensure
Ukrainian
membership
in
European
institutions
such
as
the
European
Union
and
NATO
,
while
dealing
with
the
threat
of
further
Russian
aggression
in
the
Donbass
.


the
french
revolutionary
wars
were
a
series
of
sweeping
military
conflicts
lasting
from
1792
until
1802
and
resulting
from
the
french
revolution
.


They
pitted
France
against
Great
Britain
,
Austria
,
Prussia
,
Russia
and
several
other
monarchies
.


They
are
divided
in
two
periods
:
the
War
of
the
First
Coalition
(
1792–97
)
and
the
War
of
the
Second
Coalition
(
1798–1802
)
.


Initially
confined
to
Europe
,
the
fighting
gradually
assumed
a
global
dimension
.


After
a
decade
of
constant
warfare
and
aggressive
diplomacy
,
France
had
conquered
a
wide
array
of
territories
,
from
the
Italian
Peninsula
and
the
Low
Countries
in
Europe
to
the
Louisiana
Territory
in
North
America
.


French
success
in
these
conflicts
ensured
the
spread
of
revolutionary
principles
over
much
of
Europe
.


As
early
as
1791
,
the
other
monarchies
of
Europe
looked
with
outrage
at
the
revolution
and
its
upheavals
;
and
they
considered
whether
they
should
intervene
,
either
in
support
of
King
Louis
XVI
,
to
prevent
the
spread
of
revolution
,
or
to
take
advantage
of
the
chaos
in
France
.


Anticipating
an
attack
,
France
declared
war
on
Prussia
and
Austria
in
the
spring
of
1792
and
they
responded
with
a
coordinated
invasion
that
was
eventually
turned
back
at
the
Battle
of
Valmy
in
September
.


This
victory
emboldened
the
National
Convention
to
abolish
the
monarchy
.


A
series
of
victories
by
the
new
French
armies
abruptly
ended
with
defeat
at
Neerwinden
in
the
spring
of
1793
.


The
French
suffered
additional
defeats
in
the
remainder
of
the
year
and
these
difficult
times
allowed
the
Jacobins
to
rise
to
power
and
impose
the
Reign
of
Terror
to
unify
the
nation
.


In
1794
,
the
situation
improved
dramatically
for
the
French
as
huge
victories
at
Fleurus
against
the
Austrians
and
at
the
Black
Mountain
against
the
Spanish
signaled
the
start
of
a
new
stage
in
the
wars
.


By
1795
,
the
French
had
captured
the
Austrian
Netherlands
and
knocked
Spain
and
Prussia
out
of
the
war
with
the
Peace
of
Basel
.


A
hitherto
unknown
general
named
Napoleon
Bonaparte
began
his
first
campaign
in
Italy
in
April
1796
.


In
less
than
a
year
,
French
armies
under
Napoleon
decimated
the
Habsburg
forces
and
evicted
them
from
the
Italian
peninsula
,
winning
almost
every
battle
and
capturing
150,000
prisoners
.


with
french
forces
marching
towards
vienna
,
the
austrians
sued
for
peace
and
agreed
to
the
treaty
of
campo
formio
,
ending
the
first
coalition
against
the
republic
.


The
War
of
the
Second
Coalition
began
in
1798
with
the
French
invasion
of
Egypt
,
headed
by
Napoleon
.


The
Allies
took
the
opportunity
presented
by
the
French
effort
in
the
Middle
East
to
regain
territories
lost
from
the
First
Coalition
.


The
war
began
well
for
the
Allies
in
Europe
,
where
they
gradually
pushed
the
French
out
of
Italy
and
invaded
Switzerland
–
racking
up
victories
at
Magnano
,
Cassano
and
Novi
along
the
way
.


However
,
their
efforts
largely
unraveled
with
the
French
victory
at
Zurich
in
September
1799
,
which
caused
Russia
to
drop
out
of
the
war
.


meanwhile
,
napoleon
's
forces
annihilated
a
series
of
egyptian
and
ottoman
armies
at
the
battles
of
the
pyramids
,
mount
tabor
and
abukir
.


These
victories
and
the
conquest
of
Egypt
further
enhanced
Napoleon
's
popularity
back
in
France
,
and
he
returned
in
triumph
in
the
fall
of
1799
.


However
,
the
Royal
Navy
had
won
the
Battle
of
the
Nile
in
1798
,
further
strengthening
British
control
of
the
Mediterranean
.


Napoleon
's
arrival
from
Egypt
led
to
the
fall
of
the
Directory
in
the
Coup
of
18
Brumaire
,
with
Napoleon
installing
himself
as
Consul
.


Napoleon
then
reorganized
the
French
army
and
launched
a
new
assault
against
the
Austrians
in
Italy
during
the
spring
of
1800
.


This
brought
a
decisive
French
victory
at
the
Battle
of
Marengo
in
June
1800
,
after
which
the
Austrians
withdrew
from
the
peninsula
once
again
.


another
crushing
french
triumph
at
hohenlinden
in
bavaria
forced
the
austrians
to
seek
peace
for
a
second
time
,
leading
to
the
treaty
of
UNK
in
1801
.


with
austria
and
russia
out
of
the
war
,
the
united
kingdom
found
itself
increasingly
isolated
and
agreed
to
the
treaty
of
amiens
with
napoleon
's
government
in
1802
,
concluding
the
revolutionary
wars
.


However
,
the
lingering
tensions
proved
too
difficult
to
contain
,
and
the
Napoleonic
Wars
began
over
a
year
later
with
the
formation
of
the
Third
Coalition
,
continuing
the
series
of
Coalition
Wars
.


A
series
of
sit-in
street
protests
,
often
called
the
Umbrella
Revolution
(
)
and
sometimes
used
interchangeably
with
Umbrella
Movement
(
)
,
or
Occupy
Movement
(
)
,
occurred
in
Hong
Kong
from
26
September
to
15
December
2014
.


The
protests
began
after
the
Standing
Committee
of
the
National
People
's
Congress
(
NPCSC
)
issued
a
decision
regarding
proposed
reforms
to
the
Hong
Kong
electoral
system
.


the
decision
was
widely
seen
to
be
highly
restrictive
,
and
tantamount
to
the
chinese
communist
party
(
ccp
)
's
pre-screening
of
the
candidates
for
the
chief
executive
of
hong
kong
.


Students
led
a
strike
against
the
NPCSC
's
decision
beginning
on
22
September
2014
,
and
the
Hong
Kong
Federation
of
Students
and
Scholarism
started
protesting
outside
the
government
headquarters
on
26
September
2014
.


On
28
September
,
events
developed
rapidly
.


The
Occupy
Central
with
Love
and
Peace
movement
announced
the
beginning
of
their
civil
disobedience
campaign
.


Students
and
other
members
of
the
public
demonstrated
outside
government
headquarters
,
and
some
began
to
occupy
several
major
city
intersections
.


Protesters
blocked
both
east–west
arterial
routes
in
northern
Hong
Kong
Island
near
Admiralty
.


Police
tactics
–
including
the
use
of
tear
gas
–
and
triad
attacks
on
protesters
led
more
citizens
to
join
the
protests
and
to
occupy
Causeway
Bay
and
Mong
Kok
.


The
number
of
protesters
peaked
at
more
than
100,000
at
any
given
time
,
overwhelming
the
police
thus
causing
containment
errors
.


Government
officials
in
Hong
Kong
and
in
Beijing
denounced
the
occupation
as
``
illegal
''
and
a
``
violation
of
the
rule
of
law
''
,
and
Chinese
state
media
and
officials
claimed
repeatedly
that
the
West
had
played
an
``
instigating
''
role
in
the
protests
,
and
warned
of
``
deaths
and
injuries
and
other
grave
consequences
.
''


The
protests
precipitated
a
rift
in
Hong
Kong
society
,
and
galvanised
youth
–
a
previously
apolitical
section
of
society
–
into
political
activism
or
heightened
awareness
of
their
civil
rights
and
responsibilities
.


Not
only
were
there
fist
fights
at
occupation
sites
and
flame
wars
on
social
media
,
family
members
found
themselves
on
different
sides
of
the
conflict
.


Key
areas
in
Admiralty
,
Causeway
Bay
and
Mong
Kok
were
occupied
and
remained
closed
to
traffic
for
77
days
.


Despite
numerous
incidents
of
intimidation
and
violence
by
triads
and
thugs
,
particularly
in
Mong
Kok
,
and
several
attempts
at
clearance
by
the
police
,
suffragists
held
their
ground
for
over
two
months
.


After
the
Mong
Kok
occupation
site
was
cleared
with
some
scuffles
on
25
November
,
Admiralty
and
Causeway
Bay
were
cleared
with
no
opposition
on
11
and
14
December
,
respectively
.


The
Hong
Kong
government
's
use
of
the
police
and
courts
to
resolve
political
issues
led
to
accusations
that
these
institutions
had
been
turned
into
political
tools
,
thereby
compromising
the
police
and
judicial
system
in
the
territory
and
eroding
the
rule
of
law
in
favour
of
``
rule
by
law
''
.


At
times
violent
police
action
during
the
occupation
was
widely
perceived
to
have
damaged
the
reputation
of
what
was
once
recognised
as
one
of
the
most
efficient
,
honest
and
impartial
police
forces
in
the
Asia
Pacific
region
.


The
protests
ended
without
any
political
concessions
from
the
government
,
but
instead
triggered
rhetoric
from
Chief
Executive
of
Hong
Kong
CY
Leung
and
mainland
officials
about
rule
of
law
and
patriotism
,
and
an
assault
on
academic
freedoms
and
civil
liberties
of
activists
.


The
Cabanagem
(
;
1835–1840
)
was
a
popular
revolution
and
pro-separatist
movement
that
occurred
in
the
then-state
of
Grão-Pará
,
Empire
of
Brazil
.


Among
the
causes
for
this
revolt
were
the
extreme
poverty
of
the
Paraense
people
,
oppression
by
the
Empire
of
Brazil
,
and
the
political
irrelevance
to
which
the
province
was
relegated
after
the
independence
of
Brazil
.


The
name
``
Cabanagem
''
refers
to
the
type
of
hut
used
by
the
poorest
people
living
along
the
waterways
of
northern
Brazil
,
principally
caboclos
,
freed
slaves
,
and
indigenous
people
.


The
elite
agriculturists
of
Grão-Pará
,
while
living
much
better
,
resented
their
lack
of
participation
in
the
central
government
's
decision-making
,
which
was
dominated
by
the
provinces
of
the
Southeast
and
Northeast
.


It
is
estimated
that
from
30
to
40
%
of
the
population
of
Grão-Pará
,
estimated
at
100,000
people
,
died
.


In
1833
the
Province
had
119,877
inhabitants
,
being
32,751
Amerindians
and
29,977
black
slaves
.


Mixed-race
people
were
42,000
.


The
White
minority
was
15,000
,
over
half
of
them
Portuguese
.


The
revolt
had
a
strong
racial
background
.


The
Amerindian
,
Black
and
mixed
majority
,
which
lived
under
deep
poverty
,
fought
against
the
White
minority
that
dominated
the
economy
and
culture
,
not
only
in
Grão-Pará
,
but
in
the
rest
of
Brazil

The
Fall
of
Kabul
took
place
in
2001
during
the
War
in
Afghanistan
.


Northern
Alliance
forces
began
their
attack
on
the
city
on
November
13
and
made
swift
progress
against
Taliban
forces
that
were
heavily
weakened
by
American
and
British
air
strikes
.


The
advance
moved
ahead
of
plans
,
and
the
next
day
the
Northern
Alliance
forces
(
supported
by
ODA
555
)
entered
Kabul
and
met
no
resistance
inside
the
city
.


Taliban
forces
retreated
to
Kandahar
in
the
south
.


Coupled
with
the
fall
of
Mazar-i-Sharif
five
days
earlier
,
the
capture
of
Kabul
was
a
significant
blow
to
Taliban
control
of
Afghanistan
.


As
a
result
of
all
the
losses
,
surviving
members
of
the
Taliban
and
al-Qaeda
retreated
toward
Kandahar
,
the
spiritual
birthplace
and
home
of
the
Taliban
movement
,
and
Tora
Bora
.


Cyclone
Ivan
was
a
powerful
tropical
cyclone
that
struck
Madagascar
in
February
2008
.


Forming
from
a
persistent
area
of
convection
on
February
7
,
Ivan
initially
tracked
southeastward
,
before
looping
to
the
west-southwest
.


Encountering
favourable
conditions
,
it
strengthened
to
attain
peak
winds
on
February
17
before
striking
northeastern
Madagascar
.


It
degenerated
into
a
remnant
low
pressure
area
as
it
crossed
the
island
,
and
briefly
re-organized
into
a
weak
tropical
depression
before
dissipating
on
February
22
.


Ivan
caused
heavy
damage
in
Madagascar
,
leaving
severe
flooding
and
wind
damage
.


In
Île
Sainte-Marie
,
the
worst
hit
area
,
90
%
of
the
infrastructure
was
destroyed
,
and
70
%
of
the
structures
were
destroyed
.


On
mainland
Madagascar
,
over
of
cultivated
crops
were
destroyed
,
leaving
hundreds
of
families
without
food
.


In
addition
,
severe
flooding
and
high
winds
in
Toamasina
left
the
entire
city
without
electricity
or
drinkable
water
.


In
all
,
over
330,000
people
were
left
homeless
,
and
the
storm
caused
93
deaths
.


The
Cuban
Revolution
(
)
was
an
armed
revolt
conducted
by
Fidel
Castro
's
revolutionary
26th
of
July
Movement
and
its
allies
against
the
military
dictatorship
of
Cuban
President
Fulgencio
Batista
.


The
revolution
began
in
July
1953
,
and
continued
sporadically
until
the
rebels
finally
ousted
Batista
on
31
December
1958
,
replacing
his
government
with
a
revolutionary
socialist
state
.


26
july
1953
is
celebrated
in
cuba
as
the
``
day
of
the
revolution
''
.


the
26th
of
july
movement
later
reformed
along
communist
lines
,
becoming
the
communist
party
in
october
1965
.


the
cuban
revolution
had
powerful
domestic
and
international
repercussions
.


In
particular
,
it
transformed
Cuba
's
relationship
with
the
United
States
,
although
efforts
to
improve
diplomatic
relations
have
gained
momentum
in
recent
years
.


In
the
immediate
aftermath
of
the
revolution
,
Castro
's
government
began
a
program
of
nationalization
,
centralization
of
the
press
and
political
consolidation
that
transformed
Cuba
's
economy
and
civil
society
.


the
revolution
also
heralded
an
era
of
cuban
intervention
in
foreign
military
conflicts
,
including
the
angolan
civil
war
and
the
nicaraguan
revolution
.


Several
rebellions
occurred
the
six
years
after
1959
among
the
impoverished
peasantry
,
mainly
in
the
Escambray
mountains
,
which
were
repressed
by
the
Revolutionary
government
.


operation
winter
storm
(
)
,
a
german
offensive
in
december
1942
during
world
war
ii
,
involved
the
german
4th
panzer
army
failing
to
break
the
soviet
encirclement
of
the
german
6th
army
during
the
battle
of
stalingrad
.


In
late
November
1942
the
Red
Army
had
completed
Operation
Uranus
,
encircling
some
300,000
Axis
personnel
in
and
around
the
city
of
Stalingrad
.


german
forces
within
the
stalingrad
pocket
and
directly
outside
were
reorganized
(
22
november
1942
)
into
army
group
don
and
placed
under
the
command
of
field
marshal
erich
von
manstein
.


The
Red
Army
continued
to
allocate
as
many
resources
as
possible
to
the
planned
Operation
Saturn
to
isolate
Army
Group
A
from
the
rest
of
the
German
Army
.


To
remedy
the
situation
,
the
``
Luftwaffe
''
attempted
to
supply
German
forces
in
Stalingrad
through
an
air
bridge
.


When
the
``
Luftwaffe
''
failed
and
it
became
obvious
that
a
breakout
could
only
succeed
if
launched
as
early
as
possible
,
Manstein
decided
on
a
relief
effort
.


Originally
,
Manstein
was
promised
four
``
panzer
''
divisions
.


Due
to
German
reluctance
to
weaken
certain
sectors
by
redeploying
German
units
,
the
task
of
opening
a
corridor
to
the
enciricled
German
6th
Army
fell
to
the
4th
Panzer
Army
.


The
German
force
was
pitted
against
several
Soviet
armies
tasked
with
the
destruction
of
the
encircled
German
forces
and
their
offensive
around
the
lower
Chir
River
.


The
German
offensive
caught
the
Red
Army
by
surprise
and
made
large
gains
on
the
first
day
.


The
spearhead
forces
enjoyed
air
support
and
defeated
counterattacks
by
Soviet
troops
.


By
13
December
,
Soviet
resistance
had
slowed
the
German
advance
considerably
.


although
german
forces
took
the
area
surrounding
,
the
red
army
launched
operation
little
saturn
on
16
december
and
crushed
the
italian
8th
army
on
army
group
don
's
left
flank
,
threatening
the
survival
of
manstein
's
force
.


As
resistance
and
casualties
increased
,
Manstein
appealed
to
Hitler
and
to
the
commander
of
the
German
6th
Army
,
General
Friedrich
Paulus
,
to
allow
the
6th
Army
to
break
out
of
Stalingrad
;
both
refused
.


The
4th
Panzer
Army
continued
its
attempt
to
open
a
corridor
to
the
6th
Army
on
18–19
December
,
but
was
unable
to
do
so
without
the
aid
of
forces
inside
the
Stalingrad
pocket
.


Manstein
called
off
the
assault
on
23
December
and
by
Christmas
Eve
the
4th
Panzer
Army
began
to
withdraw
to
its
starting
position
.


Due
to
the
failure
of
the
6th
Army
to
break
out
from
the
Soviet
encirclement
,
the
Red
Army
could
continue
the
``
strangulation
''
of
German
forces
in
Stalingrad
.


Hurricane
Gordon
was
a
long-lived
and
catastrophic
late-season
hurricane
of
the
1994
Atlantic
hurricane
season
.


The
twelfth
and
final
tropical
cyclone
of
the
season
,
Gordon
formed
in
the
southwestern
Caribbean
on
November
8
.


Without
strengthening
,
the
storm
made
landfall
on
Nicaragua
.


later
on
november
10
,
the
storm
began
to
strengthen
as
it
tracked
further
from
land
,
and
it
quickly
strengthened
into
tropical
storm
gordon
,
the
seventh
named
storm
that
season
.


Gordon
also
made
landfalls
in
Jamaica
and
Cuba
while
a
minimal
tropical
storm
.


It
entered
the
southwestern
Atlantic
while
resembling
a
subtropical
cyclone
.


By
the
time
it
entered
the
Gulf
of
Mexico
,
the
storm
was
fully
tropical
again
.


tropical
storm
gordon
later
crossed
the
florida
keys
,
and
turning
to
the
northeast
it
made
landfall
in
fort
myers
,
florida
.


Gordon
strengthened
after
it
re-entered
the
Atlantic
Ocean
,
becoming
a
hurricane
on
November
17
.


It
briefly
threatened
North
Carolina
while
turning
to
the
northwest
,
although
it
turned
to
the
south
and
weakened
.


Gordon
deteriorated
into
a
tropical
depression
and
struck
Florida
again
at
that
intensity
on
November
20
.


It
turned
to
the
north
and
dissipated
the
next
day
over
South
Carolina
.


Gordon
first
caused
flooding
in
northern
Costa
Rica
that
destroyed
700
houses
and
caused
$
30
million
in
damage
.


There
were
six
deaths
in
the
country
and
an
additional
two
deaths
in
neighboring
Panama
.


upon
affecting
jamaica
,
the
storm
was
responsible
$
11.8
million
in
damage
and
four
deaths
.


Damage
was
heaviest
in
Haiti
,
after
a
prolonged
southwesterly
flow
dropped
of
rainfall
in
a
24‑hour
period
.


The
rains
resulted
in
extensive
mudslides
and
flooding
that
disrupted
transportation
and
damaged
10,800
houses
,
with
another
3,500
destroyed
.


There
were
1,122
deaths
in
the
country
,
partially
due
to
deforested
hills
,
and
damage
was
estimated
at
$
50
million
.


In
neighboring
Dominican
Republic
,
there
were
five
additional
deaths
,
as
well
as
flooding
near
its
capital
.


In
Cuba
,
Gordon
caused
$
100
million
in
damage
,
and
5,906
houses
were
damaged
or
destroyed
.


Due
to
large-scale
evacuations
,
there
were
only
two
deaths
in
the
country
.


In
Florida
,
the
storm
caused
$
400
million
in
damage
(
1994
USD
,
equivalent
to
about
$
million
in
)
,
much
of
it
agricultural
,
and
there
were
eleven
deaths
,
eight
of
them
direct
.


Gordon
later
affected
North
Carolina
with
high
waves
,
causing
beach
erosion
and
destroying
five
houses
.


Overall
damage
was
$
594
million
due
to
Gordon
(
1994
USD
,
equivalent
to
about
$
billion
in
)
.


International
governments
and
agencies
through
the
United
Nations
sent
relief
supplies
and
monetary
assistance
to
Haiti
,
following
Gordon
's
devastating
impact
there
.


American
soldiers
were
already
stationed
in
the
country
to
restore
ousted
Jean-Bertrand
Aristide
to
presidency
.


The
troops
helped
in
rescues
and
worked
to
restore
a
damaged
road
between
Port-au-Prince
and
Jacmel
.


Despite
the
deaths
and
damage
,
the
name
was
not
retired
following
the
season
.


Hurricane
Bob
was
one
of
the
costliest
hurricanes
in
New
England
history
.


the
second
named
storm
and
first
hurricane
of
the
1991
atlantic
hurricane
season
,
bob
developed
from
an
area
of
low
pressure
near
the
bahamas
on
august
16
.


the
depression
steadily
intensified
,
and
became
tropical
storm
bob
late
on
august
16
.


bob
curved
north-northwestward
as
a
tropical
storm
,
but
re-curved
to
the
north-northeast
after
becoming
a
hurricane
on
august
17
.


As
such
,
it
brushed
the
Outer
Banks
of
North
Carolina
on
August
18
and
August
19
,
and
subsequently
intensified
into
a
major
hurricane
(
Category
3
or
greater
on
the
Saffir-Simpson
Hurricane
Scale
)
.


After
peaking
in
intensity
with
maximum
sustained
winds
of
115
mph
(
185
km/h
)
,
Bob
weakened
slightly
as
it
approached
the
coast
of
New
England
.


some
sources
say
the
winds
of
bob
might
have
gone
as
high
as
125
mph
sustained
.


bob
made
landfall
twice
in
rhode
island
as
a
category
2
hurricane
on
august
19
,
first
on
block
island
and
then
in
newport
.


upon
doing
so
,
it
became
the
only
hurricane
to
make
landfall
in
the
contiguous
united
states
during
the
1991
season
.


Moving
further
inland
,
Bob
rapidly
weakened
,
and
deteriorated
to
a
tropical
storm
while
emerging
into
the
Gulf
of
Maine
.


shortly
thereafter
,
bob
made
landfall
in
maine
as
a
strong
tropical
storm
early
on
august
20
.


bob
entered
the
canadian
province
of
new
brunswick
a
few
hours
later
,
where
it
transitioned
into
an
extratropical
cyclone
.


by
august
21
,
the
remnants
of
bob
crossed
newfoundland
and
re-emerged
into
the
open
atlantic
ocean
.


The
remnants
traveled
a
long
distance
across
the
northern
Atlantic
Ocean
,
and
finally
dissipated
west
of
Portugal
on
August
29
.


Bob
left
extensive
damage
throughout
New
England
in
its
wake
,
totaling
approximately
$
1.5
billion
(
1991
USD
,
$
USD
)
.


This
made
it
one
of
the
costliest
United
States
hurricanes
at
the
time
;
as
of
2013
,
it
ranked
thirty-second
in
the
category
.


but
some
sources
say
that
bob
might
have
caused
as
much
as
$
3
billion
(
1991
usd
,
$
usd
)
in
damage
.


in
addition
,
eighteen
fatalities
were
reported
in
association
with
bob
.


The
loss
of
life
and
most
of
the
damage
occurred
as
a
result
of
high
winds
and
rough
seas
.


There
were
six
confirmed
tornadoes
during
its
passage
.


bob
is
the
most
recent
hurricane
to
hit
the
new
england
states
directly
as
a
hurricane
.


In
response
to
anti-protest
laws
in
Ukraine
(
announced
on
16
January
2014
and
enacted
on
21
January
2014
)
,
a
standoff
between
protesters
and
police
began
on
19
January
2014
that
was
precipitated
by
a
series
of
riots
in
central
Kiev
on
Hrushevsky
Street
,
outside
Dynamo
Stadium
and
adjacent
to
the
ongoing
Euromaidan
protests
.


During
a
Euromaidan
rally
which
gathered
up
to
200,000
protesters
,
participants
marched
on
the
Verkhovna
Rada
and
were
met
by
police
cordons
.


Following
a
tense
stand-off
,
violence
started
as
police
confronted
protesters
.


Protesters
erected
blockades
to
prevent
the
movement
of
government
forces
.


Four
protesters
were
confirmed
as
having
died
in
clashes
with
police
,
three
of
whom
were
shot
.


On
28
January
2014
,
9
of
the
12
anti-protest
laws
were
repealed
and
Prime
Minister
Mykola
Azarov
tendered
his
resignation
and
a
bill
offering
amnesty
to
arrested
and
charged
protesters
was
issued
.


On
14
February
2014
,
groups
responsible
for
organizing
the
standoff
agreed
to
partially
unblock
the
street
to
restore
traffic
,
but
maintain
the
barricades
and
ongoing
protests
.


Following
the
amnesty
of
protesters
on
16
February
2014
,
police
and
protesters
mutually
receded
while
allowing
a
corridor
for
traffic
.


This
lasted
until
18
February
2014
,
when
thousands
marched
on
parliament
once
again
,
reestablishing
Hrushevskoho
Street
and
related
streets
in
a
new
standoff
with
police
.


By
19
February
2014
,
all
barricades
had
been
cleared
from
the
streets
and
protesters
pushed
back
.


The
1966
Syrian
coup
d'état
refers
to
events
between
21
and
23
February
during
which
the
government
of
the
Syrian
Arab
Republic
was
overthrown
and
replaced
.


the
ruling
national
command
of
the
arab
socialist
ba'ath
party
were
removed
from
power
by
a
union
of
the
party
's
military
committee
and
the
regional
command
,
under
the
leadership
of
salah
jadid
.


The
coup
was
precipitated
by
a
heightening
in
the
power
struggle
between
the
party
's
old
guard
,
represented
by
Michel
Aflaq
,
Salah
al-Din
al-Bitar
,
and
Munif
al-Razzaz
,
and
the
younger
factions
adhering
to
a
Neo-Ba'athist
position
.


On
21
February
,
supporters
of
the
old
guard
in
the
army
ordered
the
transfer
of
their
rivals
.


Two
days
later
,
the
Military
Committee
,
backing
the
younger
factions
,
launched
a
coup
that
involved
violent
fighting
in
Aleppo
,
Damascus
,
Deir
ez-Zor
,
and
Latakia
.


As
a
result
of
the
coup
,
the
party
's
historical
founders
fled
the
country
and
spent
the
rest
of
their
lives
in
exile
.


Jadid
's
government
was
the
most
radical
administration
in
Syria
's
history
.


the
coup
created
a
permanent
schism
between
the
syrian
and
iraqi
regional
branches
of
the
ba'ath
party
and
their
respective
national
commands
,
with
many
senior
syrian
ba'athists
defecting
to
iraq
.


As
a
legacy
of
the
coup
,
during
Jadid
's
rule
,
Syria
initiated
a
propaganda
campaign
against
the
Iraqi
Ba'athists
.


Jadid
's
government
would
be
overthrown
in
the
Corrective
Movement
of
1970
,
which
brought
Hafez
al-Assad
to
power
.


The
1933
Chesapeake–Potomac
hurricane
was
among
the
most
damaging
hurricanes
in
the
Mid-Atlantic

in
the
eastern
United
States
.


The
sixth
storm
and
third
hurricane
of
the
very
active
1933
Atlantic
hurricane
season
,
it
formed
in
the
eastern
Atlantic
,
where
it
moved
west-northwestward
and
eventually
became
a
Category

New
England
allowed
a
continued
northwest
course
,
bringing
the
storm
south
of
Bermuda
and
later
toward
the
middle
coast
of
the
eastern
United
States
.


Advance
warning
allowed
hundreds
of
people
to
evacuate
ahead
of
the
hurricane
making
landfall
.


It
did
so
in
northeastern
North
Carolina
on
August
23
with
winds
of
about
90
mph
(
150
km/h
)
.


Soon
after
,
the
eye
crossed
over
Norfolk
,
Virginia
,
the
first
time
that
happened
since
1821
.


The
hurricane
weakened
into
a
tropical
storm
over
northern
Virginia
shortly
before
passing
near
Washington
,
D.C.
,
becoming
the
worst
tropical
cyclone
there
since
1896
.


Curving
northward
,
the
storm
moved
through
Pennsylvania
and
New
York
before
losing
tropical
characteristics
on
August
25
.


Now
extratropical
,
the
former
hurricane
moved
across
Atlantic
Canada
,
dissipating
on
August
28
.


Across
the
eastern
United
States
,
the
hurricane
left
widespread
damage
amounting
to
over
$
40
million
(
equivalent
to
about
$
billion
in
)
and
causing
at
least
47
deaths
.


although
the
storm
struck
north
carolina
,
damage
in
the
state
totaled
only
about
$
250,000
,
largely
to
crops
and
transport
.


Along
the
Chesapeake
Bay
,
the
storm
produced
100-year
flooding
from
its
storm
surge
,
setting
records
that
remained
for
over
80
years
.


In
Virginia
,
flooding
covered
downtown
portions
of
Norfolk
in
the
southeast
and
Alexandria
in
the
north
.


Damage
in
the
state
was
estimated
at
$
17.5
million
.


Similarly
heavy
damage
occurred
in
Maryland
,
including
over
$
7
million
to
crops
.


High
waves
along
the
coast
eroded
beaches
and
created
a
new
inlet
at
Ocean
City
.


The
highest
rainfall
associated
with
the
hurricane
was
at
York
,
Pennsylvania
.


In
the
state
,
the
rains
flooded
several
rivers
which
forced
thousands
to
evacuate
.


In
neighboring
New
Jersey
,
high
waves
wrecked
boats
and
destroyed
a
fishing
pier
,
while
in
New
York
,
flooding
caused
traffic
jams
.


In
Atlantic
Canada
,
heavy
rainfall
assisted
firefighters
in
combating
wildfires
,
and
the
associated
winds
caused
isolated
power
outages
.


in
may
2003
,
a
tropical
cyclone
officially
called
``
very
severe
cyclonic
storm
bob
01
''
produced
the
worst
flooding
in
sri
lanka
in
56
years
.


The
first
storm
of
the
2003
North
Indian
Ocean
cyclone
season
,
it
developed
over
the
Bay
of
Bengal
on
May
10
.


Favorable
environmental
conditions
allowed
the
system
to
intensify
steadily
while
moving
northwestward
.


The
storm
reached
peak
maximum
sustained
winds
of
140
km/h
(
85
mph
)
on
May
13
,
making
it
a
very
severe
cyclonic
storm
according
to
the
India
Meteorological
Department
(
IMD
)
,
which
is
the
official
Regional
Specialized
Meteorological
Center
for
the
basin
.


The
cyclone
drifted
north
over
the
central
Bay
of
Bengal
,
gradually
weakening
due
to
heightened
wind
shear
.


Turning
eastward
,
the
storm
deteriorated
to
a
deep
depression
on
May
16
before
it
curved
northeastward
and
re-intensified
into
a
cyclonic
storm
.


It
came
ashore
in
western
Myanmar
and
dissipated
over
land
the
following
day
.


In
the
wake
of
prolonged
precipitation
during
the
first
half
of
May
,
the
cyclone
produced
torrential
rains
across
southwest
Sri
Lanka
while
stationary
in
the
central
Bay
of
Bengal
.


The
storm
drew
extensive
moisture
that
coalesced
in
the
mountainous
portion
of
the
island
.


A
station
at
Ratnapura
recorded
of
rainfall
in
18
hours
on
May
17
,
including
in
one
hour
.


In
southwestern
Sri
Lanka
,
the
rainfall
caused
flooding
and
landslides
that
destroyed
24,750
homes
and
damaged
32,426
others
,
displacing
about
800,000
people
.


Overall
damage
totaled
about
$
135
million
(
2003
USD
)
,
and
there
were
260
deaths
.


The
cyclone
also
produced
some
rainfall
in
the
Andaman
and
Nicobar
Islands
of
India
and
along
the
country
's
eastern
coast
.


The
storm
funneled
moisture
away
from
the
mainland
,
which
possibly
contributed
to
a
heat
wave
that
killed
1,900
people
,
and
dropped
heavy
rainfall
in
Myanmar
.


The
Blizzard
of
1966
swept
across
most
of
the
United
States
and
Canada
east
of
the
Rocky
Mountains
on
January
29
,
1966
,
and
brought
record
low
temperatures
,
high
winds
and
heavy
snowfall
in
its
wake
.


Within
days
,
at
least
142
people
had
been
killed
—
31
had
frozen
to
death
,
46
died
in
fires
that
started
while
people
were
trying
to
heat
their
home
.


Others
died
from
heart
attacks
while
shoveling
snow
or
pushing
cars
,
or
traffic
accidents
caused
by
slick
roads
.


The
death
toll
reached
201
by
Wednesday
,
February
2
,
as
the
storm
eased
.


On
Monday
,
January
31
,
federal
government
employees
in
Washington
were
excused
from
reporting
to
work
and
international
airports
were
closed
from
Boston
to
Washington
,
D.C..
or
of
snow
fell
on
Oswego
,
New
York
,
and
the
additional
accumulation
raised
the
snow
level
to
in
Norfolk
,
Virginia
.


By
February
1
,
additional
snow
brought
the
level
to
or
to
Oswego
.


(
This
held
the
record
for
the
most
snowfall
in
a
single
storm
in
Oswego
until
the
Lake
Effect
snow
storm
of
February
2007
)
.


The
storm
began
as
a
nor'easter
,
which
affected
the
New
York
City
metro
area
and
was
followed
by
heavy
``
wraparound
''
lake
effect
snows
.


Winds
were
more
than
during
the
storm
,
and
at
Fair
Haven
,
New
York
they
are
believed
to
have
exceeded
.


The
snow
was
badly
drifted
and
roads
and
schools
closed
as
long
as
a
week
.


Drifts
covered
entire
2
story
houses
.


A
total
of
of
snow
was
recorded
at
Oswego
,
of
this
falling
on
the
last
day
of
the
storm
alone
.


of
snow
were
also
recorded
at
Camden
,
New
York
on
the
same
day
.


The
last
day
of
the
blizzard
the
winds
subsided
and
snowburst
conditions
prevailed
,
with
the
snow
falling
straight
down
.


Fair
Haven
did
not
have
official
snowfall
records
at
the
time
,
but
state
troopers
reported
measuring
of
snow
on
the
level
,
where
none
had
been
prior
to
the
storm
.


Syracuse
,
New
York
received
a
record
snowfall
of
which
remained
their
heaviest
storm
on
record
,
until
the
Blizzard
of
1993
.


The
storm
lasted
from
January
27
to
January
31
,
1966
,
a
total
of
4½
days
.


The
daily
snowfall
totals
for
Oswego
are
as
follows
.


On
January
22–23
of
1966
,
the
city
of
Batavia
and
Genesee
County
had
of
snow
fall
on
that
Saturday
night
alone
.


The
only
thing
that
prevented
that
snowstorm
from
becoming
a
true
blizzard
like
this
infamous
one
of
the
very
next
weekend
was
the
lack
of
high
winds
.


The
Caroline
War
was
the
second
phase
of
the
Hundred
Years
'
War
between
France
and
England
,
following
the
Edwardian
War
.


it
was
so-named
after
charles
v
of
france
,
who
resumed
the
war
nine
years
after
the
treaty
of
UNK
(
signed
1360
)
.


The
Kingdom
of
France
dominated
this
phase
of
the
war
.


The
Black
Prince
,
eldest
son
and
heir
of
Edward
III
of
England
,
spent
a
huge
sum
of
money
in
order
to
restore
Peter
the
Cruel
to
the
throne
of
Castile
.


The
Castilian
King
was
unable
to
repay
him
,
however
,
so
the
Black
Prince
raised
the
taxes
in
his
domains
in
Aquitaine
.


The
people
's
complaints
were
unheeded
,
so
they
appealed
to
the
French
King
Charles
V.
In
May
1369
,
the
Black
Prince
received
summons
from
the
French
king
demanding
his
presence
in
Paris
.


The
prince
refused
,
and
Charles
responded
by
declaring
war
.


He
immediately
set
out
to
reverse
the
territorial
losses
imposed
at
Brétigny
and
he
was
largely
successful
in
his
lifetime
.


His
successor
,
Charles
VI
,
made
peace
with
the
son
of
the
Black
Prince
,
Richard
II
,
in
1389
.


This
truce
was
extended
many
times
until
the
war
was
resumed
in
1415
.


The
War
of
the
Succession
of
Landshut
resulted
from
a
dispute
between
the
duchies
of
Bavaria-Munich
(
``
Bayern-München
''
in
German
)
and
Bavaria-Landshut
(
``
Bayern-Landshut
''
)
.


an
earlier
agreement
between
the
different
wittelsbach
lines
,
the
treaty
of
pavia
(
1329
)
,
concerned
the
law
of
succession
and
stated
that
if
one
branch
should
become
extinct
in
the
male
line
then
the
other
would
inherit
.


This
agreement
disregarded
imperial
law
,
which
stipulated
that
the
Holy
Roman
Emperor
should
inherit
should
a
line
fail
.


George
,
Duke
of
Bavaria-Landshut
and
his
wife
Hedwig
Jagiellon
failed
to
produce
a
male
heir
,
so
George
-
in
a
breach
of
both
,
imperial
law
at
the
one
hand
,
the
house
treaty
at
the
other
-
named
his
daughter
Elisabeth
as
his
heir
.


Because
of
the
agreement
,
Duke
Albert
of
the
Munich
line
did
not
accept
this
,
leading
to
war
in
1503
.


over
the
course
of
this
two-year
war
,
many
villages
surrounding
landshut
were
reduced
to
ashes
,
such
as
unk
.


The
war
ended
in
1505
with
the
death
of
Elisabeth
and
her
husband
Ruprecht
,
Count
Palatine
of
the
Rhine
,
and
a
decision
through
arbitration
by
Emperor
Maximilian
I
on
30
July
1505
at
the
Diet
of
Cologne
.


The
two
grandsons
of
George
,
Otto
Henry
(
``
Otto-Heinrich
''
)
and
Philip
,
retained
Palatinate-Neuburg
(
``
Junge
Pfalz
''
)
,
a
fragmented
region
from
the
upper
Danube
over
Franconia
to
the
northern
part
of
the
Upper
Palatinate
.


Neuburg
an
der
Donau
was
chosen
as
the
capital
of
the
new
state
.


Because
the
two
heirs
had
not
yet
reached
their
majority
,
Frederick
II
,
Count
Palatine
of
the
Rhine
,
served
as
regent
in
a
caretaker
regime
.


the
rest
of
the
territory
went
to
the
munich
line
of
the
house
of
wittelsbach
.


The
emperor
took
the
territory
around
Kufstein
for
himself
as
reward
for
his
mediation
;
the
Imperial
City
of
Nuremberg
gained
important
territories
to
the
east
of
the
city
,
including
the
authorities
of
Lauf
,
Hersbruck
,
and
Altdorf
.


As
Count
Palatine
,
Otto-Heinrich
spent
huge
sums
of
money
to
build
a
palace
at
Neuburg
an
der
Donau
.


through
inheritance
,
he
later
became
elector
palatine
,
where
his
additions
``

''
to
heidelberg
castle
made
him
one
of
the
most
important
builders
of
the
german
renaissance
.


The
Battle
of
San
Patricio
was
fought
on
February
27
,
1836
,
between
Mexican
troops
and
rebellious
immigrants
from
the
Mexican
province
of
Texas
,
known
as
Texians
.


The
battle
marked
the
start
of
the
Goliad
Campaign
,
the
Mexican
offensive
to
retake
the
Texas
Gulf
Coast
.


It
took
place
in
and
around
San
Patricio
.


By
the
end
of
1835
,
all
Mexican
troops
had
been
driven
from
Texas
.


Frank
W.
Johnson
,
the
commander
of
the
volunteer
army
in
Texas
,
and
James
Grant
gathered
volunteers
for
a
planned
invasion
of
the
Mexican
port
town
of
Matamoros
.


After
spending
several
weeks
gathering
horses
for
the
Matamoros
Expedition
,
in
late
February
,
Johnson
and
about
40
men
led
the
herd
to
San
Patricio
.


Johnson
assigned
some
of
his
troops
to
a
ranch
outside
town
to
guard
the
horses
,
while
the
rest
of
his
men
garrisoned
in
three
different
locations
in
town
.


Unbeknownst
to
the
Texians
,
on
February
18
Mexican
General
José
de
Urrea
had
led
a
large
contingent
of
troops
from
Matamoros
into
Texas
.


Their
goal
was
to
neutralize
the
Texian
soldiers
gathered
along
the
coast
.


Urrea
's
men
easily
followed
the
trail
left
by
Johnson
's
herd
of
horses
.


Mexican
soldiers
surprised
the
sleeping
Texians
in
San
Patricio
in
the
early
hours
of
February
27
.


After
a
fifteen-minute
battle
,
all
but
six
Texians
had
been
killed
or
imprisoned
.


One
Mexican
soldier
was
killed
and
four
injured
.


operation
tonga
was
the
codename
given
to
the
airborne
operation
undertaken
by
the
british
6th
airborne
division
between
5
june
and
7
june
1944
as
a
part
of
operation
overlord
and
the
d-day
landings
during
world
war
ii
.


The
paratroopers
and
glider-borne
airborne
troops
of
the
division
,
commanded
by
Major-General
Richard
Nelson
Gale
,
landed
on
the
eastern
flank
of
the
invasion
area
,
near
to
the
city
of
Caen
,
tasked
with
a
number
of
objectives
.


The
division
was
to
capture
two
strategically
important
bridges
over
the
Caen
Canal
and
Orne
River
which
were
to
be
used
by
Allied
ground
forces
to
advance
once
the
seaborne
landings
had
taken
place
,
destroy
several
other
bridges
to
deny
their
use
to
the
Germans
and
secure
several
important
villages
.


The
division
was
also
assigned
the
task
of
assaulting
and
destroying
the
Merville
Gun
Battery
,
an
artillery
battery
that
Allied
intelligence
believed
housed
a
number
of
heavy
artillery
pieces
,
which
could
bombard
the
nearest
invasion
beach
(
codenamed
Sword
)
and
possibly
inflict
heavy
casualties
on
the
Allied
troops
landing
on
it
.


Having
achieved
these
objectives
,
the
division
was
then
to
create
and
secure
a
bridgehead
focused
around
the
captured
bridges
until
they
linked
up
with
advancing
Allied
ground
forces
.


The
division
suffered
from
a
combination
of
bad
weather
and
poor
pilot
navigation
,
which
caused
many
of
the
airborne
troops
to
be
dropped
inaccurately
throughout
the
divisional
operational
area
causing
a
number
of
casualties
and
making
conducting
operations
much
more
difficult
.


In
particular
,
the
9th
Parachute
Battalion
,
which
was
assigned
the
task
of
destroying
the
Merville
artillery
battery
,
was
only
able
to
gather
up
a
fraction
of
its
strength
before
it
had
to
attack
the
battery
,
with
the
result
that
the
depleted
force
suffered
heavy
casualties
.


However
,
the
battery
was
successfully
assaulted
and
the
guns
inside
it
disabled
.


The
division
's
other
objectives
were
also
achieved
despite
the
problems
encountered
.


A
small
force
of
glider-borne
troops
,
from
the
2nd
Battalion
Oxfordshire
and
Buckinghamshire
Light
Infantry
,
secured
two
bridges
over
the
Caen
Canal
and
River
Orne
in
a
coup-de-main
operation
.


The
other
bridges
were
destroyed
by
the
division
,
and
a
number
of
villages
were
occupied
.


A
bridgehead
was
formed
by
the
division
,
and
it
successfully
repulsed
a
number
of
German
counter-attacks
until
Allied
ground
forces
from
the
invasion
beaches
reached
its
positions
.


The
actions
of
the
division
severely
limited
the
ability
of
the
German
defenders
to
communicate
and
organise
themselves
,
ensuring
that
the
seaborne
troops
could
not
be
attacked
during
the
vital
first
few
hours
after
landing
when
they
were
most
vulnerable
.


The
Bishopsgate
bombing
occurred
on
24
April
1993
,
when
the
Provisional
Irish
Republican
Army
(
IRA
)
detonated
a
powerful
truck
bomb
on
Bishopsgate
,
a
major
thoroughfare
in
London
's
financial
district
,
the
City
of
London
.


Telephoned
warnings
were
sent
about
an
hour
beforehand
,
but
a
news
photographer
was
killed
in
the
blast
and
44
people
were
injured
,
with
fatalities
minimised
due
to
it
occurring
on
a
Saturday
.


The
blast
destroyed
the
nearby
St
Ethelburga
's
church
and
wrecked
Liverpool
Street
station
and
the
NatWest
Tower
.


The
financial
cost
was
severe
,
estimated
at
the
time
to
be
over
£1
billion
of
damage
(
about
£
in
)
,
making
it
the
costliest
terrorist
attack
at
the
time
(
since
surpassed
by
the
September
11
attacks
)
.


As
a
result
of
the
bombing
,
which
happened
just
over
a
year
after
the
bombing
of
the
nearby
Baltic
Exchange
,
a
``
ring
of
steel
''
was
implemented
to
protect
the
City
,
and
many
firms
introduced
disaster
recovery
plans
in
case
of
further
attacks
or
similar
disasters
.


£350
million
was
spent
on
repairing
damage
.


In
1994
detectives
believed
they
knew
the
identities
of
the

but
lacked
sufficient
evidence
to
arrest
them
.


The
Danture
campaign
comprised
a
series
of
encounters
between
the
Portuguese
and
the
Kingdom
of
Kandy
in
1594
,
part
of
the
Sinhalese–Portuguese
War
.


It
is
considered
a
turning
point
in
the
indigenous
resistance
to
Portuguese
expansion
.


For
the
first
time
in
Sri
Lanka
a
Portuguese
army
was
essentially
annihilated
,
when
they
were
on
the
verge
of
the
total
conquest
of
the
island
.


A
20,000-strong
Portuguese
army
,
led
by
Governor
Pedro
Lopes
de
Sousa
,
invaded
Kandy
on
5
July
1594
.


After
three
months
,
severely
depleted
by
guerilla
warfare
and
mass
desertions
,
what
remained
of
the
Portuguese
army
was
annihilated
at
Danture
by
the
Kandyans
under
King
Vimaladharmasuriya
.


With
this
victory
,
the
Kingdom
of
Kandy
emerged
as
a
major
military
power
;
it
was
to
retain
its
independence
,
against
Portuguese
,
Dutch
,
and
British
armies
,
until
1815
.


Victory
at
Danture
notwithstanding
,
only
the
mobile
section
of
the
Portuguese
army
in
Ceylon
was
annihilated
,
while
their
strongholds
remained
intact
,
and
so
Kandy
was
unable
to
follow
up
with
an
advance
into
the
lowlands
.


The
Portuguese
would
in
the
future
renew
their
offensive
against
Kandy
under
the
reorganized
forces
of
captain-general
Dom
Jerónimo
de
Azevedo
,
devastating
Kandy
in
the
process
.


the
cambodian
civil
war
(
)
was
a
civil
war
in
cambodia
fought
between
the
forces
of
the
communist
party
of
kampuchea
(
known
as
the
khmer
rouge
)
(
supported
by
north
vietnam
and
the
viet
cong
)
against
the
government
forces
of
the
kingdom
of
cambodia
and
,
after
october
1970
,
the
khmer
republic
,
which
had
succeeded
the
kingdom
(
both
supported
by
the
united
states
(
u.s.
)
and
south
vietnam
)
.


The
struggle
was
complicated
by
the
influence
and
actions
of
the
allies
of
the
two
warring
sides
.


North
Vietnam
's
People
's
Army
of
Vietnam
(
PAVN
)
involvement
was
designed
to
protect
its
Base
Areas
and
sanctuaries
in
eastern
Cambodia
,
without
which
the
prosecution
of
its
military
effort
in
South
Vietnam
would
have
been
more
difficult
.


Their
presence
was
at
first
tolerated
by
Prince
Sihanouk
,
the
Cambodian
head
of
state
,
but
domestic
resistance
combined
with
China
and
North
Vietnam
continuing
to
provide
aid
to
the
anti-government
Khmer
Rouge
alarmed
Sihanouk
and
caused
him
to
go
to
Moscow
to
request
the
Soviets
rein
in
the
behavior
of
North
Vietnam
.


the
deposition
of
sihanouk
by
the
cambodian
national
assembly
in
march
1970
,
following
wide
scale
protests
in
the
capital
against
the
presence
of
pavn
troops
in
the
country
,
put
a
pro-american
government
in
power
(
later
declared
the
khmer
republic
)
which
demanded
that
the
pavn
leave
cambodia
.


The
PAVN
refused
and
,
at
the
request
of
the
Khmer
Rouge
,
promptly
invaded
Cambodia
in
force
.


Between
March
and
June
1970
,
the
North
Vietnamese
captured
most
of
the
northeastern
third
of
the
country
in
engagements
with
the
Cambodian
army
.


The
North
Vietnamese
turned
over
some
of
their
conquests
and
provided
other
assistance
to
the
Khmer
Rouge
,
thus
empowering
what
was
at
the
time
a
small
guerrilla
movement
.


The
Cambodian
government
hastened
to
expand
its
army
to
combat
the
North
Vietnamese
and
the
growing
power
of
the
Khmer
Rouge
.


The
U.S.
was
motivated
by
the
desire
to
buy
time
for
its
withdrawal
from
Southeast
Asia
,
to
protect
its
ally
in
South
Vietnam
,
and
to
prevent
the
spread
of
communism
to
Cambodia
.


American
and
both
South
and
North
Vietnamese
forces
directly
participated
(
at
one
time
or
another
)
in
the
fighting
.


The
U.S.
assisted
the
central
government
with
massive
U.S.
aerial
bombing
campaigns
and
direct
material
and
financial
aid
,
while
the
North
Vietnamese
kept
soldiers
on
the
lands
that
they
had
previously
occupied
and
occasionally
engaged
the
Khmer
Republic
army
in
ground
combat
.


After
five
years
of
savage
fighting
,
the
Republican
government
was
defeated
on
17
April
1975
when
the
victorious
Khmer
Rouge
proclaimed
the
establishment
of
Democratic
Kampuchea
.


The
war
caused
a
refugee
crisis
in
Cambodia
with
two
million
people—more
than
25
percent
of
the
population—displaced
from
rural
areas
into
the
cities
,
especially
Phnom
Penh
which
grew
from
about
600,000
in
1970
to
an
estimated
population
of
nearly
2
million
by
1975
.


Children
were
widely
used
during
and
after
the
war
,
often
being
persuaded
or
forced
to
commit
atrocities
.


The
Cambodian
government
estimated
that
more
than
20
percent
of
the
property
in
the
country
had
been
destroyed
during
the
war
.


In
total
,
an
estimated
275,000–310,000
people
were
killed
as
a
result
of
the
war
.


The
conflict
was
part
of
the
Second
Indochina
War
(
1955–1975
)
which
also
consumed
the
neighboring
Kingdom
of
Laos
,
South
Vietnam
,
and
North
Vietnam
individually
referred
to
as
the
Laotian
Civil
War
and
the
Vietnam
War
respectively
.


The
Cambodian
civil
war
led
to
the
Cambodian
genocide
,
one
of
the
bloodiest
in
history
.


The
Siege
of
Toruń
was
one
of
the
battles
during
the
Swedish
invasion
of
Polish-Lithuanian
Commonwealth
(
Second
Northern
War
/
Deluge
)
.


It
started
on
2
July
1658
and
ended
on
30
December
1658
.


Swedish
garrison
capitulated
and
Toruń
returned
to
Polish
hands
.


In
mid-
September
1657
,
after
the
Siege
of
Krakow
(
1657
)
,
the
Holy
Roman
Empire
army
of
15,000
,
allied
to
the
Polish-Lithuanian
Commonwealth
,
marched
northwards
.


In
late
September
,
the
Austrians
concentrated
near
Plock
.


Polish
King
Jan
Kazimierz
wanted
to
use
them
to
capture
the
fortified
city
of
Toruń
,
but
Austrian
preparations
for
the
siege
were
very
slow
and
not
completed
before
winter
.


Due
to
weather
conditions
,
all
military
activities
were
postponed
until
spring
1658
,
and
the
Austrians
spent
the
winter
in
Greater
Poland
.


Polish
plans
for
1658
were
concentrated
on
gradual
recapture
of
the
province
of
Royal
Prussia
.


First
objective
was
Toruń
,
a
strategically
located
Vistula
river
port
,
with
modern
fortifications
.


Due
to
Dano-Swedish
War
,
most
Austrians
,
under
Field
Marshal
Raimondo
Montecuccoli
,
left
Poland
and
marched
to
Jutland
.


On
July
2
,
1658
,
Austrian
division
of
4,000
,
under
General
Jean-Louis
Raduit
de
Souches
began
the
siege
of
Toruń
.


The
Austrians
were
reinforced
by
Polish
infantry
,
while
the
city
was
defended
by
a
Swedish
garrison
of
2,400
,
commanded
by
General
Barthold
Hartwig
von
Bulow
.


Swedes
were
supported
by
German-speaking
,
Protestant
residents
of
Toruń
.


In
the
first
weeks
,
Austrian
and
Polish
commandants
limited
their
activities
to
blocking
the
city
.


On
July
26
,
artillery
barrage
initiated
an
assault
,
which
resulted
in
capture
of
several
Swedish
strongpoints
.


On
August
1
,
Krzysztof
Grodzicki
arrived
with
3,000
infantry
.


Soon
afterwards
,
Jan
Fryderyk
Sapieha
brought
1,000
soldiers
,
also
the
division
of
Stefan
Czarniecki
(
4,000
cavalry
)
joined
the
Polish
-
Austrian
forces
.


Furthermore
,
Brandenburg-Prussia
division
under
Boguslaw
Radziwill
,
which
had
switched
alliances
,
cooperated
with
Poles
.


The
division
of
Czarniecki
remained
near
Toruń
until
early
September
,
when
it
left
Poland
,
marching
towards
Denmark
.


On
October
12
,
Czarniecki
and
his
soldiers
reached
Hamburg
.


In
September
1658
,
Polish-Austrian
forces
were
reinforced
with
a
division
of
Jerzy
Lubomirski
,
and
on
September
23
,
Queen
Marie
Louise
Gonzaga
arrived
to
Torun
,
together
with
her
court
.


By
that
time
,
the
Polish
army
stationed
near
the
city
had
almost
19,000
soldiers
,
while
Austrian
forces
numbered
4,600
,
with
40
cannons
.


Main
assault
took
place
in
the
night
of
November
16/17
,
when
Polish-Austrian
soldiers
captured
three
bastions
,
losing
1,000
men
.


The
Swedish
garrison
finally
capitulated
on
December
30
.


During
the
siege
,
the
Swedes
lost
1,200
men
,
while
Poles
and
Austrians
lost
1,800
soldiers
,
including
1,500
Poles
.


The
Action
between
the
USS
``
Boston
''
and
``
Berceau
''
,
was
a
single
ship
action
off
Guadeloupe
,
during
the
Quasi-War
with
France
.


(
32
guns
)
,
Capt

George
Little
,
captured
the
French
corvette
,
``
capitaine
de
frégate
''
Louis-Andre
Senez
.


Cruising
600
miles
northeast
of
Guadeloupe
in
the
morning
of
12
October
,
``
Boston
''
,
spotted
two
vessels
that
by
8:00
A.M.
were
determined
to
be
warships
,
a
schooner
(
not
identified
)
and
the
24-gun
``
Berceau
''
,
which
then
headed
in
different
directions
.


Pursuing
the
latter
,
``
Boston
''
gained
steadily
before
catching
her
in
the
late
afternoon
(
the
American
report
gives
the
time
as
4:30
P.M.
,
French
3:30
P.M.
)
.


``
Berceau
''
then
shortened
sail
and
the
two
began
a
stubborn
engagement
,
each
trying
to
wreck
the
spars
,
sails
and
rigging
of
the
other
until
the
damage
to
the
tops
of
both
made
them
unmanageable
and
they
drifted
apart
.


The
crews
then
spent
the
next
several
hours
repairing
their
damage
so
that
they
could
rejoin
the
fight
.


Well
after
dusk
,
the
two
were
again
able
to
engage
(
the
French
report
gives
an
additional
intermediate
engagement
)
,
which
they
did
for
more
than
an
hour
.


The
action
was
finally
terminated
(
American
,
10:20
P.M.
;
French
11:30
P.M.
)
when
,
losing
her
fore
and
main
mast
and
already
having
had
boarding
attempts
repulsed
,
``
Berceau
''
was
forced
to
strike
her
colors
.


Following
several
days
spent
immobile
,
repairing
spars
,
sails
and
rigging
,
``
Boston
''
towed
``
Berceau
''
under
prize-master
Robert
Haswell
to
its
namesake
home
port
of
Boston
.


On
arrival
,
it
was
discovered
that
the
action
had
actually
been
fought
two
weeks
after
a
peace
agreement
had
formally
ended
hostilities
.


As
a
consequence
``
Berceau
''
was
repaired
at
American
expense
and
returned
to
France
.


The
victory
was
also
tainted
by
charges
that
the
French
officers
had
been
plundered
of
their
personal
belongings
and
negro
servants
,
with
the
active
participation
of
most
of
their
American
counterparts
.


Acquitted
in
a
resulting
court
martial
proceeding
,
most
of
``
Boston
''
s
officers
were
nonetheless
dismissed
from
the
Navy
.


The
Milford
Flat
Fire
was
the
largest
wildfire
in
Utah
history
.


It
was
started
by
lightning
on
Friday
,
July
6
,
2007
at
3:45
pm
near
Milford
,
Utah
.


The
fire
burned
363,052
acres
(
567
square
miles
)
and
caused
large
stretches
of
I-15
to
be
temporarily
closed
.


Many
veteran
firefighters
had
stated
this
was
the
fastest-moving
fire
they
had
ever
seen
.


On
Saturday
,
July
7
,
smoke
caused
numerous
wrecks
on
I-15
,
including
a
5-car
pile-up
,
and
a
fatal
hit-and-run
that
killed
2
motorcyclists
from
California
.


The
fire
also
caused
10
truckers
to
abandon
their
cargo
trailers
on
the
side
of
the
road
.


A
stretch
of
I-15
was
later
closed
.


The
fire
crossed
the
freeway
around
Cove
Fort
that
afternoon
,
causing
it
to
be
evacuated
.


The
fire
narrowly
missed
the
local
Chevron
gas
station
,
but
claimed
2
garage-like
structures
near
it
,
including
the
Dog
Valley
Trading
Post
,
as
well
as
a
crew
cab
pickup
truck
left
in
a
Park-and-Ride
lot
.


By
that
evening
the
fire
had
amassed
to

On
Sunday
,
July
8
,
the
fire
slowed
down
somewhat
,
reaching
the
mark
by
evening
.


The
freeway
was
reopened
,
but
later
a
stretch
was
closed
for
5
hours
.


Also
,
FEMA
announced
the
appropriation
of
federal
funds
to
help
fight
the
fire
.


Some
evacuated
residents
of
Cove
Fort
returned
to
view
the
damage
.


On
July
9
,
Firefighters
were
going
to
backburn
parts
of
I-15
,
but
the
winds
changed
,
and
the
plans
were
canceled
.


More
crews
arrived
,
bringing
the
total
personnel
from
200
to
about
300
firefighters
.


By
the
end
of
the
day
,
the
fire
had
grown
to

but
was
10

contained

On
July

The
Grangegorman
killings
were
the
homicide
on
6
March
1997
of
Sylvia
Shields
and
Mary
Callinan
,
patients
at
St
Brendan
's
Psychiatric
Hospital
in
Grangegorman
,
Dublin
,
Ireland
.


After
giving
a
false
confession
,
Dean
Lyons
was
charged
with
the
murders
and
placed
on
remand
.


In
his
statement
to
the
Garda
Síochána
(
police
)
,
Lyons
gave
details
that
would
only
be
known
to
the
murderer
or
to
the
investigators
.


After
Lyons
was
charged
,
Mark
Nash
confessed
to
the
killings
,
but
later
retracted
his
confession
.


In
April
2015
,
Nash
's
trial
for
the
murder
of
Shields
and
Callinan
began
after
an
unsuccessful
attempt
to
prevent
the
trial
from
going
forward
.


Lyons
was
described
by
one
of
the
gardaí
(
policemen
)
involved
in
the
case
as
a
``
Walter
Mitty
''
character
,
and
Charles
Smith
,
psychiatrist
and
director
of
the
Central
Mental
Hospital
,
Dundrum
,
felt
that
he
might
be
prone
to
exaggeration
and
attention
seeking
.


A
commission
of
investigation
was
set
up
to
investigate
the
conduct
of
the
Garda
in
the
case
.


Dean
Lyons
died
from
a
heroin
overdose
in
2000

He
spent
nine
months
in
jail
for
a
crime
that
he
did
not
commit

``
This
is

of
Narva
(

)
.
''


The
Narva
Offensive
(
15–28
February
1944
)
was
a
campaign
fought
between
the
German
army
detachment
``
Narwa
''
and
the
Soviet
Leningrad
Front
for
the
strategically
important
Narva
Isthmus
.


At
the
time
of
the
operation
,
Stalin
was
personally
interested
in
taking
Estonia
,
viewing
it
as
a
precondition
for
forcing
Finland
out
of
the
war

The
2nd
Shock
Army
expanded
the
bridgehead
in
the
Krivasoo
swamp
south
of
Narva
,
temporally
cutting
the
railway
behind
the
Sponheimer

Army
General
Leonid
Govorov
was
unable
to
take
advantage
of
the
opportunity
of
encircling
the
smaller
German
army
group
which
called
in
reinforcements
.


These
came
mostly
from
the
newly
mobilised

The

was
halted
on
20
February
.


Symbolically
coinciding
with
the
Estonian
Independence
Day
on
24
February
,
the
fresh
45th
and
46th
SS
Waffen
Grenadier
Regiments
(

operation
shed
light
was
a
crash
development
project
in
aerial
warfare
,
initiated
in
1966
by
the
united
states
air
force
to
increase
the
ability
to
accurately
strike
at
night
or
in
adverse
weather
.


During
the
1960s
the
United
States
military
worked
hard
to
interdict
the
movement
of
men
and
materiel
along
the
Ho
Chi
Minh
trail
.


The
North
Vietnamese
were
experts
in
the
use
of
weather
and
darkness
to
conceal
their
movement
,
and
understanding
the
superiority
of
American
air
power
put
their
skills
immediately
to
good
use
.


US
forces
seeking
to
impede
the
steady
flow
of
supplies
attempted
to
locate
largely
static
targets
during
the
day
with
poor
results
.


the
united
states
air
force
,
focused
toward
nuclear
weapons
and
delivery
of
such
munitions
against
static
strategic
targets
had
spent
little
effort
in
expanding
its
tactical
capabilities
since
the
end
of
world
war
ii
.


Operation
Shed
Light
sought
to
rectify
this
by
bringing
together
improved
tactics
and
technology
.


The
programs
were
subsequently
centered
on
improved
communication
and
navigation
aids
for
all-weather
and
night
flying
,
sensor
equipment
for
seeing
through
clouds
,
foliage
,
and
darkness
,
improved
equipment
and
methods
for
target
marking
and
battlefield
illumination
,
and
aircraft
and
tactics
to
utilize
these
developments
.


In
the
end
,
few
of
the
programs
would
yield
applicable
results
and
most
of
the
aircraft
developed
under
its
umbrella
would
largely
fall
into
obscurity
.


The
most
applicable
developments
were
those
that
could
be
mainstreamed
such
as
the
work
done
on
navigation
and
communication
and
sensor
equipment
.


The
Battle
of
Bazentin
Ridge
was
part
of
the
Battle
of
the
Somme
on
the
Western
Front
in
France
,
during
the
First
World
War
.


The
British
Fourth
Army
(
General
Henry
Rawlinson
)
made
a
dawn
attack
on
14
July
,
against
the
German
2nd
Army
(
General
Fritz
von
Below
)
in
the
Brown
Position
(
)
from
Delville
Wood
westwards
to
Bazentin
le
Petit
Wood
.


Dismissed
beforehand
by
a
French
commander
as
``
an
attack
organized
for
amateurs
by
amateurs
''
,
it
succeeded
.


Attempts
to
use
the
opportunity
to
capture
High
Wood
failed
,
due
to
the
German
success
in
holding
on
to
the
north
end
of
Longueval
and
parts
of
Delville
Wood
,
from
which
attacks
on
High
Wood
could
be
engaged
from
the
flank
.


British
cavalry
,
intended
to
provide
a
faster-moving
force
of
exploitation
,
were
badly
delayed
by
the
devastated
ground
,
shell-holes
and
derelict
trenches
.


In
the
afternoon
,
infantry
of
the
7th
Division
attacked
High
Wood
,
when
an
earlier
attack
could
have
entered
the
wood
unopposed
.


The
British
found
that
German
troops
had
occupied
parts
of
the
wood
and
also
held
the
Switch
Line
along
the
ridge
,
cutting
through
the
north-east
part
of
the
wood
.


Cavalry
eventually
attacked
east
of
the
wood
and
overran
German
infantry
hiding
in
standing
crops
,
inflicting
about
for
a
loss
of
eight
troopers
.


The
cavalry
attack
attack
was
assisted
by
an
artillery-observation
aircraft
,
whose
crew
saw
the
Germans
in
the
crops
and
fired
at
them
with
Lewis
guns
.


The
British
struggled
to
exploit
the
success
and
the
2nd
Army
recovered
,
leading
to
another
period
of
attritional
line
straightening
attacks
and
German
counter-attacks
,
before
the
British
and
French
general
attacks
of
mid-September
.


The
Action
of
30
June
1798
was
a
minor
naval
engagement
fought
along
the
Biscay
coast
of
France
during
the
French
Revolutionary
Wars
.


The
French
Navy
had
been
largely
driven
from
the
Atlantic
Ocean
early
in
the
war
following
heavy
losses
in
a
series
of
failed
operations
.


This
had
allowed
the
Royal
Navy
's
Channel
Fleet
to
institute
a
close
blockade
on
the
French
naval
ports
of
the
Biscay
coast
,
particularly
Brest
in
Brittany
.


The
blockade
strategy
included
a
constantly
patrolling
inshore
squadron
composed
of
frigates
,
tasked
with
preventing
the
passage
of
French
ships
into
or
out
of
the
port
.


In
the
spring
of
1798
,
several
French
frigates
stationed
in
the
Indian
Ocean
were
sent
back
to
France
as
the
base
at
Île
de
France
could
no
longer
supply
them
effectively
.


One
of
these
ships
was
the
40-gun
frigate
``
Seine
''
,
which
departed
Port
Louis
laden
with
280
soldiers
from
the
garrison
.


``
Seine
''
had
a
rapid
passage
back
to
European
waters
,
arriving
in
the
Bay
of
Biscay
on
28
June
.


Early
the
following
morning
,
with
the
Brittany
coast
in
sight
,
``
Seine
''
was
spotted
by
the
inshore
frigate
squadron
of
HMS
``
Jason
''
,
HMS
``
Pique
''
and
HMS
``
Mermaid
''
.


While
``
Mermaid
''
cut
``
Seine
''
off
from
the
coast
,
``
Jason
''
and
``
Pique
''
gave
chase
as
``
Seine
''
fled
southwards
.


``
Pique
''
reached
``
Seine
''
at
23:00
that
evening
and
for
more
than
two
and
a
half
hours
the
frigates
pounded
at
one
another
until
``
Pique
''
fell
back
.


``
Pique
''
and
``
Jason
''
continued
the
chase
full
speed
through
the
night
,
until
suddenly
all
three
frigates
crashed
headlong
into
the
sandbanks
off
La
Tranche-sur-Mer
on
the
Vendée
coast
.


Even
while
grounded
the
frigates
continued
to
fire
on
one
another
until
``
Mermaid
''
finally
arrived
and
the
outnumbered
``
Seine
''
surrendered
.


``
Jason
''
and
``
Seine
''
were
badly
damaged
but
successfully
refloated
,
the
casualties
on
the
packed
decks
of
the
French
ship
appallingly
high
,
but
``
Pique
''
was
an
irretrievable
wreck
:
the
ship
was
evacuated
and
then
burnt
before
the
remainder
of
the
squadron
returned
to
Britain
with
their
prize
.


The
Action
of
12
May
1796
was
a
minor
naval
engagement
during
the
French
Revolutionary
Wars
between
a
squadron
of
British
Royal
Navy
frigates
and
a
frigate
and
four
smaller
ships
of
the
Batavian
Navy
.


The
British
squadron
had
been
detached
on
the
previous
day
from
the
British
North
Sea
fleet
under
Admiral
Adam
Duncan
,
which
was
cruising
off
the
Batavian
fleet
anchorage
at
the
Texel
,
while
the
Batavian
squadron
was
returning
to
the
Netherlands
from
the
Norwegian
coast
where
it
had
been
sheltering
since
suffering
defeat
at
the
Action
of
22
August
1795
the
previous
year
.


As
the
Batavian
squadron
neared
the
Batavian
coast
,
the
British
squadron
under
Captain
Lawrence
Halstead
attacked
.


In
his
frigate
HMS
``
Phoenix
''
,
Halstead
was
able
to
cut
the
Batavian
frigate
``
Argo
''
off
from
the
shore
and
bring
it
to
battle
,
forcing
it
to
surrender
in
just
20
minutes
as
other
British
ships
closed
with
the
combat
.


The
remainder
of
the
Batavian
squadron
had
dispersed
eastwards
away
from
the
frigates
and
Duncan
's
fleet
,
pursued
by
the
frigate
HMS
``
Pegasus
''
and
brig-sloop
HMS
``
Sylph
''
.


After
a
lengthy
chase
,
``
Phoenix
''
caught
the
cutter
``
Duke
of
York
''
,
``
Sylph
''
seized
the
brig
``
Mercury
''
,
while
``
Pegasus
''
succeeded
in
driving
the
other
brigs
,
``
Echo
''
and
``
Gier
''
ashore
,
where
both
were
believed
wrecked
.


Duncan
's
blockade
of
the
Texel
was
instrumental
in
British
control
of
the
North
Sea
,
and
a
year
later
it
would
achieve
a
decisive
victory
at
the
Battle
of
Camperdown
.


The
June
2011
Peshawar
bombings
occurred
on
12
June
2011
in
Peshawar
,
Khyber
Pakhtunkhwa
,
Pakistan
.


At
least
34
people
were
killed
,
and
more
than
90
were
injured
,
when
two
bombs
exploded
in
a
market
around
midnight
.


The
first
bomb
went
off
around
11:50
p.m.
local
time
in
Khyber
market
area
,
which
is
a
commercial
and
residential
area
,
and
injured
3
people
.


After
a
crowd
gathered
in
the
area
,
a
teen-aged
suicide
bomber
on
a
motorcycle
set
off
a
second
explosion
,
killing
many
people
on
the
spot
.


About
of
explosives
were
used
in
the
second
blast
according
to
officials
.


Police
and
rescue
teams
soon
reached
the
spot
and
cordoned
the
area
.


The
Battle
of
Kujin
(
25–26
October
1950
)
,
also
known
as
the
Battle
of
the
Broken
Bridge
,
took
place
during
the
United
Nations
Command
(
UN
)
offensive
towards
the
Yalu
River
,
which
followed
the
North
Korean
invasion
of
South
Korea
at
the
start
of
the
Korean
War
.


The
battle
was
fought
between
Australian
forces
from
3rd
Battalion
,
Royal
Australian
Regiment
(
3
RAR
)
and
elements
of
the
17th
Tank
Brigade
of
the
Korean
People
's
Army
(
KPA
)
over
a
key
bridge
across
the
Taeryong
River
near
Kujin
,
North
Korea
.


On
25
October
the
27th
British
Commonwealth
Brigade
had
resumed
their
advance
towards
Pakchon
after
crossing
the
Chongchon
River
,
with
3
RAR
as
the
lead
battalion
.


Arriving
at
Kujin
,
the
Australians
discovered
that
the
centre
span
of
the
concrete
bridge
had
been
demolished
by
KPA
engineers
,
blocking
their
passage
across
the
river
.


A
platoon-sized
reconnaissance
patrol
crossed
the
river
using
debris
from
the
destroyed
span
;
however
,
it
was
soon
forced
to
withdraw
by
KPA
holding
the
high
ground
.


Airstrikes
and
artillery
fire
were
subsequently
called-in
at
17:15
by
the
Australians
as
they
prepared
to
conduct
an
assault
.


at
19:00
that
evening
,
following
the
clearance
of
nearby
unk
by
d
company
3
rar
,
the
australians
sent
two
companies
across
the
river
to
establish
a
bridgehead
and
prevent
the
kpa
from
consolidating
their
position
on
the
western
bank
.


A
and
B
Companies
subsequently
established
defensive
positions
on
either
side
of
the
road
.


Shortly
afterwards
KPA
forces
were
detected
forming
up
for
an
assault
on
the
right
flank
against
B
Company
,
and
these
preparations
were
broken
up
with
mortars
.


The
KPA
then
engaged
the
forward
Australian
companies
with
mortar
fire
which
was
largely
ineffective
.


However
,
by
22:30
KPA
activity
increased
significantly
,
with
heavy
small
arms
fire
causing
a
number
of
casualties
among
the
Australians
which
perilously
had
to
be
evacuated
under
fire
by
boat
across
the
fast
flowing
tidal
river
.


Further
artillery
support
was
called-in
by
the
Australians
at
23:00
in
response
to
renewed
concentrations
by
the
KPA
in
preparation
for
an
assault
.


Meanwhile
,
the
Australians
sent
another
platoon
across
the
river
to
reinforce
the
companies
on
the
western
bank
.


at
04:00
on
26
october
the
kpa
counterattacked
a
and
b
companies
,
supported
by
a
two
t-34
tanks
.


In
the
ensuing
fighting
a
convoy
of
KPA
vehicles
,
including
a
tank
,
two
jeeps
,
a
motorcycle
and
about
60
infantry
moved
down
the
road
towards
A
Company
with
the
intention
of
re-occupying
the
ridges
overlooking
the
river
crossing
.


The
Australians
ambushed
the
convoy
at
close
range
with
small
arms
fire
and
mortars
,
forcing
the
KPA
to
flee
after
abandoning
their
vehicles
with
only
the
tank
successfully
shooting
its
way
out
.


Later
another
T-34
tank
and
supporting
infantry
pressed
to
within
of
the
B
Company
headquarters
,
before
stopping
and
taking
up
a
position
between
the
ridges
unaware
of
the
location
of
the
Australians
.


By
dawn
the
Australians
were
still
in
possession
of
the
bridgehead
.


At
07:00
,
a
further
airstrike
was
called-in
on
the
KPA
holding
the
ridges
to
the
west
of
the
3
RAR
positions
.


With
the
way
reported
clear
,
C
and
D
Companies
crossed
the
river
from
the
eastern
bank
later
that
morning
.


The
battle
continued
during
the
morning
;
however
,
by
12:00
the
KPA
finally
withdrew
,
abandoning
the
bridge
to
the
Australians
.


The
Battle
of
Rennell
Island
(
Japanese
:
レンネル島沖海戦
)
took
place
on
29–30
January
1943
.


It
was
the
last
major
naval
engagement
between
the
United
States
Navy
and
the
Imperial
Japanese
Navy
during
the
Guadalcanal
Campaign
of
World
War
II
.


It
occurred
in
the
South
Pacific
between
Rennell
Island
and
Guadalcanal
in
the
southern
Solomon
Islands
.


In
the
battle
,
Japanese
naval
land-based
torpedo
bombers
,
seeking
to
provide
protection
for
the
impending
evacuation
of
Japanese
forces
from
Guadalcanal
,
made
several
attacks
over
two
days
on
U.S.
warships
operating
as
a
task
force
south
of
this
island
.


In
addition
to
approaching
Guadalcanal
with
the
objective
of
engaging
any
Japanese
ships
that
might
come
into
range
,
the
U.S.
task
force
was
protecting
an
Allied
transport
ship
convoy
carrying
replacement
troops
there
.


As
a
result
of
the
Japanese
air
attacks
on
the
task
force
,
one
U.S.
heavy
cruiser
was
sunk
,
a
destroyer
was
heavily
damaged
,
and
the
rest
of
the
U.S.
task
force
was
forced
to
retreat
from
the
southern
Solomons
area
.


Partly
because
they
turned
back
the
U.S.
task
force
in
this
battle
,
the
Japanese
successfully
evacuated
their
remaining
troops
from
Guadalcanal
by
7
February
1943
,
leaving
it
in
the
hands
of
the
Allies
and
ending
the
battle
for
the
island
.


The
German
attacks
on
Nauru
refers
to
the
two
attacks
on
Nauru
in
December
1940
.


Nauru
is
an
island
country
in
Micronesia
,
a
subregion
of
Oceania
,
in
the
Central
Pacific
.


These
attacks
were
conducted
by
auxiliary
cruisers
between
6
and
8
December
and
on
27
December
.


The
raiders
sank
five
Allied
merchant
ships
and
inflicted
serious
damage
on
Nauru
's
economically
important
phosphate-loading
facilities
.


Despite
the
significance
of
the
island
to
the
Australian
and
New
Zealand
economies
,
Nauru
was
not
defended
and
the
German
force
did
not
suffer
any
losses
.


The
two
attacks
were
the
most
effective
operations
conducted
by
German
raiders
in
the
Pacific
Ocean
during
World
War
II
.


They
disrupted
supplies
of
phosphate
to
Australia
,
New
Zealand
and
Japan
,
which
reduced
agricultural
production
in
these
countries
.


In
response
,
Allied
naval
vessels
were
deployed
to
protect
Nauru
and
nearby
Ocean
Island
and
escort
shipping
in
the
South
Pacific
.


Small
garrisons
were
also
established
to
protect
the
two
islands
.


Operation
Vigorous
(
``
Battaglia
di
mezzo
giugno
''
1942
,
the
Battle
of
mid-June
1942
)
was
a
British
operation
during
the
Second
World
War
,
to
escort
supply
convoy
MW11
from
the
eastern
Mediterranean
to
Malta
,
which
took
place
from
1942
.


Vigorous
was
part
of
Operation
Julius
,
a
simultaneous
operation
with
Operation
Harpoon
from
Gibraltar
and
supporting
operations
.


Sub-convoy
MW11c
sailed
from
Port
Said
on
11
June
,
to
tempt
the
Italian
battlefleet
to
sail
early
,
use
up
fuel
and
be
exposed
to
submarine
and
air
attack
.


MW11a
and
MW11b
sailed
next
day
from
Haifa
,
Port
Said
and
Alexandria
,
one
ship
being
sent
back
because
of
defects
.


Italian
and
German
(
Axis
)
aircraft
attacked
MW11c
on
12
June
and
a
damaged
ship
was
diverted
to
Tobruk
,
just
east
of
Gazala
.

were
revealed
unwittingly
to
the
Axis
by
the
US
Military
Attaché
in
Egypt
,
Colonel
Bonner
Fellers
,
who
reported
to
Washington
,
D.C.
in
coded
wireless
messages
.


The
Black
Code
was
later
revealed
by
Ultra
to
have
been
broken
by
the
``
Servizio
Informazioni
Militare
''
(
Italian
military
intelligence
)
.


The
convoy
and
escorts
sailed
through
``
Bomb
Alley
''
between
Crete
and
Cyrenaica
under
attack
from
Axis
bombers
,
dive-bombers
,
torpedo-bombers
,
E-boats
and
submarines
and
were
then
threatened
by
the
sailing
of
an
Italian
battlefleet
from
Taranto
.


The
British
relied
on
aircraft
and
submarines
to
repel
the
Italian
fleet
in
the
absence
of
battleships
and
aircraft
carriers
but
only
one
heavy
cruiser
was
sunk
.


When
the
Italian
battleships
were
within
the
British
convoy
and
escorts
were
ordered
to
turn
back
and
wait
for
the
Italians
to
suffer
losses
from
torpedo-bombers
,
bombers
and
submarines
but
little
more
damage
was
inflicted
and
after
several
more
turns
towards
and
away
from
Malta
,
the
convoy
and
escorts
returned
to
Alexandria
on
16
June
.


The
Battle
of
Gazala
(
26
May
–
21
June
)
was
being
fought
in
Libya
during
Operation
Julius
and
beginning
on
14
June
,
the
British
defeat
forced
the
Eighth
Army
to
withdraw
eastwards
,
losing
landing
grounds
from
which
aircraft
could
provide
air
cover
for
MW11
.


Operation
Julius
was
a
British
defeat
,
only
two
merchant
ships
from
Operation
Harpoon
,
the
simultaneous
convoy
from
Gibraltar
,
reaching
Malta
to
deliver
supplies
.


In
the
absence
of
air
cover
and
the
suppression
of
Axis
air
power
lining
the
routes
to
Malta
,
the
central
Mediterranean
had
been
closed
to
British
ships
.


Malta
could
not
be
revived
as
an
offensive
base
and
to
provide
some
aviation
fuel
for
the
defending
fighters
,
the
British
resorted
to
the
expedient
of
running
supplies
through
the
blockade
by
submarine
.


No
more
convoys
were
attempted
from
the
eastern
Mediterranean
until
the
Eighth
Army
conquered
Libya
in
October
.


More
Spitfires
were
delivered
to
Malta
during
July
and
increasing
losses
forced
the
``
Luftwaffe
''
and
``
Regia
Aeronautica
''
to
reduce
the
tempo
of
operations
.


A
limited
return
to
offensive
operations
was
made
against
Axis
convoys
to
Libya
and
Operation
Pedestal
in
August
delivered
four
merchant
ships
and
an
oil
tanker
from
Gibraltar
,
which
further
revived
Malta
as
an
offensive
base
,
despite
the
loss
of
most
of
the
convoy
and
many
naval
ships
.


The
Action
of
21
October
1794
was
a
minor
naval
engagement
between
Great
Britain
and
France
fought
off
the
Breton
coast
of
France
during
the
second
year
of
the
French
Revolutionary
Wars
.


French
frigates
had
been
raiding
British
Atlantic
trade
routes
with
considerable
success
since
the
outbreak
of
the
war
,
and
in
response
the
Admiralty
had
formed
a
frigate
squadron
to
patrol
the
French
Channel
and
Atlantic
coasts
in
search
of
French
raiders
.


On
13
October
1794
,
the
large
,
modern
and
powerful
40-gun
French
frigate
``
Révolutionnaire
''
under
the
command
of
Captain
Antoine
René
Thévenard
sailed
from
Le
Havre
for
a
raiding
cruise
against
British
trade
routes
in
the
Atlantic
.


Eight
days
later
,
while
rounding
the
Breton
headland
of
Ushant
about
25–
out
to
sea
,
``
Révolutionnaire
''
encountered
the
British
frigate
squadron
,
commanded
by
Commodore
Sir
Edward
Pellew
,
which
had
secured
a
number
of
victories
over
French
raiding
frigates
during
the
previous
two
years
.


Pellew
ordered
his
ships
to
give
chase
,
as
Thévenard
fled
towards
the
French
coast
before
the
British
numerical
supremacy
.


One
British
ship
was
faster
than
the
others
,
the
38-gun
HMS
``
Artois
''
under
Captain
Edmund
Nagle
cutting
``
Révolutionnaire
''
off
from
the
shore
and
bringing
the
larger
French
ship
to
action
.


For
45
minutes
``
Artois
''
battled
``
Révolutionnaire
''
until
support
arrived
,
at
which
point
the
French
frigate
's
crew
surrendered
their
ship
in
defiance
of
their
captain
's
orders
.


Casualties
and
damage
were
light
on
both
sides
,
and
``
Révolutionnaire
''
was
rapidly
commissioned
into
the
Royal
Navy
,
joining
the
squadron
that
had
captured
her
and
subsequently
capturing
the
French
frigate
``
Unité
''
at
the
Action
of
13
April
1796
.


The
Action
of
25
September
1806
was
a
naval
battle
fought
during
the
Napoleonic
Wars
off
the
French
Biscay
port
of
Rochefort
.


A
French
squadron
comprising
five
frigates
and
two
corvettes
,
sailing
to
the
French
West
Indies
with
supplies
and
reinforcements
,
was
intercepted
by
a
British
squadron
of
six
ships
of
the
line
that
was
keeping
a
close
blockade
of
the
port
as
part
of
the
Atlantic
campaign
of
1806
.


The
British
ships
,
under
the
command
of
Commodore
Sir
Samuel
Hood
,
spotted
the
French
convoy
early
in
the
morning
of
25
September
,
just
a
few
hours
after
the
French
had
left
port
,
and
immediately
gave
chase
.


although
the
french
ships
tried
to
escape
,
they
were
heavily
laden
with
troops
and
stores
,
and
the
strong
winds
favoured
the
larger
ships
of
the
line
,
which
caught
the
french
convoy
after
a
five-hour
pursuit
,
although
they
had
become
separated
from
one
another
during
the
chase
.


at
05:00
the
leading
british
ship
,
hms
``
monarch
''
,
was
within
range
and
opened
fire
on
the
french
squadron
,
which
divided
.


One
frigate
went
north
and
was
intercepted
by
HMS
``
Mars
''
,
while
another
,
accompanied
by
the
two
corvettes
,
turned
south
and
managed
to
outrun
HMS
``
Windsor
Castle
''
.


The
main
body
of
the
French
force
remained
together
and
met
the
attack
of
``
Monarch
''
and
the
British
flagship
HMS
``
Centaur
''
with
their
broadsides
.


although
outnumbered
and
outclassed
by
the
british
squadron
the
french
ships
fought
hard
,
inflicting
damage
on
the
leading
british
ships
and
severely
wounding
commodore
hood
.


Eventually
the
strength
of
the
British
squadron
told
,
and
despite
a
fierce
resistance
the
French
ships
surrendered
one
by
one
,
the
British
capturing
four
of
the
seven
vessels
in
the
squadron
.


Capital
Airlines
Flight
20
was
a
U.S.
scheduled
passenger
flight
from
Washington
,
D.C.
to
Norfolk
,
Virginia
.


A
Vickers
Viscount
flying
the
route
crashed
into
a
farm
in
Charles
City
County
,
Virginia
,
on
January
18
,
1960
.


The
accident
was
the
fourth
fatal
crash
involving
a
Capital
Viscount
in
less
than
two
years
;
the
first
three
were
Capital
Airlines
Flight
67
(
April
1958
)
,
Capital
Airlines
Flight
300
(
May
1958
)
and
Capital
Airlines
Flight
75
(
May
1959
)
.


The
plane
was
cruising
at
an
altitude
of
8,000
feet
when
it
encountered
icing
.


This
caused
two
engines
to
fail
.


As
the
craft
descended
,
the
other
two
engines
also
failed
,
causing
the
propellers
to
autofeather
.


The
crew
tried
and
failed
to
restart
the
engines
,
and
were
unable
to
unfeather
the
propellers
normally
;
they
then
put
the
plane
into
a
dive
in
an
attempt
to
force
the
propellers
from
their
feathered
position
.


Eventually
they
succeeded
in
restarting
engine
number
four
.


They
applied
full
power
to
this
engine
,
which
caused
the
craft
to
enter
a
circling
descent
until
crashing
into
trees
;
at
the
time
of
impact
it
had
almost
no
forward
velocity
.


Five
trees
were
driven
through
the
fuselage
,
yet
their
trunks
remained
intact
.


The
crash
was
attributed
to
the
fact
that
,
as
per
airline
policy
,
the
pilots
had
delayed
arming
the
engine
ice
protection
systems
even
though
they
were
flying
in
icy
conditions
;
this
caused
the
engines
to
lose
too
much
power
.


Capital
Airlines
changed
its
emergency
checklist
after
the
crash
,
deleting
the
instruction
that
pilots
were
to
descend
to
a
warmer
climate
to
relight
the
systems
and
instructing
them
that
,
provided
that
correct
procedure
was
followed
,
the
engine
could
be
restarted
at
any
height
.


Braathen
SAFE
Flight
239
,
also
known
as
the
Asker
Accident
(
)
,
was
a
controlled
flight
into
terrain
of
a
Fokker
F28
Fellowship
into
Vestmarka
in
Asker
,
Norway
,
on
23
December
1972
at
16:33
.


The
Braathens
SAFE
aircraft
was
en
route
on
a
scheduled
flight
from
Ålesund
Airport
,
Vigra
and
crashed
during
approach
to
Oslo
Airport
,
Fornebu
.


Forty
of
the
forty-five
people
on
board
the
aircraft
were
killed
,
making
it
the
deadliest
civil
aviation
accident
in
Norway
until
1996
.


According
to
Norwegian
newspaper
Dagbladet
December
23
,
1992
,
a
Danish
citizen
died
of
late
complications
in
1976
.


The
pilots
took
a
short-cut
during
approach
on
runway
06
at
Fornebu
.


Combined
with
false
signals
from
the
instrument
landing
system
(
ILS
)
,
this
caused
the
pilots
to
misunderstand
their
location
.


This
in
turn
led
them
to
take
an
incorrect
landing
path
,
causing
the
plane
to
hit
ground
in
a
hilly
area
.


The
rescue
operation
was
initiated
almost
immediately
,
but
it
took
six
and
a
half
hours
to
find
the
aircraft
.


Three
years
later
,
the
investigation
commission
concluded
that
various
measures
should
be
put
in
place
to
improve
navigation
,
to
avoid
similar
situations
in
which
pilots
misunderstood
their
location
.


Cathay
Pacific
Flight

was
a
flight
from
Surabaya
Juanda
International
Airport
in
Indonesia
to
Hong
Kong
International
Airport
on
13
April
2010
.


There
were
309
passengers
and
a
crew
of
13
on
board
.


As
Flight
780
neared
Hong
Kong
the
crew
were
unable
to
change
the
thrust
output
of
the
engines
.


The
aircraft
,
an
Airbus
A330-342
,
landed
at
almost
twice
the
speed
of
a
normal
landing
,
suffering
minor
damage
.


The
57
passengers
who
sustained
injuries
were
hurt
in
the
ensuing
slide
evacuation
;
one
of
them
received
serious
injuries
.


The
cause
of
the
accident
was
contamination
of
the
fuel
uploaded
at
Surabaya
,
which
gradually
damaged
both
engines
of
the
aircraft
.


The
flight
's
two
Australian
pilots
,
Captain
Malcolm
Waters
and
First
Officer
David
Hayhoe
,
who
safely
landed
the
aircraft
despite
the
extraordinary
challenge
,
have
been
compared
to
pilots
Chesley
Sullenberger
and
Jeffrey
Skiles
of
US
Airways
Flight
1549
the
previous
year
(
January
2009
)
.


In
March
2014
,
the
two
Flight

pilots
were
awarded
the
Polaris

On
29
September
1940
,
a
mid-air
collision
occurred
over
Brocklesby
,

The
accident
was
unusual
in
that
the
aircraft
involved

The
collision
stopped
the
engines
of
the
upper

,
but
those
of
the
machine
underneath
continued
to
run
,
allowing
the
aircraft
to
keep
flying
.


Both
navigators
and
the
pilot
of
the
lower

bailed
out
.


The
pilot
of
the
upper

found
that
he
was
able
to
control
the
interlocked
aircraft
with
his
ailerons
and

,
and
made
an
emergency
landing
in

survived
the
incident
,
and
the

was
repaired
and

The
Airbus
A300
jet
liner
was
en
route
from
Ngurah
Rai
Airport
in
Bali
,
Indonesia
to
Taipei
,
Taiwan
.


The
weather
was
inclement
with
rain
and
fog
when
the
aircraft
approached
Chiang
Kai-shek
International
Airport
,
so
the
pilot
executed
a
missed
approach
.


After
the
jet
was
cleared
to
land
at
runway
05L
,
the
autopilot
was
disengaged
,
and
the
pilots
then
attempted
a
manual
go-around
.


The
jet
slowed
down
,
pitched
up
by
40
degrees
,
rose
,
stalled
,
and
crashed
into
a
residential
neighborhood
,
bursting
into
flames
at
local
time
4:20
PM
.


All
196
people
on
board
were
killed
(
including
the
governor
of
Taiwan
's
central
bank
,
Sheu
Yuan-dong
,
his
wife
,
Huang

station
,
said
that
one
boy
was
pulled
alive
from
the
wreckage
and
later
died
.


It
remains
the
deadliest
aviation
accident
on
Taiwanese
soil
.


China

had
twelve
A300s
in
its

at
the
time
of
the

It
is
also
the
second
deadliest

scheduled
passenger
flight
from

.


On
10
July
2002
,
the
flight
was
unable
to
land
at
Fuhlsbüttel
Airport
due
to
weather
.


Attempts
were
made
to
divert
to
other
airports
at
Berlin
and
Eberswalde
before
the
crew
decided
to
land
at
Werneuchen
.


On
landing
,
the
aircraft
struck
an
earth
bank
which
ripped
off
all
three
undercarriage
legs
,
and
came
to
rest
on
its
belly
with
an
engine
on
fire
.


One
of
the
sixteen
passengers
suffered
minor
injuries
.


The
aircraft
was
written
off
.


The
investigation
into
the
accident
by
the
German
Federal
Bureau
of
Aircraft
Accident
Investigation
(
BFU
)
took
over
eight
years
to
complete
.


It
raised
a
number
of
issues
,
including
poor
crew
resource
management
,
insufficient
weather
information
being
passed
to
the
crew
of
Flight
850
and
faulty
runway
markings
at
Werneuchen
Airfield
,
where
the
runway
had
been
reduced
in
length
from

markings
had
not
been
altered
to
reflect
this

The
Mediterranean
campaign
of
1798
was
a
series
of
major
naval
operations
surrounding
a
French
expeditionary
force
sent
to
Egypt
under
Napoleon
Bonaparte
during
the
French
Revolutionary
Wars
.


The
French
Republic
sought
to
capture
Egypt
as
the
first
stage
in
an
effort
to
threaten
British
India
and
support
Tipu
Sultan
,
and
thus
force
Great
Britain
to
make
peace
.


Departing
Toulon
in
May
1798
with
over
40,000
troops
and
hundreds
of
ships
,
Bonaparte
's
fleet
sailed
southeastwards
across
the
Mediterranean
Sea
.


They
were
followed
by
a
small
British
squadron
under
Rear-Admiral
Sir
Horatio
Nelson
,
later
reinforced
to
13
ships
of
the
line
,
whose
pursuit
was
hampered
by
a
lack
of
scouting
frigates
and
reliable
information
.


Bonaparte
's
first
target
was
the
island
of
Malta
,
which
was
under
the
government
of
the
Knights
of
St.
John
and
theoretically
granted
its
owner
control
of
the
Central
Mediterranean
.


Bonaparte
's
forces
landed
on
the
island
and
rapidly
overwhelmed
the
defenders
,
securing
the
port
city
of
Valletta
before
continuing
to
Egypt
.


When
Nelson
learned
of
the
French
capture
of
the
island
,
he
guessed
the
French
target
to
be
Egypt
and
sailed
for
Alexandria
,
but
passed
the
French
during
the
night
of
22
June
without
discovering
them
and
arrived
off
Egypt
first
.


Unable
to
find
Bonaparte
,
Nelson
turned
back
across
the
Mediterranean
,
eventually
reaching
Sicily
on
19
July
.


While
Nelson
was
returning
westwards
,
Bonaparte
reached
Alexandria
and
stormed
the
city
,
capturing
the
coast
and
marching
his
army
inland
.


His
fleet
,
entrusted
to
Vice-Admiral
François-Paul
Brueys
D'Aigalliers
,
was
anchored
in
a
line
of
battle
in
Aboukir
Bay
.


On
1
August
,
Nelson
,
who
had
returned
to
the
Egyptian
coast
after
reports
gathered
at
Coron
revealed
the
French
invasion
,
arrived
off
Aboukir
Bay
.


although
it
was
late
afternoon
and
the
british
fleet
had
no
accurate
charts
of
the
bay
,
nelson
ordered
an
immediate
attack
on
the
french
van
.


Brueys
was
unprepared
,
and
his
ships
were
unable
to
manoeuvre
as
the
British
split
into
two
divisions
and
sailed
down
either
side
of
the
French
line
,
capturing
all
five
ships
of
the
vanguard
and
engaging
his
120-gun
flagship
``
Orient
''
in
the
centre
.


at
21:00
,
``
orient
''
caught
fire
and
exploded
,
killing
most
of
the
crew
and
ending
the
main
combat
.


Sporadic
fighting
continued
for
the
next
two
days
,
until
all
of
the
French
ships
had
been
captured
,
destroyed
or
fled
.


at
the
battle
of
the
nile
,
eleven
french
ships
of
the
line
and
two
frigates
were
eliminated
,
trapping
bonaparte
in
egypt
and
changing
the
balance
of
power
in
the
mediterranean
.


With
the
French
Navy
in
the
Mediterranean
defeated
,
other
nations
were
encouraged
to
join
the
Second
Coalition
and
go
to
war
with
France
.


Portugal
,
the
Kingdom
of
Naples
,
the
Russian
Empire
and
the
Ottoman
Empire
all
subsequently
deployed
forces
to
the
Mediterranean
.


The
Russians
and
Turks
participated
in
the
blockade
of
Egypt
and
operations
in
the
Adriatic
Sea
while
the
Portuguese
joined
the
Siege
of
Malta
,
which
was
distantly
conducted
by
Nelson
from
his
lodgings
in
Naples
.


Nelson
,
who
had
been
wounded
at
the
Battle
of
the
Nile
,
became
involved
in
Neapolitan
politics
and
encouraged
King
Ferdinand
to
go
to
war
with
France
,
resulting
in
the
loss
of
his
mainland
kingdom
.


In
the
Western
Mediterranean
,
Vice-Admiral
Earl
St
Vincent
,
who
commanded
the
Mediterranean
fleet
from
off
Cadiz
,
deployed
forces
against
Menorca
,
rapidly
captured
the
island
and
turned
it
into
an
important
naval
base
.

war

also
known
as
the
greek
revolution

by

in
the
19th
century
as

,
``
struggle
''
;
ottoman
:
unk

``
yunan

''
,
``

''
)
,
was
a
successful
war
of
independence
waged
by
greek
revolutionaries
against
the
ottoman
empire
between
1821
and
1830
.


The
Greeks
were
later
assisted
by
the
Russian
Empire
,
Great
Britain
,
and
the
Kingdom
of
France
,
while
the
Ottomans
were
aided
by
their
North
African
vassals
,
the
eyalets
of
Egypt
,
Algeria
,
and
Tripolitania
,
and
the
Beylik
of
Tunis
.


Even
several
decades
before
the
fall
of
Constantinople
to
the
Ottoman
Empire
in
1453
,
most
of
Greece
had
come
under
Ottoman
rule
.


During
this
time
,
there
were
several
revolt
attempts
by
Greeks
to
gain
independence
from
Ottoman
control
.


In
1814
,
a
secret
organization
called
the
Filiki
Eteria
was
founded
with
the
aim
of
liberating
Greece
.


The
Filiki
Eteria
planned
to
launch
revolts
in
the
Peloponnese
,
the
Danubian
Principalities
,
and
in
Constantinople
and
its
surrounding
areas
.


by
late
1821
,
the
insurrection
had
been
planned
for
25
march
(
julian
calendar
)
1821
,
on
the
feast
of
the
annunciation
for
the
orthodox
christians
.


However
,
as
the
plans
of
Filiki
Eteria
had
been
discovered
by
the
Ottoman
authorities
,
the
revolutionary
action
started
earlier
.


The
first
of
these
revolts
began
on
6
March/21
February
1821
in
the
Danubian
Principalities
,
but
it
was
soon
put
down
by
the
Ottomans
.


The
events
in
the
north
urged
the
Greeks
in
the
Peloponnese
into
action
and
on
17
March
1821
,
the
Maniots
declared
war
on
the
Ottomans
.


This
declaration
was
the
start
of
a
spring
of
revolutionary
actions
from
other
controlled
states
against
the
Ottoman
Empire
.


On
25
March
the
revolution
was
officially
declared
and
by
the
end
of
the
month
,
the
Peloponnese
was
in
open
revolt
against
the
Turks
.


By
October
1821
,
the
Greeks
under
Theodoros
Kolokotronis
had
captured
Tripolitsa
.


The
Peloponnesian
revolt
was
quickly
followed
by
revolts
in
Crete
,
Macedonia
,
and
Central
Greece
,
which
would
soon
be
suppressed
.


Meanwhile
,
the
makeshift
Greek
navy
was
achieving
success
against
the
Ottoman
navy
in
the
Aegean
Sea
and
prevented
Ottoman
reinforcements
from
arriving
by
sea
.


Tensions
soon
developed
among
different
Greek
factions
,
leading
to
two
consecutive
civil
wars
.


In
the
meantime
,
the
Ottoman
Sultan
negotiated
with
Mehmet
Ali
of
Egypt
,
who
agreed
to
send
his
son
Ibrahim
Pasha
to
Greece
with
an
army
to
suppress
the
revolt
in
return
for
territorial
gain
.


Ibrahim
landed
in
the
Peloponnese
in
February
1825
and
had
immediate
success
:
by
the
end
of
1825
,
most
of
the
Peloponnese
was
under
Egyptian
control
,
and
the
city
of
Missolonghi
fell
in
April
1826
after
a
year-long
siege
by
the
Turks
.


although
ibrahim
was
defeated
in
mani
,
he
had
succeeded
in
suppressing
most
of
the
revolt
in
the
peloponnese
,
and
athens
had
been
retaken
.


Following
years
of
negotiation
,
three
Great
Powers—Russia
,
Britain
and
France—decided
to
intervene
in
the
conflict
and
each
nation
sent
a
navy
to
Greece
.


Following
news
that
combined
Ottoman–Egyptian
fleets
were
going
to
attack
the
Greek
island
of
Hydra
,
the
allied
fleet
intercepted
the
Ottoman–Egyptian
fleet
at
Navarino
.


The
battle
began
after
a
tense
week-long
standoff
,
ending
in
the
destruction
of
the
Ottoman–Egyptian
fleet
.


By
1828
the
Egyptian
army
withdrew
under
pressure
of
a
French
expeditionary
force
to
which
the
Ottoman
garrisons
in
the
Peloponnese
then
surrendered
,
while
the
Greeks
proceeded
to
the
Ottoman-controlled
part
of
central
Greece
.


After
eight
years
of
war
,
Greece
was
finally
recognized
as
an
independent
,
sovereign
state
under
the
London
Protocol
of
February
1830
.


later
,
in
1832
,
the
london
conference
and
the
treaty
of
constantinople
defined
the
final
borders
of
the
new
state
and
established
prince
otto
of
bavaria
as
the
first
king
of
greece
.


the
greek
revolution
is
celebrated
by
the
modern
greek
state
as
a
national
day
on
25
march
.

the
second
one
experienced
by
All

that
year
,
the

Weather
conditions
and
change
in
punting
rule
.


Because
of
strong
winds
of
up
,
CFL
officials
,
in
agreement
with
both
head
coaches
,
Bud
Grant
for
Winnipeg
and
Ralph
Sazio
for
Hamilton
,
changed
a
punting
rule
prior
to
the
game
,
perhaps
unprecedented
in
CFL
if
not
in
football
history
.


Instead
of
punts
being
returned
with
no
Fair
catch
rule
,
punts
into
the
wind
would
be
ruled
dead
as
soon
as
the
returner
touched
the
ball
,
a
sort
of
forced
Fair
catch
rule
,
the
rule
being
voluntary
in
the
National
Football
League
.


Without
the
rule
change
,
it
was
thought
that
the
team
going
against
the
wind
would
lose
the
viable
option
of
punting
and
be
forced
instead
to
try
to
convert

On
13
January
2012
,
the
Italian
cruise
ship
``

''
ran
aground
and
overturned
after
striking
an
underwater
rock
off
Isola
del
Giglio
,
Tuscany
,
resulting
in
32
deaths
.


The
eight
year
old
Costa
Cruises
vessel
was
on
the
first
leg
of
a
cruise
around
the
Mediterranean
Sea
when
she
deviated
from
her
planned
route
at
the
Isola
del
Giglio
,
sailed
closer
to
the
island
,
and
struck
a
rock
formation
on
the
sea
floor
.


A
six-hour
rescue
effort
brought
most
of
the
passengers
ashore
.


``
Costa
Concordia
''
was
officially
declared
a
``
constructive
total
loss
''
by
the
cruise
line
's
insurer
,
and
her
salvage
was
``
one
of
the
biggest
maritime
salvage
operations
.
''


On

September
2013
,
the
parbuckle
salvage
of
the
ship
began
,
and
by
the
early
hours
of
17
September
,
the
ship
was
set
upright
on
its
underwater
cradle
.


In
July
2014
,
the
ship
was
refloated
by
large
sponsons
(
metal
tanks
)
welded
to
its
sides
and
was
towed
320
kilometres
(
200
miles
)
to
its
home
port
of
Genoa
for
scrapping
,
which
was
finished
in

.


The
total
cost
of
the
disaster
,
including
victims
'
compensation
,
refloating
,
towing
and
scrapping
costs
,
is
estimated
at
approximately
$
2
billion
,
more
than
three
times
the
$
612
million
construction
cost
of

the
2010
austin
suicide
attack
occurred
on
february
18
,
2010
,
when
andrew
joseph
stack
iii
deliberately
crashed
his
single-engine
piper
dakota
light
aircraft
into
building
i
of
the
echelon
office
complex
in
austin
,
texas
,
united
states
,
killing
himself
and
internal
revenue
service
manager
vernon
hunter
.


Thirteen
others
were
injured
,
two
seriously
.


The
four-story
office
building
housed
an
IRS
field
office
occupying
the
top
three
floors
,
along
with
a
couple
of
private
businesses
on
the
first
floor
.


Prior
to
the
crash
,
Stack
had
posted
a
suicide
note
expressing
his
disillusionment
with
the
government
and
corporations
such
as
the
IRS
to
his
business
website
.


Stack
is
also
suspected
of
having
set
fire
that
morning
to
his
two-story
North
Austin
house
,
which
was
mostly
destroyed
.


In
the
aftermath
,
there
was
increased
debate
over
the
policies
of
the
IRS
,
and
different
forms
of
protest
.


In
response
to
the
attack
,
the
IRS
spent
more
than
$
38.6
million
,
with
$
6.4
million
spent
to
recover
and
resume
work
at
the
building
,
and
over
$
32
million
spent
to
increase
security
at
other
IRS
sites
in
the
U.S
.


However
,
the
spending
on
security
changes
was
questioned
as
being
ineffective
.


The
building
was
repaired
by
December
2011
.

Urbain
Le
Clerc
de
Juigné
,
governor
of
the
nearby
French-occupied
Castellfollit
de
la
Roca
,
and
16
companies
of
Catalan
``
miquelets
''
and
several
armed
peasants
at
the
orders
of
Ramon
de
Sala
i
Saçala
,
the
veguer
of
the
town
of
Vic
.


Juigné
's
force
was
in
a
punitive
expedition
to
burn
the
village
of
Sant
Esteve
d'en
Bas
,
whose
inhabitants
had
refused
to
pay
war
contributions
to
the
French
army
,
when
it
was
attacked
by
the
Catalan
militia
and
nearly
destroyed
in
two
separate
engagements
.


The
first
and
more
bloody
fight
took
place
at
the
wood
of
Malatosquera
and
the
bridge
of
Sant
Roc
,
where
the
French
lost
500
men
killed
or
wounded
.


Defeated
,
Juigné
and
his
remaining
troops
fled
to
Olot
,
where
they
entrenched
themselves
in
a
convent
.


The
Catalans
forced
the
French
to
surrender
by
setting
the
building
on
fire
.


At
the
slight
cost
of
7
men
killed
and
5
wounded
,
the
miquelets
and
peasants
under
Sala
i
Saçala
killed
260
French
soldiers
and
took
826
prisoners
.


Juigné
was
among
the
first
.


This
French
defeat
was
followed
,
just
a
month
later
,
by
the
blockade
by
Spanish
troops
,
``
miquelets
''
and
armed
peasants
,
of
the
French
garrisons
of
Castellfollit
and
Hostalric
,
which
the
French
command
decided
to
demolish
and
evacuate
on
July
under
the
impossibility
of
keeping
both
positions
.


Hurricane
Tina
was
the
strongest
and
longest-lived
storm
of
the
1992
Pacific
hurricane
season
,
which
also
threatened
land
for
a
brief
period
.


The
twenty-fourth
tropical
cyclone
,
twenty-second
tropical
storm
,
fourteenth
hurricane
,
and
eighth
major
hurricane
of
the
record
breaking
1992
season
,
Tina
formed
from
a
tropical
wave
on
September
17
.


The
storm
moved
towards
the
west
and
strengthened
into
a
hurricane
.


A
breakdown
in
a
ridge
and
to
the
north
and
a
trough
then
re-curved
Tina
to
the
northeast
and
towards
land
,
still
moving
slowly
and
gradually
slowing
down
.


The
trough
broke
down
and
was
replaced
by
a
strong
ridge
.


Tina
then
changed
direction
again
and
headed
out
to
sea
.


It
intensified
into
a
Category
4
storm
with
winds
of
150
mph
(
240
km/h
)
and
a
central
pressure
of
932
millibars
.


Tina
then
slowly
weakened
as
it
turned
to
the
north
.


Tropical
Depression
Tina
dissipated
on
October
11
,
shortly
after
entering
the
Central
Pacific
Hurricane
Center
's
area
of
responsibility
.


although
the
tropical
cyclone
never
made
landfall
,
heavy
rains
were
recorded
across
western
mexico
.


While
at
peak
intensity
,
the
storm
also
displayed
annular
characteristics
.


The
Cheshire
,
Connecticut
,
home
invasion
murders
occurred
on
July
23
,
2007
.


During
a
home
invasion
in
Cheshire
,
Connecticut
,
Jennifer
Hawke-Petit
and
her
11-year-old
and
17-year-old
daughters
were
raped
and
murdered
;
her
husband
,
Dr.
William
Petit
,
was
severely
injured
.


``
The
Hartford
Courant
''
referred
to
the
case
as
``
possibly
the
most
widely
publicized
crime
in
the
state
's
history
''
.


In
2010
,
Steven
Hayes
was
convicted
of
the
murders
and
sentenced
to
death
.


His
accomplice
,
Joshua
Komisarjevsky
,
was
found
guilty
on
October
13
,
2011
,
and
sentenced
to
death
on
January
27
,
2012
.


In
August
2015
,
the
Connecticut
Supreme
Court
,
in
defiance
of
the
State
Legislature
which
had
abolished
the
death
penalty
only
for
future
cases
,
ruled
that
the
death
penalty
was
unconstitutional
,
and
commuted
all
death
sentences
to
life-in-prison
,
even
if
that
sentencing
took
place
prior
to
the
date
that
the
death
penalty
was
abolished
.


The
2010–12
Algerian
protests
was
a
series
of
protests
taking
place
throughout
Algeria
,
lasting
from
28
December
2010
to
early
2012
.


The
protests
had
been
inspired
by
similar
protests
across
the
Middle
East
and
North
Africa
.


Causes
cited
by
the
protesters
included
unemployment
,
the
lack
of
housing
,
food-price
inflation
,
corruption
,
restrictions
on
freedom
of
speech
and
poor
living
conditions
.


While
localized
protests
were
already
commonplace
over
previous
years
,
extending
into
December
2010
,
an
unprecedented
wave
of
simultaneous
protests
and
riots
,
sparked
by
sudden
rises
in
staple
food
prices
,
erupted
all
over
the
country
starting
in
January
2011
.


These
were
quelled
by
government
measures
to
lower
food
prices
,
but
were
followed
by
a
wave
of
self-immolations
,
most
of
them
in
front
of
government
buildings
.


Opposition
parties
,
unions
,
and
human
rights
organisations
then
began
to
hold
weekly
demonstrations
,
despite
these
being
illegal
without
government
permission
under
the
ongoing
state
of
emergency
;
the
government
suppressed
these
demonstrations
as
far
as
possible
,
but
in
late
February
yielded
to
pressure
and
lifted
the
state
of
emergency
.


Meanwhile
,
protests
by
unemployed
youth
,
typically
citing
unemployment
,
``
hogra
''
(
oppression
)
,
and
infrastructure
problems
,
resumed
,
occurring
almost
daily
in
towns
scattered
all
over
the
country
.


The
Landing
at
Nassau
Bay
was
an
amphibious
landing
by
Allied
forces
at
Nassau
Bay
during
the
New
Guinea
campaign
of
World
War
II
that
took
place
between
30
June
and
6
July
1943
.


The
operation
was
undertaken
so
that
Allies
could
secure
a
beachhead
to
establish
a
supply
point
to
shorten
their
supply
lines
for
the
proposed
attack
on
Salamaua
as
part
of
the
Salamaua–Lae
campaign
and
resulted
in
a
battalion-sized
force
of
US
infantry
and
supporting
elements
being
landed
largely
unopposed
on
the
south-eastern
flank
of
the
battle
zone
.


Due
to
bad
weather
,
the
landing
force
suffered
heavy
equipment
losses
with
most
of
the
US
landing
craft
being
wrecked
in
heavy
seas
.


Nevertheless
,
the
US
troops
were
able
to
secure
a
lodgement
from
where
they
subsequently
broke
out
,
advancing
north
as
part
of
a
flanking
drive
on
Salamaua
,
which
was
launched
in
conjunction
with
attacks
by
Australian
forces
further
west
.


Australian
forces
also
provided
support
during
the
landing
,
marking
the
landing
beaches
,
and
providing
diversionary
attacks
against
nearby
Japanese
forces
.


The
landing
was
subsequently
exploited
with
two
more
US
infantry
battalions
being
landed
throughout
early
July
,
along
with
Australian
and
US
artillery
batteries
,
which
were
used
to
help
reduce
the
Japanese
positions
around
the
Salamaua
battle
zone
in
the
following
months
as
the
Allies
sought
to
draw
Japanese
reinforcements
away
from
Lae
.


The
Wars
of
the
Three
Kingdoms
,
sometimes
known
as
the
British
Civil
Wars
,
formed
an
intertwined
series
of
conflicts
that
took
place
in
the
kingdoms
of
England
,
Scotland
,
and
Ireland
between
1639
and
1651
.


The
English
Civil
War
proper
has
become
the
best-known
of
these
conflicts
;
it
included
the
abolition
of
the
monarchy
and
the
execution
of
the
kingdoms
'
monarch
,
Charles
I
,
by
the
English
Parliament
in
1649
.


The
history
of
these
wars
is
often
extended
to
include
the
uprisings
and
conflicts
that
continued
through
the
1650s
until
the
English
Restoration
of
the
monarchy
in
1660
,
and
sometimes
to
include
Venner
's
uprising
the
following
year
.


The
wars
were
the
outcome
of
broadly
set
tensions
over
religious
and
civil
issues
.


Religious
disputes
centred
on
whether
religion
was
to
be
dictated
by
the
monarch
or
by
choice
,
the
conscience
of
the
individual
,
with
many
people
feeling
that
they
ought
to
have
freedom
of
religion
(
freedom
of
conscience
)
.


The
related
civil
question
was
settling
the
extent
to
which
the
king
's
rule
was
to
be
constrained
by
Parliament—in
particular
the
right
to
raise
taxes
and
armed
forces
without
consent
of
the
Parliament
.


The
wars
also
had
elements
of
national
conflict
,
as
Ireland
and
Scotland
rebelled
against
England
's
primacy
within
the
Three
Kingdoms
.


The
broad
and
durable
victory
of
the
English
Parliament—ultimately
(
under
Oliver
Cromwell
and
the
Army
)
overcoming
the
king
,
the
Irish
and
the
Scots
,
and
then
outlasting
the
Cromwellian
Protectorate
itself—helped
establish
the
future
of
Great
Britain
and
Ireland
as
a
constitutional
monarchy
with
political
power
centred
on
the
Parliament
in
London
.


These
wars
included
the
Bishops
'
Wars
of
1639
and
1640
;
the
Irish
Rebellion
of
1641
;
Confederate
Ireland
,
1642–1649
;
the
Scottish
Civil
War
of
1644–1645
;
and
the
Cromwellian
conquest
of
Ireland
in
1649
(
collectively
the
Eleven
Years
War
or
Irish
Confederate
Wars
)
;
and
the
First
,
Second
and
Third
English
Civil
Wars
of
1642–1646
,
1648–1649
and
1650–1651
.


The
Attacks
on
High
Wood
near
Bazentin
le
Petit
in
the
Somme
``
département
''
of
northern
France
took
place
between
the
British
Fourth
Army
and
the
German
1st
Army
during
the
Battle
of
the
Somme
.


After
the
Battle
of
Bazentin
Ridge
on
14
July
1916
,
High
Wood
lay
undefended
for
most
of
the
day
but
delays
in
communication
and
confusion
caused
by
orders
and
counter-orders
from
British
corps
headquarters
,
which
had
overlapping
responsibilities
,
led
to
the
occupation
of
High
Wood
being
forestalled
by
German
reserves
,
which
had
moved
forward
to
counter-attack
British
troops
in
the
villages
of
Bazentin-le-Grand
and
Bazentin-le-Petit
.


Men
from
the
7th
Division
managed
to
occupy
the
southern
half
of
the
wood
and
two
cavalry
squadrons
advanced
on
the
east
side
to
Wood
Lane
,
which
connected
the
wood
to
Longueval
.


On
15
July
,
the
wood
was
evacuated
by
the
survivors
and
the
cavalry
retired
.


The
British
and
the
Germans
fought
for
control
of
the
wood
from
14
July
to
15
September
.


Both
sides
had
many
casualties
and
chronic
communication
problems
;
inclement
weather
grounded
aircraft
,
obscured
the
view
and
slowed
movement
on
the
roads
,
which
had
been
severely
bombarded
and
turned
to
mud
as
soon
as
it
rained
.


Trenches
and
shell
holes
filled
with
water
,
which
made
infantry
movement
exceedingly
difficult
and
exhausted
trench
garrisons
.


The
British
and
French
found
it
impossible
to
arrange
co-ordinated
attacks
and
fought
many
small
piecemeal
actions
,
rather
than
general
attacks
until
15
September
.


British-French
co-operation
broke
down
again
and
the
French
did
not
attack
on
15
September
,
when
the
British
captured
the
wood
during
the
Battle
of
Flers–Courcelette
(
15–22
September
)
.


The
German
defenders
had
great
difficulty
finding
fresh
troops
for
the
Somme
front
,
despite
ending
the
Battle
of
Verdun
and
had
to
send
divisions
to
the
Eastern
Front
and
to
Romania
after
it
declared
war
on
27
August
.


Turnover
of
German
divisions
was
high
and
many
had
to
be
withdrawn
and
replaced
after
fourteen
days
in
the
front
line
.


The
Germans
lacked
the
resources
to
make
many
big
organised
counter-attacks
and
those
at
High
Wood
and
the
vicinity
were
often
as
costly
and
ineffective
as
corresponding
British
attacks
.


Tropical
Cyclone
Haruna
was
a
deadly
storm
that
produced
widespread
flooding
and
a
disease
outbreak
in
southwestern
Madagascar
.


The
ninth
system
of
the
season
,
Haruna
developed
in
the
Mozambique
channel
in
the
middle
of
February
2013
between
Mozambique
and
southwestern
Madagascar
.


Initially
moving
northward
over
Mozambique
,
the
disturbance
later
moved
slowly
southward
,
gradually
strengthening
into
the
eighth
named
storm
of
the
season
and
later
into
an
intense
tropical
cyclone
.


The
Météo-France
office
in
Réunion
(
MFR
)
–
the
official
Regional
Specialized
Meteorological
Center
in
the
basin
–
estimated
the
cyclone
attained
peak
10
minute
sustained
winds
of
150
km/h
(
90
mph
)
.


Haruna
made
landfall
near
Morombe
in
southwestern
Madagascar
on
February
22
.


It
weakened
significantly
while
crossing
the
country
,
and
MFR
discontinued
advisories
on
February
24
after
the
storm
had
emerged
into
the
Indian
Ocean
.


Before
Haruna
struck
Madagascar
,
a
pre-existing
system
produced
deadly
flooding
,
and
when
the
cyclone
crossed
the
country
,
it
added
additional
rainfall
to
the
region
.


Flooding
was
worst
in
Toliara
where
a
dyke
burst
,
flooding
much
of
the
town
and
leaving
residents
without
water
or
power
.


Many
villages
in
southwestern
Madagascar
lost
access
to
clean
water
,
prompting
various
international
agencies
to
deploy
teams
to
decontaminate
wells
.


Haruna
destroyed
7,402
houses
,
which
left
13,882
people
homeless
.


Most
of
the
displaced
people
were
able
to
leave
their
shelters
by
early
April
.


The
cyclone
damaged
rice
and
maize
crops
along
the
coast
,
although
there
were
extended
residual
effects
when
a
locust
outbreak
occurred
,
affecting
half
of
Madagascar
's
farmlands
by
July
2013
.


Throughout
Madagascar
,
Haruna
killed
26
people
and
injured
127
directly
,
and
there
were
outbreaks
of
various
diseases
in
the
storm
's
aftermath
.


The
2011
Mexico
fire
season
is
the
fire
season
which
occurred
between
January
and
May
2011
.


Usually
during
May
,
the
first
wet-season
rains
begin
to
fall
,
followed
by
a
soggy
five
months
.


As
of
May
20
,
2011
,
the
fire
season
had
not
slowed
down
and
the
flames
continued
to
burn
forests
.


Fires
burned
throughout
the
country
,
casting
a
smoky
haze
from
the
Pacific
Ocean
to
the
Gulf
of
Mexico
.


2011
turned
out
to
be
an
extreme
fire
season
in
Mexico
.


By
May
19
,
more
than
530,000
hectares
(
1,300,000
acres
or
2,000
square
miles
)
of
land
had
burned
in
the
country
since
the
beginning
of
the
year
,
according
to
the
Mexican
government
.


In
terms
of
area
burned
,
2011
surpassed
every
year
since
(
and
including
)
1998
,
making
it
one
of
the
most
challenging
fire
seasons
for
30
years
.


The
2006
ASEAN
University
Games
officially
known
as
the
13th
ASEAN
University
Games
was
a
Southeast
Asian
university
multi-sports
event
held
in
Hanoi
,
Vietnam
from
16
to
22
December
2006
.


This
was
the
first
time
Vietnam
hosted
the
ASEAN
University
Games
.


Around
1000
athletes
participated
at
the
event
which
featured
157
events
in
12
sports
.


Vietnam
is
the
seventh
nation
to
host
the
ASEAN
University
Games
after
Thailand
,
Indonesia
,
Malaysia
,
Singapore
,
Brunei
and
the
Philippines
.


It
was
opened
by
Nguyen
Thien
Nhan
,
the
Minister
of
Education
and
Training
of
Vietnam
at
the
Hang
Day
Stadium
and
Quan
Ngua
Sports
Palace
respectively
.


The
final
medal
tally
was
led
by
host
Vietnam
,
followed
by
Thailand
and
Indonesia
.


Several
games
and
national
records
were
broken
during
the
games
.


The
games
were
deemed
generally
successful
with
the
rising
standards
of
university
sports
competition
amongst
the
Southeast
Asian
nations
.


The

refers
to
actions
in
the

,
both
of
which
are
in
the
Rutshuru
area
of

back
from
its
key
position
at
mount
unk
and
unk
,
north
of

.


Congo
also
re-captured
Kiwanja
and
Rutshuru
,
where
its
forces
discovered
mass
graves
.


On
30
October
,
Bunagana
,
the
first
town
seized
by
the
rebels
in
2012
,
was
stormed
by
UN-backed
Congolese
troops
as
the

.


Following
Uganda
's
calls
for
a
ceasefire
on
1
November
and
government
shelling
the
next
day
,
as
well
as
a
new
offensive
on
3
November
in
the
hills
around
the
border
with
Uganda
and
Rwanda
,
M23
leader
Bertrand
Bisimwa
called
to
``
immediately
end
hostilities
''
.


He
asked
for
the
facilitator
of
the
Kampala
peace
talks
``
to
immediately
put
in
place
a
mechanism
to
monitor
the
ceasefire
.
''


The
army
accused
the
rebels
of
bombing
Bunagana
.


Army
spokesman
Olivier
Hamuli
said
:
``
This
is
not
fighting
,
it
is
bombs
launched
by
M23
targeting
the
population
of
Bunagana
.


They
are
targeting
civilians
.
''


Conversely
,
the
rebels
said
that
they
were
attacked
with
heavy
weapons
.


``
Radio
Okapi
''
reported
that
four
civilians
were
killed
and
10
others
were
wounded
in
Bunagana
on
4
November
.


UN
,
EU
and
AU
envoys
urged
both
sides
not
to
undo
the
progress
made
in
peace
talks
,
saying
that
M23
should
renounce
its
rebellion
and
the
army
should
hold
off
from
further
military
action
.


The
next
day
,
following
the
two-week
UN-backed
offensive
,
the
government
claimed
to
have
defeated
the
rebels
.


M23
representatives
said
that
it
was
ending
its
rebellion
and
would
disarm
and
demobilise
its
forces
in
order
to
pursue
a
political
solution
.


The
announcement
came
hours
after
its
fighters
were
driven
out
of
its
last
two
strongholds
of
Tshanzu
and
Runyoni
at
about
3:00
.


Bisimiwa
issued
a
statement
that
read
:
``
The
chief
of
general
staff
and
the
commanders
of
all
major
units
are
requested
to
prepare

for
disarmament
,
demobilisation
and
reintegration
on
terms
to
be
agreed
with
the
government
of
Congo
.
''


Government
spokesman
Laurent
Mende
said
that
many
rebel
fighters
were
surrendering
and
that
Congo
was
ready
to
pursue
peace
talks
.


The
U.S.
special
envoy
for
the
African
Great
Lakes
region
said
from
Pretoria
:
``
In
a
region
that
has
suffered
so
much
,
this
is
obviously
a
significant
positive
step
in
the
right
direction

''


On
6
November
2013
,
the
March
23
rebels
fled
the
country
.


The
next
day
,
the
rebels
surrendered
at
Mgahinga
Gorilla
National
Park
in
Uganda
Another
1,500
fighters
,
believed
to
be
most
of
the
force
,
were
held
after
surrendering
in
Kisoro
by
the
borders
;
they
included
Sultani
Makenga
.


at
a
meeting
in
entebbe
,
uganda
,
the
congolese
government
delegation
left
the
talks
after
a
failure
to
agree
to
a
wording
of
a
document
intended
to
officially
end
the
insurgency
.


Government
spokesman
Lambert
Mende
said
:
``
Uganda
seems
now
to
be
acting
as
part
of
the
conflict
.


It
has
interests
in
M23

The
1999
Odisha
cyclone
(
IMD
designation
BOB
06
,
JTWC
designation
05B
)
was
the
most
intense
recorded
tropical
cyclone
in
the
North
Indian
Ocean
and
among
the
most
destructive
in
the
region
.


The
1999
Odisha
cyclone
organized
into
a
tropical
depression
in
the
Andaman
Sea
on
25
October
,
though
its
origins
could
be
traced
back
to
an
area
of
convection
in
the
Sulu
Sea
four
days
prior
.


The
disturbance
gradually
strengthened
as
it
took
a
west-northwesterly
path
,
reaching
cyclonic
storm
strength
the
next
day
.


Aided
by
highly
favorable
conditions
,
the
storm
rapidly
intensified
,
attaining
super
cyclonic
storm
intensity
on
28
October
,
before
peaking
on
the
next
day
with
winds
of
260
km/h
(
160
mph
)
and
a
record-low
pressure
of
912
mbar
(
hPa
;
26.93
inHg
)
.


The
storm
maintained
this
intensity
as
it
made
landfall
on
Odisha
on
29
October
.


The
cyclone
steadily
weakened
due
to
persistent
land
interaction
and
dry
air
,
remaining
quasi-stationary
for
two
days
before
slowly
drifting
offshore
as
a
much
weaker
system
;
the
storm
dissipated
on
4
November
over
the
Bay
of
Bengal
.


although
its
primary
effects
were
felt
in
a
localized
area
of
india
,
the
outer
fringes
of
the
super
cyclone
impacted
myanmar
and
bangladesh
.


Ten
people
were
killed
in
the
former
,
while
two
were
killed
in
the
latter
by
the
storm
's
rainbands
.


The
storm
was
the
most
severe
to
strike
Odisha
in
the
20th
century
,
raking
the
state
and
adjacent
areas
with
high
storm
surge
,
powerful
winds
,
and
torrential
rainfall
.


The
storm
's
impacts
exacerbated
the
damage
caused
by
a
very
severe
cyclone
that
struck
the
same
region
less
than
two
weeks
earlier
.


The
5–6
m
(
16–20
ft
)
surge
brought
water
up
to
35
km
(
20
mi
)
inland
,
carrying
along
with
it
coastal
debris
and
inundating
towns
and
villages
.


The
surge
combined
with
heavy
rains
to
produce
widespread
flooding
,
damaging
around
1.6
million
homes
and
causing
rivers
to
breach
20,005
flood
embankments
.


The
storm
's
effects
destroyed
numerous
crops
,
including
sugar
cane
,
rice
,
and
other
winter-time
harvests
.


although
estimates
of
the
death
toll
varied
unk
times
suggesting
30,000
unk
government
of
india
enumerated
unk
fatalities
in
the
country
,
of
which
a
majority
were
caused
by
storm
surge
;
over
8,000
deaths
occurred
in
jagatsinghpur
.


The
total
damage
cost
of
the
destruction
wrought
by
the
super
cyclone
amounted
to
US
$
4.44
billion
.


Recovery
efforts
were
extensive
following
the
storm
's
passage
.


The
Government
of
India
allocated
₹3
billion
(
US
$
69.3
million
)
to
the
Odisha
state
government
,
supplementing
earlier
contributions
made
towards
relief
from
the
earlier
cyclone
.


various
branches
of
the
indian
armed
forces
were
dispatched
to
aid
the
recovery
efforts
.


Contributions
from
foreign
governments
amounted
to
nearly
US
$
13
million
,
with
more
than
half
allocated
by
the
United
States
.


Alongside
foreign
and
domestic

Hurricane
Paul
was
a
strong
tropical
cyclone
that
threatened
the
Baja
California
peninsula
during
October
2012
.


The
sixteenth
tropical
cyclone
,
tenth
hurricane
,
and
fifth
major
hurricane
of
the
season
,
Paul
originated
from
a
trough
of
low
pressure
west
of
the
coastline
of
Mexico
on
October
13
.


While
turning
towards
the
north
,
the
system
quickly
organized
,
reaching
hurricane
status
on
the
afternoon
of
October
15
.


By
that
afternoon
,
Paul
had
reached
its
peak
intensity
as
a
Category
3
hurricane
on
the
Saffir-Simpson
hurricane
wind
scale
(
SSHWS
)
with
maximum
sustained
winds
of
120
mph
(
195
km/h
)
,
but
began
to
weaken
rapidly
thereafter
due
to
land
interaction
and
strong
wind
shear
.


Late
on
October
17
,
Paul
degenerated
into
a
remnant
low
.


The
remnants
of
Paul
later
moved
ashore
along
the
central
Baja
California
Peninsula
.


Prior
to
the
storm
's
arrival
in
Baja
California
Sur
,
hurricane
watches
and
warnings
were
issued
for
coastal
locations
.


Hundreds
of
homes
were
damaged
across
the
region
and
damage
to
infrastructure
was
significant
.


Power
outages
also
occurred
across
the
region
as
a
result
of
Hurricane
Paul
.


A
total
of
400
homes
were
destroyed
,
and
300
others
were
flooded
.


Damage
totaled
$
15.5

The
air
battle
over
Niš
occurred
on
7
November
1944
over
Niš
,
in
Serbia
,
between
the
Air
Forces
of
the
United
States
and
the
Soviet
Union
in
World
War
II
due
to
both
countries
mistaking
the
other
for
Germans
.


This
was
only
one
of
two
direct
military
confrontations
between
the
U.S.
and
the
USSR
in
the
history
of
these
two
countries
,
the
other
being
the
attack
on
the
Sui-ho
Dam
taking
place
during
the
1950–1953
Korean
war
.


After
the
successful
joint
offensive
in
October
1944
and
the
expulsion
of
German
forces
to
the
north
,
the
military
units
of
the
Red
Army
had
been
ordered
to
follow
in
their
steps
.


On
7
November
,
a
long
column
of
vehicles
belonging
to
6th
Guards
Rifle
Corps
of
the
Red
Army
was
moving
from
Niš
towards
Belgrade
,
with
orders
to
reinforce
the
southern
wing
of
the
Hungarian
front
.


Suddenly
,
at
about
10
AM
,
from
southeast
over
the
Jastrebac
mountain
,
three
groups
of
American
P-38
Lightning
fighter
planes
arrived
and
the
first
group
immediately
started
to
strafe
the
leading
vehicles
,
destroying
several
,
with
31
killed
and
37
wounded
.


The
commander
of
the
corps
,
Lieutenant
General
Grigory
Petrovich
Kotov
,
was
also
killed
in
this
attack
.


while
the
second
group
of
us
p-38
planes
were
starting
their
attack
,
the
commander
of
the
17th
air
army
,
general
unk
,
who
was
at
the
UNK
airbase
at
the
time
,
issued
an
order
for
immediate
takeoff
to
the
pilots
on
duty
flying
yakovlev
unk
fighters
from
unk
regiment
of
288th
air
division
based
at
UNK
,
believing
they
were
being
attacked
by
german
focke-wulf
fw
189
fighters
.


The
American
planes
shifted
their
fire
to
the
Soviet
fighters
which
were
taking
off
in
spite
of
clearly
visible
large
red
star
markings
on
their
wings
.


One
of
the
Yak-3s
was
destroyed
right
away
.


The
P-38s
then
climbed
to
about
500m
and
formed
a
defensive
circle
above
the
city
of
Niš
itself
,
waiting
to
see
how
this
uncertain
situation
would
be
resolved
.


According
to
aeronautical
engineer
Dragoslav
Dimić
,
who
as
a
child
was
among
the
gathered
inhabitants
of
Niš
,
the
remaining
Soviet
fighters
flew
over
the
old
city
fortress
at
an
altitude
of
only
20m
and
attacked
the
Lightnings
from
below
in
a
steep
climb
.


One
Lightning
burst
into
flames
and
fell
to
the
ground
near
the
airstrip
of
the
Niš
airbase
.


The
Yaks
flew
through
the
circling
Lightnings
and
attacked
them
again
,
this
time
from
above
.


One
of
the
Yaks
was
hit
by
American
fire
and
fell
to
the
ground
.


Soon
the
battle
was
joined
by
a
second
group
of
Yaks
led
by
a
famous
Soviet
fighter
ace
Captain
Koldunov
,
who
took
off
from
another
airbase
near
Niš
.


The
'tangle
of
death
'
that
formed
in
the
air
moved
westward
across
the
city
with
the
sound
of
machine
gun
and
cannon
fire
.


9
Soviet
Yak-3
and
an
unidentified
number
of
US
P-38
fighters
participated
in
the
battle
which
lasted
for
about
another
15
minutes
.


According
to
American
author
Glenn
Bows
,
4
Yaks
and
2
Lightnings
were
lost
,
while
Russian
sources
state
that
3
Yaks
and
4
P-38s
had
been
destroyed
.


Joko
Drecun
,
a
partisan
officer
who
was
based
at
Niš
airport
at
the
time
wrote
in
his
diary
that
the
Americans
lost
7
planes
and
the
Soviets
lost
3
planes
.


The
United
States
apologized
to
the
Soviet
Union
,
stating
that
the
attack
was
the
result
of
a
grave
error
by
American
pilots
sent
to
attack
German
forces
on
the
road
from
Skopje
to
Pristina
.


On
14
December
,
American
Ambassador
to
the
Soviet
Union
W.
Averell
Harriman
apologized
on
behalf
of
Franklin
D.
Roosevelt
and
George
C.
Marshall
and
offered
to
send
liaison
officers
to
the
3rd
Ukrainian
Front
to
prevent
further
incidents
;
Stalin
rejected
it
,
because
a
line
of
demarcation
had
been
drawn
indicating
the
boundaries
of
Allied
air
actions
.


tropical
storm
felice
was
a
modest
tropical
cyclone
that
lightly
affected
parts
of
the
gulf
coast
of
the
united
states
in
mid-september
1970
.


Spawned
by
an
upper-level
trough
over
the
Bahamas
,
the
system
crossed
the
Florida
Keys
and
entered
the
Gulf
of
Mexico
,
where
it
gradually
began
to
strengthen
.


Felice
was
a
disorganized
storm
for
its
entire
duration
,
plagued
by
dry
air
,
a
lack
of
deep
thunderstorm
activity
,
and
an
ill-defined
center
of
circulation
,
but
nevertheless
managed
to
peak
as
a
high-end
tropical
storm
with
winds
just
below
Category
1
hurricane
strength
.


Tracking
northwestward
,
the
storm
brushed
southern
Louisiana
on
September
15
before
making
landfall
northeast
of
Galveston
,
Texas
,
late
that
same
day
.


Once
ashore
,
Felice
quickly
deteriorated
as
it
recurved
into
the
central
United
States
.


While
over
southeastern
Oklahoma
,
however
,
its
remnants
still
closely
resembled
a
formidable
tropical
cyclone
.


In
advance
of
the
cyclone
,
officials
prompted
residents
in
vulnerable
communities
to
leave
their
homes
,
and
temporary
storm
shelters
were
established
.


However
,
the
effects
from
Felice
were
generally
light
.


Beneficial
rains
fell
over
parts
of
southern
Florida
,
while
sections
of
coastal
Louisiana
experienced
minimal
gale-force
winds
and
above-normal
tides
.


Winds
gusting
to
at
Galveston—and
estimated
near
70
mph
(
110
km/h
)
elsewhere—caused
scattered
power
outages
and
minor
tree
damage
,
while
heavy
rainfall
totaling
over
triggered
some
street
flooding
.


Felice
delayed
the
local
rice
harvest
and
damaged
some
hay
that
had
been
cut
before
the
storm
.


Significant
precipitation
and
gusty
winds
accompanied
the
system
into
northern
Texas
and
Oklahoma
.


Overall
,
the
storm
left
no
fatalities
or
widespread
property
damage
anywhere
along
its
path
.


the
great
galveston
hurricane
,
known
regionally
as
the
great
storm
of
1900
,
was
the
deadliest
natural
disaster
in
united
states
history
,
one
of
the
deadliest
hurricanes
(
or
remnants
)
to
affect
canada
,
and
the
unk
atlantic
hurricane
overall
.


The
hurricane
left
between
6,000
and
12,000
fatalities
in
the
United
States
;
the
number
most
cited
in
official
reports
is
8,000
.


Most
of
these
deaths
occurred
in
and
near
Galveston
,
Texas
,
after
storm
surge
inundated
the
coastline
with
8
to
12
ft
(
2.4
to
3.7
m
)
of
water
.


In
addition
to
the
number
killed
,
the
storm
destroyed
about
7,000
buildings
of
all
uses
in
Galveston
,
which
included
3,636
destroyed
homes
;
every
dwelling
in
the
city
suffered
some
degree
of
damage
.


The
hurricane
left
approximately
10,000
people
in
the
city
homeless
,
out
of
a
total
population
of
nearly

.


The
disaster
ended
the
Golden
Era
of
Galveston
,
as
the
hurricane
alarmed
potential
investors
,
who
turned
to
Houston
instead
.


In
response
to
the
storm
,
three
engineers
designed
and
oversaw
plans
to
raise
the
Gulf
of
Mexico
shoreline
of
Galveston
island
by
and
erect
a
seawall
.


On
August
27
,
1900
,
a
ship
east
of
the
Windward
Islands
detected
a
tropical
cyclone
,
the
first
observed
during
the
annual
season
.


Initially
at
tropical
storm
status
,
it
remained
mostly
stagnant
in
intensity
while
moving
steadily
west-northwestward
and
entered
the
northeastern
Caribbean
Sea
on
August
30
.


The
storm
made
landfall
in
the
Dominican
Republic
as
a
weak
tropical
storm
on
September
2
.


It
weakened
slightly
while
crossing
Hispaniola
,
before
re-emerging
into
the
Caribbean
Sea
later
that
day
.


On
September
3
,
the
cyclone
struck
modern
day
Santiago
de
Cuba
Province
and
then
slowly
drifted
along
the
southern
coast
of
Cuba
.


upon
reaching
the
gulf
of
mexico
on
september
6
,
the
storm
strengthened
into
a
hurricane
.


Significant
intensification
followed
and
the
system
peaked
as
a
Category
4
hurricane
with
maximum
sustained
winds
of
145
mph
(
230
km/h
)
on
September
8
.


Early
on
the
next
day
,
it
made
landfall
to
the
south
of
Houston
,
Texas
.


The
cyclone
weakened
quickly
after
moving
inland
and
fell
to
tropical
storm
intensity
late
on
September
9
.


The
storm
turned
east-northeastward
and
became
extratropical
over
Iowa
on
September
11
.


The
extratropical
system
strengthened
while
accelerating
across
the
Midwestern
United
States
,
New
England
,
and
Eastern
Canada
before
reaching
the
Gulf
of
Saint
Lawrence
on
September
13
.


After
striking
Newfoundland
later
that
day
,
the
extratropical
storm
entered
the
far
North
Atlantic
Ocean
and
weakened
,
with
the
remnants
last
observed
near
Iceland
on
September
15
.


The
great
storm
brought
flooding
and
severe
thunderstorms
to
portions
of
the
Caribbean
,
especially
Cuba
and
Jamaica
.


It
is
likely
that
much
of
South
Florida
experienced
tropical
storm-force
winds
,
though
mostly
minor
damage
occurred
.


Hurricane-force
winds
and
storm
surge
inundated
portions
of
southern
Louisiana
,
though
the
cyclone
left
no
significant
structural
damage
or
fatalities
in
the
state
.


The
hurricane
brought
strong
winds
and
storm
surge
to
a
large
portion
of
east
Texas
,
with
Galveston
suffering
the
brunt
of
the
impact
.


Farther
north
,
the
storm
and
its
remnants
continued
to
produce
heavy
rains
and
gusty
winds
,
which
downed
telegraph
wires
,
signs
,
and
trees
in
several
states
.


Fatalities
occurred
in
other
states
,
including
fifteen
in
Ohio
,
six
in
Wisconsin
,
two
in
Illinois
,
two
in
New
York
,
one
in
Massachusetts
,
and
one
in
Missouri
.


Damage
from
the
storm
throughout
the
United
States
exceeded
$
34
million
.


The
remnants
also
brought
severe
impact
to
Canada
.


In
Ontario
,
damage
reached
about
$
1.35
million
,
with
$
1
million
to
crops
.


The
remnants
of
the
hurricane
caused
at
least
52
deaths
–
and
possibly
as
many
as
232
deaths
–
in
Canada
,
mostly
due
to
sunken
vessels
near
Newfoundland
and
the
French
territory
of
Saint-Pierre
.


Throughout
its
path
,
the
storm
caused
more
than
$
35.4
million
in
damage
.


the
march
on

,
the
march
on

great
march
on
washington
,
was
held
in
washington
,
d.c.
on
wednesday
,
august
28
,
1963
.


The
purpose
of
the
march
was
to
advocate
for
the
civil
and
economic
rights
of
African
Americans
.


at
the
march
,
martin
luther
king
jr.
,
standing
in
front
of
the
lincoln
memorial
,
delivered
his
historic
``
i
have
a
dream
''
speech
in
which
he
called
for
an
end
to
racism
.


The
march
was
organized
by
A.
Philip
Randolph
and
Bayard
Rustin
,
who
built
an
alliance
of
civil
rights
,
labor
,
and
religious
organizations
that
came
together
under
the
banner
of
``
jobs
and
freedom
.
''


Estimates
of
the
number
of
participants
varied
from
200,000
to
300,000
;
the
most
widely
cited
estimate
is
250,000
people
.


Observers
estimated
that
75–80
%
of
the
marchers
were
black
.


The
march
was
one
of
the
largest
political
rallies
for
human
rights
in
United
States
history
.


The
march
is
credited
with
helping
to
pass
the
Civil
Rights
Act
of
1964
and
preceded
the
Selma
Voting
Rights
Movement
which
led
to
the
passage
of
the
Voting
Rights
Act
of
1965

in
which
the

was
begun
from

The
Clone
Wars
,
occasionally
referred
to
in
the
singular
as
the
Clone
War
,
are
conflicts
in
the
``
Star
Wars
''
franchise
by
George
Lucas
.


though
mentioned
briefly
in
the
first
``
star
wars
''
film
(
1977
)
,
the
conflicts
themselves
are
not
depicted
until
'
(
2002
)
and
'
(
2005
)
.


The
Clone
Wars
are
also
the
setting
for
three
eponymous
projects
:
(
2003–2005
)
,
(
2008
)
,
and
(
2008–2014
)
.


They
have
featured
in
numerous
``
Star
Wars
''
books
and
games
.


Within
the
``
Star
Wars
''
narrative
,
the
Clone
Wars
involve
a
three-year
war
fought
to
prevent
thousands
of
planetary
systems
from
seceding
from
the
Galactic
Republic
and
forming
the
``
Confederacy
of
Independent
Systems
,
''
often
referred
to
as
``
the
Separatists
,
''
or
the
``
CIS
.
''


The
Republic
uses
an
army
of
clone
troopers
,
the
namesake
of
the
conflict
,
led
by
the
Jedi
Order
against
the
Separatist
battle
droid
army
.


The
conflict
was
manufactured
as
a
scheme
for
the
Republic
's
Supreme
Chancellor
Palpatine
,
secretly
an
evil
Sith
Lord
,
to
gain
power
and
ultimately
to
convert
the
democratic
Galactic
Republic
into
the
autocratic
Galactic
Empire
,
which
was
controlled
through
means
of
a
military-industrial
complex
and
featured
in
the
original
trilogy
.


Lucas
used
the
Clone
Wars
narrative
to
answer
questions
about
the
original
trilogy
,
such
as
how
the
Empire
originated
and
how
Anakin
Skywalker
became
Darth
Vader
.


The
political
and
military
events
of
the
Clone
Wars
draw
inspiration
from
real-world
conflicts
and
historical
events
,
such
as
World
War
II
and
Adolf
Hitler
's
rise
to
power
,
and
show
similarities
with
the
American
Civil
War
.


The
2012
Nuevo
Laredo
massacres
were
a
series
of
mass
murder
attacks
between
the
allied
Sinaloa
Cartel
and
Gulf
Cartel
against
Los
Zetas
in
the
border
city
of
Nuevo
Laredo
,
Tamaulipas
,
across
the
U.S.-Mexico
border
from
Laredo
,
Texas
.


The
drug-violence
in
Nuevo
Laredo
began
back
in
2003
,
when
the
city
was
controlled
by
the
Gulf
Cartel
.


Most
media
reports
that
write
about
the
Mexican
Drug
War
,
however
,
point
to
2006
as
the
start
of
the
drug
war
.


That
year
is
a
convenient
historical
marker
because
that
's
when
Felipe
Calderón
took
office
and
carried
out
an
aggressive
approach
against
the
cartels
.


But
authors
like
Ioan
Grillo
and
Sylvia
Longmire
note
that
Mexico
's
drug
war
actually
began
at
the
end
of
Vicente
Fox
's
administration
in
2004
,
when
the
first
major
battle
took
place
in
Nuevo
Laredo
between
the
Sinaloa
Cartel
and
Los
Zetas
,
who
at
that
time
worked
as
the
armed
wing
of
the
Gulf
Cartel
.


When
Osiel
Cárdenas
Guillén
,
the
former
leader
of
the
Gulf
Cartel
,
was
arrested
in
2003
,
the
Sinaloa
Cartel
,
sensing
weakness
,
tried
to
move
in
on
Nuevo
Laredo
,
unleashing
a
bloody
battle
.


Los
Zetas
,
however
,
were
successful
in
expelling
the
Sinaloa
organization
out
of
Nuevo
Laredo
,
and
have
ruled
the
city
``
with
fear
''
ever
since
.


Nevertheless
,
the
Gulf
cartel
and
Los
Zetas
broke
relations
in
early
2010
,
worsening
the
violence
across
northeast
Mexico
.


The
cartels
are
fighting
for
control
of
the
corridor
in
Nuevo
Laredo
that
leads
into
Interstate
35
,
one
of
the
most
lucrative
routes
for
drug
traffickers
.


Nuevo
Laredo
is
a
lucrative
drug
corridor
because
of
the
large
volume
of
trucks
that
pass
through
the
area
,
and
the
multiple
(
exploitable
)
ports
of
entry
.


over
40
%
of
all
cargo
crossings
from
mexico
to
the
united
states
crosses
through
the
border
checkpoints
in
nuevo
laredo
.


It
is
for
the
same
reason
that
Tijuana
and
Ciudad
Juárez
are
so
valuable
for
the
drug
trafficking
organizations
.

The
2001
Grand
National
(
known
as
the
Martell
Grand
National
for
sponsorship
reasons
)
was
the
154th
official
running
of
the
Grand
National
horse
race
that
took
place
at
Aintree
Racecourse
near
Liverpool
,
England
,
on
7
April
2001
.


The
steeplechase
was
won
by
a
distance
by
33/1
shot
Red
Marauder
,
ridden
by
jockey
Richard
Guest
,
in
a
time
of
over
11
minutes
.


The
winner
was
also
trained
by
his
jockey
and
owned
by
Norman
Mason
,
in
whose
name
the
training
licence
was
held
,
with
Guest
as
his
assistant
,
though
Guest
did
all
the
training
at
his
base
in
Crook
,
County
Durham
and
ran
in
the
trainer
's
colours
of
red
with
a
blue
hoop
,
three
blue
hoops
on
the
sleeves
and
a
red
and
blue
hooped
cap
.


The
field
was
limited
to
a
maximum
of
40
competitors
,
of
which
only
two
completed
the
course
without
mishap
(
two
others
were
re-mounted
to
complete
)
and
the
race
was
run
in
heavy
going
.


It
was
notable
for
an
unusually
high
number
of
falls
,
including
eight
at
the
first
Canal
Turn
,
and
it
came
in
for
criticism
in
some
quarters
,
believing
that
the
conditions
were
too
wet
and
muddy
.


However
,
supporters
of
the
race
were
quick
to
point
out
that
the
slow
pace
and
bottomless
ground
benefitted
the
race
as
there
were
no
injuries
sustained
to
any
horse
or
rider
.

unk
offensive
was
subsequently
launched
on
october

.


It
became
the
integral
part
of
the
war
in
Western
fronts
which
led
the
encirclement
and
destruction
of
Taliban
forces
in
the
region
,
although
the
Taliban
leadership
escaped
to
lawless
areas
of
neighboring
Afghanistan
.


The
operation
was
aimed
to
finish
the
senior
Taliban
leadership
and
bring
the
lawless
areas
back
to
government
control
,
however
the
leadership
escaped
to
Afghanistan

''
,
and
had
applied
a
successful

2017
ICC
World
Cricket
League
Division
Three
was
a
cricket
tournament
that
took
place
in
Uganda
between
23
and
30
May
2017
.


The
matches
took
place
in
Lugogo
,
Kyambogo
and
Entebbe
.


The
top
two
teams
,
Oman
and
Canada
,
were
promoted
to
Division
Two
.


The
final
ended
as
a
no
result
due
to
rain
,
and
therefore
Oman
won
the
tournament
by
virtue
of
finishing
top
of
the
group

table
.


Three
countries
bid
to
host
the
tournament
–
Canada
,
Malaysia

In
October
2016
,
the
International
Cricket

)
approved
a
proposal
for
the
tournament
to
be
held
in
Uganda
,
subject
to
security
arrangements
and

Project
Mohole
was
an
attempt
in
the
early
1960s
to
drill
through
the
Earth
's
crust
to
obtain
samples
of
the
Mohorovičić
discontinuity
,
or
Moho
,
the
boundary
between
the
Earth
's
crust
and
mantle
.


the
project
was
to
provide
an
earth
science
complement
to
the
high-profile
space
race
.


While
such
a
project
was
not
feasible
on
land
,
drilling
in
the
open
ocean
would
be
more
feasible
,
because
the
mantle
is
much
closer
to
the
sea
floor
.


the
project
was
initially
led
by
a
group
of
scientists
called
the
american
miscellaneous
society
with
funding
from
the
national
science
foundation
.


the
project
suffered
from
political
and
scientific
battles
,
mismanagement
,
and
cost
unk
,
and
the
u.s.
house
of
representatives
discontinued
funding
for
the
project
in
1966
.


by
then
a
program
of
sediment
drilling
had
branched
from
project
unk
to
become
the
deep
sea
drilling
project
of
the
national
science
foundation
.


The
2012
Riyadh
truck
crash
occurred
on
1
November
2012
,
when
a
truck
carrying
fuel
crashed
into
an
intersection
flyover
in
the
east
of
Riyadh
,
the
capital
city
of
Saudi
Arabia
.


The
lorry
hit
a
bridge
pylon
on
Khureis
Road
and
the
petrol
it
was
carrying
leaked
into
the
surroundings
,
and
then
ignited
.


Al
Ekhbariya
television
reported
that
the
blast
killed
23
people
outright
and
injured
111
,
with
the
death
toll
expected
to
rise
even
higher
;
although
the
Saudi
health
ministry
reported
the
injury
total
was
closer
to
135
.


An
Agence
France-Presse
photographer
on
the
scene
described
widespread
damage
,
with
charred
bodies
and
machinery
being
hauled
from
the
wreckage
.


Due
to
the
force
of
the
blast
,
another
truck
fell
off
of
the
flyover
.


Amateur
video
showed
black
smoke
billowing
into
the
sky
,
visible
throughout
the
city
.


The
scene
of
the
crash
was
within
close
vicinity
of
Prince
Nayef
Arab
University
for
Security
Studies
,
as
well
as
the
headquarters
of
the
Saudi
Arabian
National
Guard
,
thus
instigating
the
speculation
of
terrorist
collusion
or
perpetration
.


However
,
a
police
spokesman
stated
that
this
was
inexorably
not
the
case
,
explaining
``
the
truck
driver
was
surprised
by
a
road
accident
on
its
route
,
causing
it
to
crash
into
one
of
the
pillars
of
the
bridge
''
.


The
police
also
posited
that
due
to
it
being
the
Eid
al-Adha
holiday
,
the
casualty
total
was
significantly
less
than
it
would
have
been
during
a
normal
day
,
because
of
vastly
reduced
traffic
.


The
Riyadh
Police
also
warned
against
congregating
near
the
scene
of
the
crash
,
as
roughly
10,000
people
took
to
doing
just
an
hour
after
the
accident
occurred
.


On
2
November
,
the
Saudi
health
ministry
stated
that
the
death
toll
was
confirmed
to
have
risen
to
26
through
the
night
,
including
both
Saudis
,
Filipinos
(
the
lorry
driver
's
nationality
)
,
and
victims
of
other
nationalities
.


The
crash
is
expected
to
cost
upwards
of
300
million
riyals
.


According
to
Saudi
Minister
of
Health
Abdullah
bin
Abdulaziz
Al
Rabiah
,
90
of
the
injured
have
been
released
from
the
hospital
,
but
43
are
still
under
intensive
medical
care
.


The
driver
was
arrested
,
but
the
charges
against
him
are
unknown
.


The
Third
Battle
of
Kharkov
was
a
series
of
battles
on
the
Eastern
Front
of
World
War
II
,
undertaken
by
the
German
Army
Group
South
against
the
Red
Army
,
around
the
city
of
Kharkov
(
or
``
Kharkiv
''
)
between
19
February
and
15
March
1943
.


Known
to
the
German
side
as
the
Donets
Campaign
,
and
in
the
Soviet
Union
as
the
Donbas
and
Kharkov
operations
,
the
German
counterstrike
led
to
the
recapture
of
the
cities
of
Kharkov
and
Belgorod
.


As
the
German
Sixth
Army
was
encircled
in
Stalingrad
,
the
Red
Army
undertook
a
series
of
wider
attacks
against
the
rest
of
Army
Group
South
.


These
culminated
on
2
January
1943
when
the
Red
Army
launched
Operation
Star
and
Operation
Gallop
,
which
between
January
and
early
February
broke
German
defenses
and
led
to
the
Soviet
recapture
of
Kharkov
,
Belgorod
,
Kursk
,
as
well
as
Voroshilovgrad
and
Izium
.


The
Soviet
victories
caused
participating
Soviet
units
to
over-extend
themselves
,
though
this
was
largely
due
to
Manstein
's
strategy
of
controlled
retreat
towards
the
Dneiper
.


Freed
on
2
February
by
the
surrender
of
the
German
Sixth
Army
,
the
Red
Army
's
Central
Front
turned
its
attention
west
and
on
25
February
expanded
its
offensive
against
both
Army
Group
South
and
Army
Group
Center
.


Months
of
continuous
operations
had
taken
a
heavy
toll
on
the
Soviet
forces
and
some
divisions
were
reduced
to
1,000–2,000
combat
effective
soldiers
.


On
19
February
,
Field
Marshal
Erich
von
Manstein
launched
his
Kharkov
counterstrike
,
using
the
fresh
II
SS
Panzer
Corps
and
two
panzer
armies
.


manstein
benefited
greatly
from
the
massive
air
support
of
field
marshal
wolfram
von
richthofen
's
luftflotte
4
,
whose
1,214
aircraft
flew
over
1,000
sorties
per
day
from
20
february
to
15
march
to
support
the
german
army
,
a
level
of
airpower
equal
to
that
during
the
case
blue
strategic
offensive
a
year
earlier
.


The
Wehrmacht
flanked
,
encircled
,
and
defeated
the
Red
Army
's
armored
spearheads
south
of
Kharkov
.


This
enabled
Manstein
to
renew
his
offensive
against
the
city
of
Kharkov
proper
on
7
March
.


Despite
orders
to
encircle
Kharkov
from
the
north
,
the
SS
Panzer
Corps
instead
decided
to
directly
engage
Kharkov
on
11
March
.


This
led
to
four
days
of
house-to-house
fighting
before
Kharkov
was
recaptured
by
the
1st
SS
Panzer
Division
on
15
March
.


The
German
forces
recaptured
Belgorod
two
days
later
,
creating
the
salient
which
in
July
1943
would
lead
to
the
Battle
of
Kursk
.


The
German
offensive
cost
the
Red
Army
an
estimated
90,000
casualties
.


The
house-to-house
fighting
in
Kharkov
was
also
particularly
bloody
for
the
German
SS
Panzer
Corps
,
which
had
suffered
approximately
4,300
men
killed
and
wounded
by
the
time
operations
ended
in
mid-March
.


Severe
Tropical
Cyclone
Orson
was
the
fourth
most
intense
cyclone
ever
recorded
in
the
Australian
region
.


Forming
out
of
a
tropical
low
on
17
April
1989
,
Orson
gradually
intensified
as
it
tracked
towards
the
west
.


After
attaining
Category
5
intensity
on
20
April
,
the
storm
began
to
track
southward
and
accelerated
.


The
following
day
,
the
cyclone
reached
its
peak
intensity
with
winds
of
250
km/h
(
155
mph
)
and
a
barometric
pressure
of
904
hPa
(
mbar
)
.


Orson
maintained
this
intensity
for
nearly
two
days
before
making
landfall
near
Dampier
.


The
cyclone
rapidly
weakened
after
landfall
as
it
accelerated
to
the
southeast
.


After
moving
into
the
Great
Australian
Bight
on
24
April
,
the
storm
dissipated
.


Despite
Orson
's
extreme
intensity
,
damage
was
relatively
minimal
as
it
struck
a
sparsely
populated
region
of
Western
Australia
.


Five
people
were
killed
offshore
and
damages
amounted
to
(
)
.


The
storm
damaged
a
new
gas
platform
that
explored
a
possible
oil
field
,
believed
to
contain
nearly
of
oil
.


The
damage
delayed
the
project
for
nearly
two
weeks
.


The
most
severe
impacts
took
place
in
Pannawonica
,
where
70
homes
were
damaged
.


Following
the
storm
,
cleanup
costs
reached
A
$
5
million
(
US
$
4.1
million
)
.


Due
to
the
severity
of
the
storm
,
the
name
``
Orson
''
was
retired
after
the
season
.


The
opening
ceremony
of
the
2016
Summer
Olympics
took
place
on
the
evening
of
Friday
5
August
2016
in
the
Maracanã
Stadium
,
Rio
de
Janeiro
,
starting
at
20:00
BRT
(
23:00
UTC
)
.


As
mandated
by
the
Olympic
Charter
,
the
proceedings
combined
the
formal
ceremonial
opening
of
this
international
sporting
event
(
including
welcoming
speeches
,
hoisting
of
the
flags
and
the
parade
of
athletes
,
as
well
as
a
new
feature—the
presentation
of
the
International
Olympic
Committee
's
Olympic
Laurel
distinction
)
with
an
artistic
spectacle
to
showcase
the
host
nation
's
culture
and
history
.


The
Games
were
officially
opened
by
Acting
President
of
Brazil
Michel
Temer
.


Directed
by
Fernando
Meirelles
,
Daniela
Thomas
and
Andrucha
Waddington
,
the
ceremony
featured
presentations
of
the
history
and
culture
of
Brazil
,
including
its
landscape
and
forests
,
the
history
of
the
Brazilian
people
dating
back
to
the
arrival
of
the
Portuguese
,
music
and
samba
,
and
the
favelas
among
other
aspects
.


Portions
of
the
ceremony
were
also
dedicated
to
the
topics
of
environmental
conservation
and
climate
change
.


The
ceremony
was
intended
to
have
a
significantly
lower
cost
than
those
of
other
recent
Olympics
,
with
a
reported
budget
under
R
$
20,433,298
(
US
$
6.5265
million
)
.


The
ceremony
was
praised
by
the
international
media
for
its
vivid
,
diverse
performances
,
emphasis
on
multiculturalism
,
and
its
appeal
to
the
issue
of
climate
change
.


The
Southend
Airshow
,
latterly
officially
known
as
the
Southend
Festival
of
the
Air
,
was
an
annual
airshow
held
in
Southend-on-Sea
,
Essex
,
in
the
United
Kingdom
and
was
held
for
27
consecutive
years
:
it
was
said
to
be
the
longest
running
seafront
airshow
.


The
airshow
usually
spanned
a
two-day
period
in
May
each
year
,
and
was
the
largest
free
airshow
in
Europe
.


The
first
Southend
airshow
was
held
on
Monday
26
May
1986
,
as
the
finale
of
the
Southend
Spring
Festival
.


1986
was
the
only
year
that
there
was
a
fee
charged
to
enter
a
cordoned-off
display
area
,
with
adults
charged
£3
and
children
£1
.


In
order
to
stop
evasion
of
the
entrance
fee
,
8
ft
high
scaffolding
covered
with
nylon
netting
was
erected
.


The
star
of
the
show
on
that
day
was
a
British
Airways
Concorde
,
which
performed
a
double
pass
carrying
150
passengers
whilst
on
its
way
back
to
Heathrow
from
a
trip
round
the
Bay
of
Biscay
.

.


The
cancellation
of
the
airshow
was
announced
by
Southend-on-Sea
Borough
Council
on
14
January
2013
,
as
part
of
the
austerity
cutbacks
by
Southend
Council
;
a
saving
of
£130,000
was
expected
.


An
unsuccessful

Operation
Undertone
was
a
large
assault
by
the
U.S
.


Seventh
and
French
1st
Armies
of
the
U.S.
Sixth
Army
Group
as
part
of
the
Allied
invasion
of
Germany
in
March
1945
during
World
War
II
.


A
force
of
three
corps
was
to
attack
abreast
from
Saarbrücken
,
Germany
,
along
a
75
km
sector
to
a
point
southeast
of
Hagenau
,
France
.


A
narrow
strip
along
the
Rhine
leading
to
the
extreme
northeastern
corner
of
Alsace
at
Lauterbourg
was
to
be
cleared
by
a
division
of
the
French
1st
Army
under
operational
control
of
the
Seventh
Army
.


The
Seventh
Army
's
main
effort
was
to
be
made
in
the
center
up
the
Kaiserslautern
corridor
.


In
approving
the
plan
,
Supreme
Allied
Commander
General
Dwight
D.
Eisenhower
asserted
that
the
objective
was
not
only
to
clear
the
Saar-Palatinate
but
to
establish
bridgeheads
with
forces
of
the
Sixth
Army
Group
over
the
Rhine
between
Mainz
and
Mannheim
.


The
U.S.
Third
Army
of
the
12th
Army
Group
was
to
be
limited
to
diversionary
attacks
across
the
Moselle
to
protect
the
Sixth
Army
Group
's
left
flank
.


Opposing
commanders
were
U.S.
General
Jacob
L.
Devers
,
commanding
U.S.
Sixth
Army
Group
and
German
SS
General
Paul

on
the
weekend
of
march
unk
,
2018
under
a
new
name
;
in
bloom
music
festival
.


This
change
comes
in
precisely
on
the
ninth
anniversary
of
the
FPSF
.


In
January
2019
it
was
announced
that
a
new
edition
of
the
In
Bloom
Music
Festival
would
not
be
held
.


The
Richmond–Petersburg
campaign
was
a
series
of
battles
around
Petersburg
,
Virginia
,
fought
from
June
15
,
1864
,
to
April
2
,
1865
,
during
the
American
Civil
War
.


although
it
is
more
popularly
known
as
the
siege
of
petersburg
,
it
was
not
a
classic
military
siege
,
in
which
a
city
is
usually
surrounded
and
all
supply
lines
are
cut
off
,
nor
was
it
strictly
limited
to
actions
against
petersburg
.


The
campaign
consisted
of
nine
months
of
trench
warfare
in
which
Union
forces
commanded
by
Lt.
Gen.
Ulysses
S.
Grant
assaulted
Petersburg
unsuccessfully
and
then
constructed
trench
lines
that
eventually
extended
over
from
the
eastern
outskirts
of
Richmond
,
Virginia
,
to
around
the
eastern
and
southern
outskirts
of
Petersburg
.


Petersburg
was
crucial
to
the
supply
of
Confederate
Gen.
Robert
E.
Lee
's
army
and
the
Confederate
capital
of
Richmond
.


Numerous
raids
were
conducted
and
battles
fought
in
attempts
to
cut
off
the
Richmond
and
Petersburg
Railroad
.


Many
of
these
battles
caused
the
lengthening
of
the
trench
lines
.


lee
finally
gave
in
to
the
pressure
and
abandoned
both
cities
in
april
1865
,
leading
to
his
retreat
and
surrender
at
appomattox
court
house
.


The
Siege
of
Petersburg
foreshadowed
the
trench
warfare
that
was
common
in
World
War
I
,
earning
it
a
prominent
position
in
military
history
.


It
also
featured
the
war
's
largest
concentration
of
African-American
troops
,
who
suffered
heavy
casualties
at
such
engagements
as
the
Battle
of
the
Crater
and
Chaffin
's
Farm
.


tropical
storm
dean
caused
minor
flooding
along
portions
of
the
east
coast
of
the
united
states
in
september
1983
.


The
seventh
tropical
cyclone
and
fourth
named
storm
the
1983
Atlantic
hurricane
season
,
Dean
developed
from
a
frontal
low
to
the
northeast
of
the
Bahamas
on
September
26
.


Initially
subtropical
,
it
gained
characteristics
of
a
tropical
cyclone
while
tracking
slowly
north-northeastward
.


by
september
27
,
the
system
was
reclassified
as
tropical
storm
dean
.


While
tracking
northward
on
September
28
,
Dean
peaked
with
winds
of
65
mph
(
100
km/h
)
,
shortly
before
curving
west-northwestward
and
slowly
leveling-off
in
intensity
.


Eventually
,
Dean
made
landfall
in
Virginia
on
the
Delmarva
Peninsula
on
September
29
as
a
weakening
tropical
storm
.


Dean
rapidly
weakened
over
land
and
was
no
longer
classifiable
as
a
tropical
cyclone
by
early
on
October
1
.


Offshore
Virginia
,
swells
generated
by
the
storm
stranded
a
tugboat
and
injured
two
people
.


Waves
along
the
coast
also
caused
beach
erosion
,
especially
in
Virginia
and
North
Carolina
.


Inland
,
effects
were
minor
and
generally
limited
to
mostly
light
rainfall
.


More
than
100
campers
on
the
Outer
Banks
of
North
Carolina
were
forced
to
evacuate
due
to
flooding
on
North
Carolina
Highway
12
.


although
unk
wind
gusts
pelted
coastal
areas
of
virginia
and
north
carolina
,
wind
damage
from
the
storm
was
minimal
.


The
remnants
of
the
storm
brought
rainfall
to
portions
of
New
England
,
especially
to
Connecticut
,
where
precipitation
from
the
storm
peaked
at
4.62
in
(
117

.


Damage
from
the
storm
was
unknown
,
but
presumed
to
be
minimal

The
Shyrokyne
standoff
(
February–July
2015
)
was
a
battle
for
the
control
of
the
strategic
village
of
Shyrokyne
,
located
approximately
east
of
Mariupol
city
limits
,
between
Ukrainian
forces
,
led
by
the
Azov
Battalion
,
and
Russian
backed
separatists
.


It
is
part
of
the
larger
War
in
Donbass
.


On
10
February
2015
,
the
Azov
battalion
launched
a
surprise
offensive
against
pro-Russian
separatists
associated
with
the
Donetsk
People
's
Republic
(
DPR
)
with
the
aim
of
pushing
the
separatist
forces
away
from
Mariupol
city
limits
.


The
village
is
located
just
from
the
Ukrainian-controlled
city
of
Mariupol
,
and
was
used
as
a
launching
point
for
separatist
attacks
on
the
city
,
which
served
as
the
administrative
centre
of
Donetsk
Oblast
whilst
DPR
forces
control
Donetsk
city
.


Fighting
continued
until
3
July
2015
,
when
DPR
forces
unilaterally
withdrew
from
Shyrokyne
.


Subsequently
a
cease-fire
was
declared
in
the
area
.


The
2007
Zell
am
See
mid-air
collision
was
an
aviation
accident
that
occurred
on
5
March
2007
,
at
10:53
a.m.
CET
(
09:53
UTC
)
,
in
which
eight
people
died
when
an
Aérospatiale
SA
332
Super
Puma
helicopter
,
operated
by
Helog
,
collided
with
a
private
Diamond
DV20
Katana
light
aircraft
near
Zell
am
See
,
Austria
.


At
the
time
of
the
accident
,
both
aircraft
were
operating
under
visual
flight
rules
.


The
weather
was
good
,
with
a
few
clouds
and
50
km
visibility
.


The
collision
occurred
at
an
altitude
of
about
,
approximately
north-west
of
Zell
am
See
Airport
,
as
the
helicopter
flew
over
the
airport
's
traffic
pattern
travelling
north-north-eastwards
.


at
the
same
time
,
the
light
aircraft
was
climbing
through
the
traffic
pattern
and
was
subsequently
involved
in
a
collision
with
the
helicopter
,
destroying
both
aircraft
.


The
Austrian
Federal
Department
of
Aviation
's
Air
Accident
Investigation
Board
launched
an
investigation
into
the
accident
,
releasing
the
investigation
report
on
9
April
2008
.


The
report
stated
that
the
main
cause
of
the
accident
was
the
inability
of
both
pilots
to
see
the
other
aircraft
in
time
to
avoid
the
collision
as
a
result
of
the
reduced
fields
of
vision
allowed
by
the
cockpit
designs
.


Another
factor
in
the
collision
was
the
subtle
limitations
on
visual
perception
relating
in
part
to
the
proximity
of
the
mountain
slope
not
far
below
both
aircraft
,
requiring
both
pilots
'
attention
to
maintain
suitable
terrain
clearance
.


Typhoon
Rose
,
known
in
the
Philippines
as
Typhoon
Uring
,
was
the
most
violent
and
intense
tropical
cyclone
to
strike
Hong
Kong
since
Typhoon
Wanda
in
1962
.


The
21st
named
storm
of
the
1971
Pacific
typhoon
season
,
Rose
developed
from
an
area
of
disturbed
weather
while
west
of
Guam
on
August
9
.


Moving
west-northwestward
,
the
storm
briefly
became
a
typhoon
on
the
following
day
.


After
weakening
to
a
tropical
storm
on
August
11
,
Rose
re-intensified
into
a
typhoon
several
hours
later
.


The
system
then
curved
westward
and
reached
a
primary
peak
intensity
with
winds
of
205
km/h
(
125
mph
)
on
August
13
.


Later
that
day
,
the
typhoon
made
landfall
near
Palanan
,
Isabela
in
the
Philippines
.


Rose
weakened
significantly
while
crossing
the
island
of
Luzon
and
was
a
minimal
typhoon
upon
reaching
the
South
China
Sea
on
August
14
.


The
storm
intensified
significantly
and
re-curved
northwestward
in
response
to
a
weakening
high-pressure
area
.


Early
on
August
16
,
Rose
attained
its
maximum
sustained
wind
speed
of
220
km/h
(
140
mph
)
–
equivalent
to
a
Category
4
hurricane
on
the
National
Hurricane
Center
's
Saffir–Simpson
hurricane
wind
scale
.


Later
that
day
,
a
ship
observed
the
typhoon
's
minimum
barometric
pressure
of
.


Thereafter
,
the
storm
weakened
slightly
before
making
landfall
at
Lantau
Island
,
Hong
Kong
,
with
winds
of
165
km/h
(
105
mph
)
late
on
August
16
.


Rose
rapidly
weakened
to
a
tropical
storm
early
the
following
day
and
dissipated
several
hours
later
.


Mostly
minor
wind
impact
was
recorded
in
the
Philippines
,
limited
to
downed
communication
lines
and
damaged
houses
.


Offshore
Hong
Kong
,
storm
surge
and
heavy
waves
sank
or
severely
damaged
at
least
300
boats
,
causing
110
deaths
and
283
injuries
.


Inland
,
heavy
rainfall
flooded
low-lying
areas
and
resulted
in
numerous
landslides
.


A
fire
ignited
at
a
large
power
sub-station
in
Kwun
Tong
and
was
difficult
to
extinguish
due
to
strong
winds
.


The
fire
caused
blackouts
in
Kowloon
Peninsula
and
New
Territories
,
trapping
thousands
of
people
in
elevators
.


A
total
of
5,644
people
were
left
homeless
,
while
653
huts
were
destroyed
.


Approximately
30,000
telephones
became
out
of
service
.


Twenty
other
fatalities
occurred
in
Hong

event
.


Despite
concern
over
the
lack
of
snowfall
that
plagued
event
preparation
prior
to
the
championships
,
the
championships
themselves
had
an
abundance
of
snowfall
and
wind
that
caused
the
ski
jumping
part
of
the
Nordic
combined
mass
start
to
be
postponed
for
a
day
and
the
ski
jumping
individual
large
hill
competition
to
be
limited
to
one
jump
.


Attendance
was
between
180,000
and
200,000
,
twice
the
number
at
the
previous
championships
in
Sapporo
,
but
35
to
40
percent
lower
than
the
2005
championships
in
Oberstdorf
.


FIS
President
Gian
Franco
Kasper
commented
at
the
closing
ceremonies
of
the
15
nations
earning
medals
at
these
championships
,
along
with
the
successes
of
the
television
coverage
by
Czech
TV
and
the
success
of
the
women
's
ski
jumping
at
these
championships
would
pave
the
way
for
inclusion
into
the
2014
Winter
Olympics
.


A
broadcast
report
from
the
European
Broadcasting
Union
released
on
4
June
2009
had
total
viewership

the
2009
indian
premier
league
season
,
abbreviated
as
ipl
2
or
the
2009
ipl
,
was
the
second
season
of
the
indian
premier
league
,
established
by
the
board
of
control
for
cricket
in
india
(
bcci
)
in
2007
.


The
tournament
was
hosted
by
South
Africa
and
was
played
between
18
April
and
24
May
2009
.


It
was
the
second
biggest
cricket
tournament
in
the
world
,
after
the
Cricket
World
Cup
,
and
was
forecast
to
have
an
estimated
television
audience
of
more
than
200
million
people
in
India
alone
.


As
the
second
season
of
the
IPL
coincided
with
multi-phase
2009
Indian
general
elections
,
in
the
aftermath
of
the
3
March
2009
attack
on
the
Sri
Lanka
national
cricket
team
the
Government
of
India
refused
to
commit
security
by
Indian
paramilitary
forces
.


As
a
result
,
the
BCCI
decided
to
host
the
second
season
of
the
league
outside
India
.


On
24
March
2009
,
the
BCCI
officially
announced
that
the
second
season
of
the
IPL
was
to
be
held
in
South
Africa
.


though
india
did
not
host
the
second
season
,
the
format
of
the
tournament
remained
unchanged
from
the
2008
season
format
.


The
IPL
injected
approximately
US
$
100
million
into
South
Africa
's
local
economy
.


In
addition
,
the
BCCI
signed
an
82
billion
(
US
$
1.63
billion
)
contract
with
Multi
Screen
Media
to
broadcast
matches
live
from
South
Africa
to
India
.


The
IPL
was
hosted
successfully
in
South
Africa
and
was
hailed
as
an
``
extraordinary
''
accomplishment
.


The
tournament
was
particularly
praised
for
globalizing
cricket
and
had
set
record
television
viewership
.


The
tournament
was
won
by
Deccan
Chargers
while
the
Royal
Challengers
Bangalore
were
declared
as
runners-up
.


A
political
crisis
evolved
in
Tunisia
following
the
assassination
of
leftist
leader
Mohamed
Brahmi
in
late
July
2013
,
during
which
the
country
's
mainly
secular
opposition
organized
several
protests
against
the
ruling
Troika
alliance
that
was
dominated
by
Rashid
al-Ghannushi
's
Islamist
Ennahda
Movement
.


The
events
came
as
part
of
the
aftermath
of
the
Tunisian
Revolution
which
ousted
the
country
's
longtime
president
Zine
El
Abidine
Ben
Ali
,
followed
by
a
general
election
which
saw
Ennahda
win
a
plurality
alongside
Moncef
Marzouki
's
allied
Congress
for
the
Republic
(
CPR
)
.


The
crisis
gradually
subsided
when
Prime
Minister
Ali
Laarayedh
resigned
and
a
new
constitution
was
adopted
in
January
2014
.


Many
incidents
fueled
the
protests
including
the
assassination
of
prominent
secular
leaders
Chokri
Belaid
on
6
February
2013
and
Mohamed
Brahmi
on
25
July
.


Other
factors
include
the
government
's
failure
to
deal
with
the
rise
of
hardline
Salafist
groups
including
Ansar
al-Sharia
which
is
widely
believed
to
be
behind
the
assassinations
,
as
well
as
many
other
attacks

This
prompted
the
government
to
list
the
group
as
a
terrorist
organization
amid
growing
pressure
by
opposition
groups
.


The
protests
intensified
on
23
October
2013
,
when
thousands
of
demonstrators
took
to
the
streets
calling
for
the
government
to
step
down
hours
before
talks
between
the
ruling
Islamist
coalition
and
opposition
leaders
that
concluded
with
Ennahda
promising
to
resign
in
three
weeks
ending
a
months-old
political
deadlock
.


In
exchange
for
Ennahda
's
resignation
,
the
opposition
agreed
to
pass
a
constitution
in
which
freedom
of
worship
will
be
guaranteed
but
in
the
same
time
gave
a
greater
role
to
religion
in
public
life
than
before

The
invasion
of
Iceland
by
the
Royal
Navy
and
Royal
Marines
occurred
on
10
May
1940
,
during
World
War
II
.


The
invasion
was
performed
because
the
British
government
feared
that
Iceland
would
be
used
by
the
Germans
,
who
had
recently
overrun
Denmark
,
Iceland
's
possessing
country
.


The
Government
of
Iceland
issued
a
protest
,
charging
that
its
neutrality
had
been
``
flagrantly
violated
''
and
``
its
independence
infringed
''
.


At
the
start
of
the
war
,
the
UK
imposed
strict
export
controls
on
Icelandic
goods
,
preventing
profitable
shipments
to
Germany
,
as
part
of
its
naval
blockade
.


The
UK
offered
assistance
to
Iceland
,
seeking
co-operation
``
as
a
belligerent
and
an
ally
''
,
but
Reykjavík
refused
and
reaffirmed
its
neutrality
.


The
German
diplomatic
presence
in
Iceland
,
along
with
the
island
's
strategic
importance
,
alarmed
the
UK
government
.


After
failing
to
persuade
the
Icelandic
government
to
join
the
Allies
,
the
UK
invaded
on
the
morning
of
10
May
1940
.


The
initial
force
of
746
Royal
Marines
commanded
by
Colonel
Robert
Sturges
disembarked
at
the
capital
Reykjavík
.


Meeting
no
resistance
,
the
troops
moved
quickly
to
disable
communication
networks
,
secure
strategic
locations
,
and
arrest
German
citizens
.


Requisitioning
local
transport
,
the
troops
moved
to
Hvalfjörður
,
Kaldaðarnes
,
Sandskeið
,
and
Akranes
to
secure
potential
landing
areas
against
the
possibility
of
a
German
counterattack
.


The
Dekemvriana
(
,
``
December
events
''
)
refers
to
a
series
of
clashes
fought
during
World
War
II
in
Athens
from
3
December
1944
to
11
January
1945
.


The
conflict
was
the
culmination
of
months
of
tension
between
the
communist
EAM
,
some
parts
of
its
military
wing
,
the
ELAS
stationed
in
Athens
,
the
KKE
and
the
OPLA
from
one
side
and
from
the
other
side
,
the
,
some
parts
of
the
Hellenic
Royal
Army
,
the
Hellenic
Gendarmerie
,
the
Cities
Police
,
the
far-right
Organization
X
,
among
others
and
also
the
British
Army
.


Regardless
of
the
tensions
between
the
left
and
the
right
,
on
May
1944
it
had
been
roughly
agreed
in
the
Lebanon
Conference
that
all
non-collaborationist
factions
would
participate
in
a
Government
of
National
Unity
;
eventually
6
out
of
24
ministers
were
appointed
by
EAM
.


additionally
,
a
few
weeks
before
the
withdrawal
of
the
german
troops
on
october
1944
,
it
had
been
reaffirmed
in
the
caserta
agreement
that
all
collaborationist
forces
would
be
tried
and
punished
accordingly
;
and
that
all
resistance
forces
would
participate
in
the
formation
of
the
new
greek
army
,
under
the
command
of
the
british
.


Yet
,
on
December
1
,
the
British
commander
Ronald
Scobie
ordered
the
unilateral
disarmament
of
EAM-ELAS
.


The
EAM
ministers
resigned
on
the
2nd
of
December
and
EAM
called
for
a
rally
in
central
Athens
on
the
3rd
,
requesting
the
immediate
punishment
of
the
collaborationist
Security
Battalions
and
the
withdrawal
of
the
``
Scobie
''
order
.


The
rally
of
some
200,000
people
was
shot
at
by
the
Greek
Police
and
Gendarmerie
,
leaving
28
protesters
dead
and
148
wounded
.


These
killings
ushered
a
full-blown
armed
confrontation
between
EAM
and
the
Government
forces
at
first
(
which
included
the
Security
Battalions
)
,
and
during
the
2nd
half
of
December
,
against
the
full-blown
British
military
forces
.


The
clashes
were
limited
to
Athens
,
while
elsewhere
in
Greece
the
situation
remained
tense
but
peaceful
,
with
the
exception
of
Epirus
where
Velouchiotis
attacked
the
forces
of
Zervas
.


the
``
unk
''
ended
with
the
defeat
of
unk
,
leading
to
its
disarmament
in
the
unk
agreement
which
marked
the
end
of
elas
.


This
first
defeat
broke
the
power
of
EAM
.


This
together
with
the
EAM-instigated
``
Red
Terror
''
was
followed
by
a
period
of
``
White
Terror
''
against
the
left
,
which
contributed
to
the
outbreak
of
the
Greek
Civil
War
in
1946
.


The
Zahiri
Revolt
was
a
conspiracy
leading
to
a
failed
coup
d'état
against
the
government
of
the
14th-century
Mamluk
Sultanate
,
having
been
characterized
as
both
a
political
struggle
and
a
theological
conflict
.


While
the
initial
support
for
the
potential
overthrow
of
the
sultan
began
in
Egypt
,
movement
of
Egyptian
ideological
agitators
to
Syria
eventually
caused
the
actual
planned
uprising
to
take
place
in
Damascus
in
1386
.


Rallying
around
Ahmad
al-Zahiri
,
a
cleric
of
the
Zahirite
school
of
Sunni
Islam
,
the
agitators
mobilized
from
Hama
to
the
capital
.


Having
failed
to
secure
the
support
of
both
the
Mamluks
and
local
Arab
tribes
,
they
were
arrested
by
the
authorities
of
Barquq
before
armed
conflict
could
even
take
place
.


although
not
all
those
taking
part
in
the
revolt
accepted
the
views
of
the
zahiri
school
of
law
,
the
term
was
used
to
denote
all
of
those
willing
to
participate
in
armed
conflict
against
the
mamluk
sultan
.


The
suppression
of
the
revolt
both
practically
and
ideologically
has
been
described
as
a
sign
of
the
Mamluk
authorities
'
intolerance
for
non-conformist
ideas
and
willingness
to
interfere
in
religious
issues
normally
considered
the
domain
of
theologians
in
Muslim
empires
.

,
which
sought
to
free
the

and
expel
the

from
the
city
.


The
standoff
degenerated
into
urban
warfare
,
and
brought
parts
of
the
city
into
a
standstill
for
days
.


The
clashes
caused
the
displacement
of
more
than
100,000
people
,
the
occupation
of
several
barangays
(
villages
)
by
the
MNLF

The
2010s
were
marked
by
further

Thousands
of
youths
pelted
security
forces
with
rocks
,
burned

for
stoking
the

and
acts
of
terror
against
Kashmiri
civilian

The
Battle
of
San
Carlos
was
a
battle
between
the
Portuguese
forces
under
Francisco
das
Chagas
Santos
and
the
Misionero
forces
led
by
Andrés
Guazurary
,
popularly
known
as
Andresito
,
in
San
Carlos
,
modern-day
Argentina
.


After
having
been
defeated
by
Andresito
on
the
previous
year
,
Portuguese
commander
Francisco
das
Chagas
Santos
prepared
for
a
new
military
campaign
against
the
Misioneros
,
with
a
force
of
800
men
and
2
artillery
pieces
.


After
taking
the
chapel
of
San
Alonso
,
Chagas
headed
for
the
Mission
of
San
Carlos
,
where
the
independentist
forces
led
by
Andresito
and
Serapio
Rodriguez
awaited
the
Portuguese
.


After
days
of
very
intense
fighting
,
the
Portuguese
managed
to
control
most
of
the
town
and
push
Andresito
's
men
to
San
Carlos
'
church
and
college
,
in
which
heavy
fighting
continued
to
occur
,
while
they
expected
for
reinforcements
to
come
.


However
,
the
column
of
Captain
Arand
that
had
the
objective
of
helping
the
rebels
was
attacked
by
the
Portuguese
and
crushed
,
having
its
commander
been
killed
.


On
the
third
day
of
battle
,
the
buildings
in
which
the
rebels
were
caught
fire
,
making
their
situation
even
more
desperate
and
forcing
them
into
submission
,
even
though
some
men
,
including
Andresito
himself
,
managed
to
escape
.


The
battle
resulted
not
only
in
a
major
victory
for
the
Portuguese
,
but
also
to
the
de
facto
elimination
of
Andresito
's
threat
to
them

1894
,
gabo
peasant
revolution
,
and
a
variety
of
other
names
,
was
an
armed
rebellion
in
korea
led
by
aggravated
peasants
and
followers
of
the
donghak
religion
,
a
panentheistic
religion
viewed
by
many
rebels
as
a
political
ideology
.


In
1894
,
the
magistrate
of
Gobu
,
Jo
Byeonggap
,
had
created
various
bogus
laws
and
forced
the
peasants
to
build
reservoirs
and
settle
in
unowned
lands
in
order
to
get
rich
from
taxes
and
fines
.


In
March
,
angered
peasants
allied
under
Jeon
Bongjun
and
Kim
Gaenam
,
beginning
the
Gobu
Revolt
.


However
,
the
Gobu
revolt
was
suppressed
by
Yi
Yongtae
,
and
Jeon
Bongjun
fled
to
Taein
.


in
april
,
jeon
gathered
an
army
in
mount
baek
and
recaptured
unk
.


The
rebels
then
proceeded
to
defeat
governmental
forces
in
Hwangto
Pass
and
the
Hwangryong
River
.


Jeon
then
captured
Jeonju
Fortress
and
fought
in
a
siege
with
Hong
Gyehun
's
Joseon
forces
.


In
May
,
however
,
the
rebels
had
signed
a
truce
with
the
governmental
forces
,
and
built
agencies
called
``
Jibgangso
''
that
handled
affairs
in
rebel-controlled
areas
.


This
somewhat
unsteady
peace
continued
throughout
the
summer
.


The
frightened
government
asked
the
Qing
dynasty
for
help
,
and
it
sent
2,700
soldiers
to
Korea
.


Japan
,
angered
that
the
Qing
government
,
had
not
informed
Japan
(
as
promised
in
the
Convention
of
Tientsin
)
,
started
the
First
Sino-Japanese
War
.


The
war
resulted
in
an
expulsion
of
Chinese
influence
in
Korea
and
also
signaled
an
end
for
the
Self-Strengthening
Movement
in
China
itself
.


Growing
Japanese
dominance
in
the
Korean
peninsula
had
caused
anxiety
amongst
the
rebels
.


From
September
to
October
,
the
Southern
and
Northern
leaders
negotiated
the
plans
for
the
future
in
Samrye
.


On
October
12
,
a
coalition
army
of
Northern
and
Southern
Jeobs
were
formed
,
and
the
army
,
numbering
25,000~200,000
(
records
differ
)
,
went
on
to
attack
Gongju
.


After
a
number
of
battles
,
the
rebel
army
was
decisively
defeated
in
the
Battle
of
Ugeumchi
,
and
the
rebels
were
again
defeated
in
the
Battle
of
Taein
.


Hostility
continued
deep
into
the
spring
of
1895
.


The
rebel
leaders
were
captured
in
various
locations
in
the
Honam
Region
,
and
most
were
executed
by
a
mass
hanging
in
March
.


The
2000
CONCACAF
Gold
Cup
was
the
fifth
edition
of
the
Gold
Cup
,
the
soccer
championship
of
North
America
,
Central
America
and
the
Caribbean
(
CONCACAF
)
,
and
the
15th
overall
CONCACAF
tournament
.


It
was
held
in
Los
Angeles
,
Miami
,
and
San
Diego
in
the
United
States
.


The
format
of
the
tournament
changed
from
1998
;
it
was
expanded
to
twelve
teams
,
split
into
four
groups
of
three
.


The
top
two
teams
in
each
group
would
advance
to
the
quarter-finals
.


Peru
and
Colombia
were
invited
from
CONMEBOL
,
and
the
Republic
of
Korea
were
invited
from
AFC
.


With
all
three
games
in
Group
D
ending
in
ties
and
Canada
tied
with
the
Republic
of
Korea
on
every
tiebreaker
,
a
coin
toss
was
used
.


Canada
won
and
advanced
to
the
quarter-finals
.


They
went
on
to
win
their
first
and
to
date
only
Gold
Cup
title
.


In
the
quarter-finals
,
Canada
upset
defending
champions
Mexico
in
golden
goal
extra
time
2–1
.


They
defeated
Trinidad
and
Tobago
in
the
semi-finals
1–0
after
Craig
Forrest
saved
a
first-half
penalty
.


Already
assured
as
CONCACAF
champions
,
Canada
topped
invitees
Colombia
2–0
in
the
final
.


The
tournament
marks
the
only
time
a
CONCACAF
Gold
Cup
has
been
won
by
a
country
other
than
the
United
States
or
Mexico
,
and
the
only
time
in
the
tournament
's
history
that
neither
the
United
States
nor
Mexico
made
the
final
.

the
29th
final
of
Europe

second
largest
club

Winners
'

,
and
also
initially

.


The
final
was
somewhat
marred
by
the
riots
between
supporters
of
the
two
sides
.


The
2007
Fort
Dix
attack
plot
involved
a
group
of
six
Muslim
men
who
were
found
guilty
of
conspiring
to
stage
an
attack
against
U.S.
Military
personnel
stationed
at
Fort
Dix
,
New
Jersey
.


The
alleged
goal
of
the
group
was
to
``
kill
as
many
soldiers
as
possible
''
.


The
men
were
arrested
by
the
Federal
Bureau
of
Investigation
(
FBI
)
on
May
8
,
2007
,
and
were
prosecuted
in
federal
court
in
October
2008
.


On
December
22
,
2008
,
five
were
found
guilty
of
conspiracy
to
commit
murder
in
their
intentions
to
kill
U.S.
military
personnel
;
four
received
life
sentences
,
while
one
received
33
years
in
prison
.


The
remaining
member
was
thought
to
have
had
a
minor
role
in
the
plot
and
was
sentenced
to
five
years
in
prison
for
weapons
offenses
.


Some
accuse
the
FBI
of
entrapment
,
stating
that
the
FBI
informants
created
the
conspiracy
.


The
FBI
used
two
convicts
as
paid
informants
in
the
case
,
one
of
whom
was
fighting
deportation
.


The
three
Duka
brothers
are
appealing
.


Because
of
the
plot
,
the
three
Duka
brothers
,
Shnewer
,
and
Abdullahu
have
been
referred
to
as
the
``
Fort
Dix
Five
''
.


The
brothers
had
a
history
of
encounters
with
police
.


Between
1996
and
2006
,
Cherry
Hill
police
charged
Dritan
and
Shain
Duka
with
a
number
of
disorderly
persons
offenses
,
including
marijuana
possession
,
improper
behavior
,
prowling
,
disturbing
the
peace
,
and
obstructing
the
administration
of
law
.


They
were
fined
between
$
20
and
$
830
on
various
occasions
and
sent
home
,
according
to
court
records
.


The
three
brothers
were
also
issued
about
50
traffic
citations
between
1997
and
2006
–
more
than
20
by
Cherry
Hill
police
–
for
speeding
,
driving
without
licenses
,
driving
while
on
the
suspended
list
,
failure
to
appear
in
court
,
and
other
charges
.


The
2009
USS
``
Port
Royal
''
grounding
was
a
ship
grounding
by
the
United
States
Navy
guided
missile
cruiser
``
Port
Royal
''
off
Oahu
,
Hawaii
on
5
February
2009
.


The
ship
ran
aground
on
a
coral
reef
,
damaging
both
the
ship
and
the
reef
.


The
incident
received
wide
press
coverage
in
Hawaii
,
in
part
because
of
the
damage
caused
to
a
sensitive
coral
environment
,
and
also
because
the
stranded
ship
was
within
sight
of
Honolulu
.


Navy
investigation
found
that
the
grounding
was
caused
by
a
combination
of
a
misread
navigation
system
,
a
sleep-deprived
commanding
officer
,
broken
equipment
,
and
an
inexperienced
and
dysfunctional
bridge
team
.


Commanding
officer
Captain
John
Carroll
was
relieved
of
duty
and
disciplined
.


Three
other
officers
and
one
enlisted
sailor
were
also
disciplined
.


The
Navy
reattached
5,400
coral
colonies
in
an
attempt
to
repair
damage
to
the
reef
.


The
Siege
of
Athens
lasted
through
287
BC
when
the
city
was
put
under
siege
by
King
Demetrius
I
of
Macedon
.


Athens
revolted
in
that
year
against
Demetrius
'
rule
and
elected
Olympiodorus
as
strategos
.


Olympiodorus
raised
a
force
among
the
Athenian
citizens
,
including
old
men
and
children
,
and
attacked
the
Macedonian
garrison
that
had
retreated
to
the
fort
at
the
Museum
hill
which
he
took
with
the
loss
of
just
13
of
his
men
.


On
receiving
news
of
the
revolt
Demetrius
gathered
forces
from
the
cities
he
still
held
and
put
Athens
under
siege
.


The
Athenians
sent
the
philosopher
Crates
to
negotiate
with
Demetrius
.


In
the
treaty
signed
Demetrius
received
some
fortresses
in
Attica
but
Athens
was
freed
from
a
Macedonian
garrison
.

The
Battle
of
Ramillies
(
)
,
fought
on
23
May
1706
,
was
a
battle
of
the
War
of
the
Spanish
Succession
.


For
the
Grand
Alliance
–
Austria
,
England
,
and
the
Dutch
Republic
–
the
battle
had
followed
an
indecisive
campaign
against
the
Bourbon
armies
of
King
Louis
XIV
of
France
in
1705
.


although
the
allies
had
captured
barcelona
that
year
,
they
had
been
forced
to
abandon
their
campaign
on
the
moselle
,
had
stalled
in
the
spanish
netherlands
and
suffered
defeat
in
northern
italy
.


Yet
despite
his
opponents
'
setbacks
Louis
XIV
wanted
peace
,
but
on
reasonable
terms
.


Because
of
this
,
as
well
as
to
maintain
their
momentum
,
the
French
and
their
allies
took
the
offensive
in
1706
.


The
campaign
began
well
for
Louis
XIV
's
generals
:
in
Italy
Marshal
Vendôme
defeated
the
Austrians
at
the
Battle
of
Calcinato
in
April
,
while
in
Alsace
Marshal
Villars
forced
the
Margrave
of
Baden
back
across
the
Rhine
.


Encouraged
by
these
early
gains
Louis
XIV
urged
Marshal
Villeroi
to
go
over
to
the
offensive
in
the
Spanish
Netherlands
and
,
with
victory
,
gain
a
'fair
'
peace
.


Accordingly
,
the
French
Marshal
set
off
from
Leuven
(
``
Louvain
''
)
at
the
head
of
60,000
men
and
marched
towards
Tienen
(
``
Tirlemont
''
)
,
as
if
to
threaten
Zoutleeuw
(
``
Léau
''
)
.


Also
determined
to
fight
a
major
engagement
,
the
Duke
of
Marlborough
,
commander-in-chief
of
Anglo-Dutch
forces
,
assembled
his
army
–
some
62,000
men
–
near
Maastricht
,
and
marched
past
Zoutleeuw
.


With
both
sides
seeking
battle
,
they
soon
encountered
each
other
on
the
dry
ground
between
the
Mehaigne
and
Petite
Gheete
rivers
,
close
to
the
small
village
of
Ramillies
.


In
less
than
four
hours
Marlborough
's
Dutch
,
English
,
and
Danish
forces
overwhelmed
Villeroi
's
and
Max
Emanuel
's
Franco-Spanish-Bavarian
army
.


The
Duke
's
subtle
moves
and
changes
in
emphasis
during
the
battle
–
something
his
opponents
failed
to
realise
until
it
was
too
late
–
caught
the
French
in
a
tactical
vice
.


With
their
foe
broken
and
routed
,
the
Allies
were
able
to
fully
exploit
their
victory
.


Town
after
town
fell
,
including
Brussels
,
Bruges
and
Antwerp
;
by
the
end
of
the
campaign
Villeroi
's
army
had
been
driven
from
most
of
the
Spanish
Netherlands
.


With
Prince
Eugene
's
subsequent
success
at
the
Battle
of
Turin

the
Allies
had
imposed
the
greatest
loss
of
territory
and
resources
that
Louis
XIV
would
suffer
during
the
war

Thus

the
year
1706
proved

The
January
25
,
2012
Vieira
Fazenda
office
block
collapse
involved
the
progressive
collapse
of
3
commercial
office
buildings
,
split
by
R.
Vieira
Fazenda
street
in
the
municipality
of
Praça
Floriano
,
Rio
de
Janeiro
,
Brazil
.


The
three
buildings
involved
were
(
from
west
to
east
)
:
Building
1
(
a
22-story
building
located
at
Av
.


Alm
.


Barroso
,

Centro
,
Rio
de
Janeiro
,

,
Building
2
(
a
23-story
building
located
at
Av
.


Alm
.


Barroso
,
22

Centro
,
Rio
de

,

and
Building
3
(
a
6-story
building
located
at
Av
.


Rio
Branco
,
180
-
Centro
,
Rio
de
Janeiro
,
20040-003
,
Brazil
)
.


at
8:33
pm
,
the
23-story
building
2
,
began
collapsing
in
the
eastward
direction
towards
the
6-story
building
3
,
which
was
located
on
the
opposite
side
of
r.
vieira
fazenda
street
.


Building
2
was
structurally
connected
to
the
adjoining
22-story
Building
1
,
which
caused
it
to
pull
Building
1
laterally
eastward
during
its
collapse
.


This
extreme
lateral
shift
caused
the
failure
of
enough
support
columns
to
result
in
the
collapse
of
Building
1
.


As
Building
2
continued
its
collapse
in
the
eastward
direction
,
its
debris
crashed
through
the
roof
and
western
load
bearing
wall
of
the
6-story
Building
3
,
causing
it
to
collapse
as
well
.


A
total
of
17
people
were
killed
in
the
disaster
.


The
initial
collapse
of
the
23-story
Building
2
,
was
due
to
structural
failure
.


Regulators
said
that
any
construction
done
violated
local
building
codes
as
there
were
no
construction
permits
on
file
for
the
building
.

The
Battle
at
Springmartin
was
a
series
of
gun
battles
in
Belfast
,
Northern
Ireland
on
13–14
May
1972
.


it
involved
the
british
army
,
the
provisional
irish
republican
army
(
ira
)
,
and
the
ulster
volunteer
force
(
uvf
)
.


The
violence
began
when
a
car
bomb
,
planted
by
Ulster
loyalists
,
exploded
outside
a
crowded
public
house
in
the
mainly
Irish
nationalist
and
Catholic
district
of
Ballymurphy
.


UVF
snipers
then
opened
fire
on
the
survivors
from
an
abandoned
high-rise
flat
.


This
began
the
worst
fighting
in
Northern
Ireland
since
the
suspension
of
the
Parliament
of
Northern
Ireland
and
the
imposition
of
direct
rule
from
London
.


For
the
rest
of
the
night
and
throughout
the
next
day
,
local
IRA
units
fought
gun
battles
with
both
the
UVF
and
British
Army
.


Most
of
the
fighting
took
place
along
the
interface
between
the
Catholic
Ballymurphy
and
Ulster
Protestant
Springmartin
housing
estates
,
and
the
British
Army
base
that
sat
between
them
.


Seven
people
were
killed
in
the
violence
:
five
civilians
(
four
Catholics
,
one
Protestant
)
,
a
British
soldier
and
a
member
of
the
IRA
Youth
Section
.


Four
of
the
dead
were
teenagers
.


The
``
Ypiranga
''
Incident
occurred
on
April
21
,
1914
,
at
the
port
of
Veracruz
in
Mexico
.


The
SS
``
Ypiranga
''
was
a
German
steamer
that
was
commissioned
to
transport
arms
and
munitions
to
the
Mexican
federal
government
under
Victoriano
Huerta
.


The
United
States
had
placed
Mexico
under
an
arms
embargo
to
stifle
the
flow
of
weaponry
to
the
war-torn
state
,
then
in
the
throes
of
civil
war
,
forcing
Huerta
's
government
to
look
to
Europe
and
Japan
for
armaments
.


``
Ypiranga
''
tried
to
enter
the
harbor
at
Veracruz
to
unload
on
the
first
day
of
the
US
occupation
but
was
detained
by
US
troops
who
were
ordered
by
President
of
the
United
States
Woodrow
Wilson
to
enforce
the
arms
embargo
he
had
placed
on
Mexico
.


There
was
neither
a
declaration
of
war
on
Mexico
by
the
United
States
nor
a
formal
blockade
on
its
ports
,
thus
the
detention
of
``
Ypiranga
''
was
not
legal
and
she
was
released
.


She
proceeded
to
a
port
where
the
US
military
was
absent
,
Puerto
México
(
modern-day
Coatzacoalcos
,
Veracruz
)
,
and
was
able
to
offload
her
cargo
to
Huerta
's
officials
.


The
presidency
of
Thomas
Jefferson
began
on
March
4
,
1801
,
when
he
was
inaugurated
as
the
third
President
of
the
United
States
,
and
ended
on
March
4
,
1809
.


Jefferson
assumed
the
office
after
defeating
incumbent
President
John
Adams
in
the
1800
presidential
election
.


the
election
was
a
realigning
election
in
which
the
democratic-republican
party
swept
the
federalist
party
out
of
power
,
ushering
in
a
generation
of
democratic-republican
dominance
in
american
politics
.


after
serving
two
terms
,
jefferson
was
succeeded
by
secretary
of
state
james
madison
,
also
of
the
democratic-republican
party
.


Jefferson
took
office
determined
to
roll
back
the
Federalist
program
of
the
1790s
.


His
administration
reduced
taxes
,
government
spending
,
and
the
national
debt
,
and
repealed
the
Alien
and
Sedition
Acts
.


In
foreign
affairs
,
the
major
developments
were
the
acquisition
of
the
gigantic
Louisiana
Purchase
from
France
in
1803
,
an
embargo
against
trade
with
both
Great
Britain
and
France
,
and
worsening
relations
with
Britain
as
the
United
States
tried
to
remain
neutral
in
the
midst
of
the
Napoleonic
Wars
that
engulfed
Europe
.


He
established
a
military
academy
,
used
the
Navy
to
protect
merchant
ships
from
Barbary
pirates
in
North
Africa
,
and
developed
a
plan
to
protect
U.S.
ports
from
foreign
invasion
by
the
use
of
small
gunboats
(
a
plan
that
proved
useless
when
war
came
in
1812
)
.


He
also
authorized
the
Lewis
and
Clark
expedition
to
explore
the
Louisiana
Territory
and
the
Pacific
Northwest
.


During
his
second
term
,
Jefferson
's
attention
was
focused
on
the
trial
of
then
former
Vice
President
Burr
for
treason
,
which
resulted
in
an
acquittal
,
and
on
the
issue
of
slavery
,
specifically
the
importation
of
slaves
from
abroad
.


In
1806
,
he
denounced
the
international
slave
trade
as
a
``
violation
of
human
rights
''
and
called
upon
Congress
to
criminalize
it
.


Congress
responded
by
approving
the
Act
Prohibiting
Importation
of
Slaves
the
following
year
.


Rising
tensions
between
the
United
States
and
Britain
dominated
the
final
years
of
Jefferson
's
second
term
,
as
the
Royal
Navy
began
impressing
sailors
from
American
ships
and
attacking
American
shipping
.


Jefferson
rejected
war
and
instead
used
economic
threats
and
embargoes
that
ultimately
hurt
the
U.S.
more
than
Britain
.


the
disputes
with
britain
continued
after
jefferson
left
office
,
eventually
leading
to
the
war
of
1812
.


Despite
the
economic
and
political
troubles
caused
by
naval
tensions
with
Britain
,
Jefferson
was
succeeded
by
his
preferred
successor
in
the
form
of
James
Madison
.


His
legacy
remained
highly
influential
until
the
American
Civil
War
,
but
his
reputation
has
ebbed
and
flowed
since
then
.


Nonetheless
,
in
surveys
of
academic
historians
and
political
scientists
,
Jefferson
is
consistently
ranked
as
one
of
the
nation
's
most
esteemed
presidents
.


Teknivals
(
the
word
is
a
portmanteau
of
the
words
tekno
and
festival
)
are
large
free
parties
which
take
place
worldwide
.


They
take
place
most
often
in
Europe
and
are
often
illegal
under
various
national
or
regional
laws
.


They
vary
in
size
from
dozens
to
thousands
of
people
,
depending
on
factors
such
as
accessibility
,
reputation
,
weather
,
and
law
enforcement
.


The
parties
often
take
place
in
venues
far
away
from
residential
areas
such
as
squatted
warehouses
,
empty
military
bases
,
beaches
,
forests
or
fields
.


The
teknival
phenomenon
is
a
grassroots
movement
which
has
grown
out
of
the
rave
,
punk
,
reggae
sound
system
and
UK
traveller
scenes
and
spawned
an
entire
subculture
.


Summer
is
the
usual
season
for
teknivals
.

the
Polish–Lithuanian
Commonwealth
,
a
part
of
the
Great
Northern
War
.


Its
purpose
was
to
crush
Charles
XII
's
army
with
overwhelming
force
in
a
combined
offensive
of
Russian
and
Saxon
troops
.


The
campaign
,
executed
by
Peter
I
of
Russia
and
Augustus
II
of
Saxony
,
began
in
July
1705
and
lasted
almost
a
year
.


In
divided
areas
the
allies
would
jointly
strike
the
Swedish
troops
occupied
in
Poland
,
in
order
to
neutralize
the
influence
the
Swedes
had
in
the
Polish
politics
.


However
,
the
Swedish
forces
under
Charles
XII
successfully
outmaneuvered
the
allies
,
installed
a
Polish
king
in
favor
of
their
own
and
finally
won
two
decisive
victories
at
Grodno
and
Fraustadt
in
1706
.


this
resulted
in
the
treaty
of
unk
(
1706
)
in
which
augustus
renounced
his
claims
to
the
polish
throne
,
broke
off
his
alliance
with
russia
,
and
established
peace
between
sweden
and
saxony
.


the
campaign
led
to
sweden
gaining
control
over
the
polish-lithuanian
commonwealth
,
until
the
swedish
defeat
at
battle
of
poltava
and
the
treaty
of
thorn
(
1709
)
which
restored
the
unk
augustus
to
the
polish
throne
and
forced
the
remaining
swedes
out
of
the
commonwealth
.


The
Shaar
HaNegev
school
bus
attack
was
a
missile
attack
on
7
April
2011
,
in
which
Hamas
militants
in
the
Gaza
Strip
fired
a
Kornet
laser-guided
anti-tank
missile
over
the
border
at
an
Israeli
school
bus
,
killing
a
schoolboy
.


Hamas
claimed
the
bus
was
traveling
on
a
road
used
by
Israeli
military
vehicles
and
it
did
not
know
that
schoolchildren
were
on
board
.


Israel
said
the
yellow
color
of
the
bus
made
it
easily
identifiable
and
accused
Hamas
of
``
crossing
a
line
.
''


The
missile
hit
the
bus
after
all
but
one
of
the
children
had
been
dropped
off
.


The
only
remaining
passenger
,
a
16-year-old
boy
,
Daniel
Viflic
,
was
critically
injured
with
shrapnel
wounds
to
the
head
and
died
from
his
injuries
on
17
April
.


The
driver
was
lightly
injured
.


Another
mortar
barrage
was
timed
to
coincide
with
the
arrival
of
the
paramedics
,
which
delayed
the
evacuation
.


The
attack
was
condemned
by
the
international
community
.


The
Wars
in
Lombardy
were
a
series
of
conflicts
between
the
Republic
of
Venice
and
the
Duchy
of
Milan
and
their
respective
allies
,
fought
in
four
campaigns
in
a
struggle
for
hegemony
in
Northern
Italy
that
ravaged
the
economy
of
Lombardy
and
weakened
the
power
of
Venice
.


they
lasted
from
1423
until
the
signing
of
the
treaty
of
lodi
in
1454
.


During
their
course
,
the
political
structure
of
Italy
was
transformed
:
out
of
a
competitive
congeries
of
communes
and
city-states
emerged
the
five
major
Italian
territorial
powers
that
would
make
up
the
map
of
Italy
for
the
remainder
of
the
15th
century
and
the
beginning
of
the
Italian
Wars
at
the
turn
of
the
16th
century
.


They
were
Venice
,
Milan
,
Florence
,
the
Papal
States
and
Naples
.


Important
cultural
centers
of
Tuscany
and
Northern
Italy—Siena
,
Pisa
,
Urbino
,
Mantua
,
Ferrara—became
politically
marginalized
.


The
wars
,
which
were
both
a
result
and
cause
of
Venetian
involvement
in
the
power
politics
of
mainland
Italy
,
found
Venetian
territory
extended
to
the
banks
of
the
Adda
and
involved
the
rest
of
Italy
in
shifting
alliances
but
only
minor
skirmishing
.


The
shifting
counterweight
in
the
balance
was
the
allegiance
of
Florence
,
at
first
allied
with
Venice
against
encroachments
by
Visconti
Milan
,
then
switching
to
ally
with
Francesco
Sforza
against
the
increasing
territorial
threat
of
Venice
.


The
Peace
of
Lodi
,
concluded
in
1454
,
brought
forty
years
of
comparative
peace
to
Northern
Italy
,
as
Venetian
conflicts
focused
elsewhere
.


after
the
treaty
of
lodi
,
there
was
a
balance
of
power
resulting
in
a
period
of
stability
lasting
for
40
years
.


During
this
time
,
there
was
a
mutual
pledge
of
non-aggression
between
the
five
Italian
powers
,
sometimes
known
as
the
Italic
League
.


Even
there
was
frequent
tension
between
Milan
and
Naples
,
the
peace
held
remarkably
well
until
the
outbreak
of
the
Italian
Wars
in
1494
,
as
Milan
called
upon
the
king
of
France
to
press
its
claim
on
the
kingdom
of
Naples
.


The
Maxim
restaurant
suicide
bombing
was
a
suicide
bombing
which
occurred
on
October
4
,
2003
in
the
beachfront
``
Maxim
''
restaurant
in
Haifa
,
Israel
.


21
people
were
killed
in
the
attack
and
51
were
injured
.


Among
the
victims
were
two
families
and
four
children
,
including
a
two-month-old
baby
.


The
restaurant
,
which
is
located
at
the
seafront
near
the
southern
boundary
of
the
city
of
Haifa
,
was
frequently
attended
by
both
Arab
and
Jewish
local
populations
,
and
was
widely
seen
as
a
symbol
of
peaceful
coexistence
in
Haifa
.


Militant
organization
Islamic
Jihad
claimed
responsibility
for
the
attack
.


It
was
condemned
by
Palestinian
President
Yasser
Arafat
.


The
restaurant
's
interior
was
destroyed
by
the
blast
(
it
was
completely
rebuilt
seven
months
after
the
attack
)
.


The
Rif
Dimashq
clashes
were
a
series
of
unrests
and
armed
clashes
in
and
around
Damascus
,
the
capital
of
Syria
,
from
November
2011
till
a
stalemate
in
March
2012
.


The
violence
was
part
of
the
wider
early
insurgency
phase
of
the
Syrian
Civil
War
.


Large
pro-government
and
anti-government
protests
took
place
in
the
suburbs
and
center
of
Damascus
,
with
the
situation
escalating
when
members
of
the
Free
Syrian
Army
started
attacking
military
targets
in
November
.


It
is
claimed
that
in
January
2012
,
parts
of
rural
Damascus
and
the
Damascus
suburbs
started
to
fall
under
opposition
control
.


On
27
January
2012
,
the
Syrian
Army
launched
a
military
operation
which
retook
the
Damascus
suburbs
and
the
town
of
Zabadani
with
the
offensive
ending
on
11
February
.


However
,
fighting
still
continued
,
when
on
15
February
FSA
fighters
were
seen
on
the
streets
of
a
district
in
the
Damascus
centre
,
trying
to
recruit
and
mingling
with
opposition
protesters
.


A
few
anti-government
protests
were
still
ongoing
after
the
army
offensive
.


On
12
March
2012
,
major
clashes
were
reported
in
central
Damascus
between
the
FSA
and
the
Syrian
Army
for
the
first
time
.


By
April
2012
a
fragile
cease-fire
was
brokered
by
the
UN
peace
envoy
Kofi
Annan
.


However
,
following
the
cease
fire
collapse
,
by
July
2012
,
rebels
erupted
again
into
most
Damascus
suburbs
and
rural
areas
around
the
city
,
launching
the
Battle
of
Damascus
,
also
known
as
Operation
Damascus
Volcano
.


The
1978
Ice
Hockey
World
Championships
took
place
in
Prague
,
Czechoslovakia
from
26
April
to
14
May
.


Eight
teams
took
part
,
with
each
team
playing
each
other
once
in
the
first
round
,
and
then
the
four
best
teams
meeting
in
a
new
round
.


This
was
the
45th
World
Championships
,
and
also
the
56th
European
Championships
.


The
USSR
won
for
the
fifteenth
time
,
narrowly
defeating
the
incumbent
Czechoslovaks
.


On
the
final
day
,
there
was
essentially
a
gold
medal
game
,
and
a
bronze
medal
game
.


The
Soviets
played
the
Czechoslovaks
and
needed
to
win
by
at
least
two
to
win
the
Championship
.


They
took
a
three
nothing
lead
,
and
hung
to
win
by
two
,
capturing
gold
by
being
even
head
to
head
with
the
Czechoslovaks
,
but
having
a
cumulative
two
goal
advantage
against
everyone
else
.


Canada
and
Sweden
came
into
the
final
game
even
,
so
the
winner
would
claim
the
bronze
.


Pat
Hickey
scored
with
a
minute
left
in
the
game
to
give
Canada
a
three
to
two
victory
,
and
the
medal
.


Because
of
the
allowance
of
professionals
from
the
NHL
into
the
tournament
,
a
peculiar
(
and
new
)
situation
arose
during
this
year
's
tournament
.


The
Minnesota
North
Stars
had
players
representing
Canada
(

,
Sweden
(
3
)
,
and
the
United
States
(

.


Hezbollah
involvement
in
the
Syrian
Civil
War
has
been
substantial
since
the
beginning
of
armed
insurgency
phase
of
the
Syrian
Civil
War
,
and
turned
into
active
support
and
troop
deployment
from
2012
onwards
.


By
2014
,
Hezbollah
involvement
begun
to
turn
steady
in
support
of
Syrian
Ba'athist
Government
forces
across
Syria
.


Hezbollah
deployed
several
thousand
fighters
in
Syria
and
by
2015
lost
up
to
1,500
fighters
in
combat
.


Hezbollah
has
also
been
very
active
to
prevent
rebel
penetration
from
Syria
to
Lebanon
,
being
one
of
the
most
active
forces
in

.


In
the
past
,
Hezbollah
has
served
a
strategic
arm
of
Iran
in
the
region
,
allegedly
playing
a
key
role
in
the
Iran–Israel
and
Iran–Saudi
Arabia
proxy
conflicts
in
the
middle
east
.


In
a
number
of
occasions
,
Hezbollah
weapon
convoys
in
Syria
and
Syrian-Lebanese
border
areas
were
attacked
,
with
Israel
being
the
main
suspected
party
behind
most
such
attacks
,
though
Israel
did
not
claim
responsibility
except
for
the
March
2017
Israel–Syria

conducted
the
accident
investigation
and
published
a
final
report
on
Tuesday
,
February

,
2010
,
which
found
the
probable
cause
to
be
the
pilots
'
inappropriate
response
to
the

warnings
.


As
of

,
Flight
3407
is
the
most
recent
aviation
incident
resulting
in
mass
casualties
involving
a
U.S.-based
airline
.


Families
of
the
accident
victims
lobbied
the
U.S.
Congress
to
enact
more
stringent
regulations
for
regional
carriers
,
and
to
improve
the
scrutiny
of
safe
operating

UTAGE
Flight
141
was
a
chartered
international
passenger
flight
operated
by
Guinean
regional
airline
Union
des
Transports
Aériens
de
Guinée
,
flying
from
Cotonou
Airport
in
Benin
's
capital
Cotonou
to
Kufra
Airport
in
Kufra
,
Libya
.


On
Christmas
2003
the
aircraft
crashed
in
the
Bight
of
Benin
,
killing
at
least
144
people
,
most
of
them
Lebanese
.


Shortly

team
.


Some
of
them
were
pronounced
dead
upon

was
an
ex-American

Boeing
727-223
,
3X-GDO
.

The
final
report
,
which
was
published
by
France
's
Bureau
d'Enquêtes
et
d'Analyses
pour
la
Sécurité
de
l'Aviation
Civile
,
concluded
that
the
crash
occurred
due
to
airplane
overload
,
as
the
plane
's
actual
weight
exceeded
its
maximum
weight
capacity
,
thus
decreasing
its
performance
,
especially
when
taking
off
.


Flight
141
did
take
off
,
but
because
it
took
too
long
for
it
to
achieve
altitude
,
the
plane
hit
a
localizer
building
and
plunged
to
the
ocean
.


The
report
also
blamed
the
airport
's
lack
of
facilities
.


This
was
the
100th
aviation
accident
involving
the
Boeing
727
.


Currently
,
it
is
held
as
the
deadliest

aviation
history
and
the
11th
worst
accident
involving
the
Boeing

The
Up
All
Night
Tour

the
first
headlining
concert
tour
by
English-Irish
boy
band
One
Direction
,
in
support
of
their
debut
studio
album
,
``
Up
All
Night

after
being
formed
in
the
seventh
series
of
``
The
X

''
and
being

The
concert
tour
was
announced
in
September
2011
,
with
the
initial
dates
for
UK
and
Ireland
being
revealed
.


The
tour
eventually
expanded
to
Oceania

with
the
band
playing
54
shows
in
total
.


The
setlist
encompassed
songs
from
One
Direction
's
debut

five
covers
.


Critics
commended
One
Direction
's
singing
abilities
and
stage

,
and
the
production
of
the
show
.


The
tour
was
commercially

International
Centre
was
made
for
``
''
,
which
was
released

.


The
DVD
was
a
commercial
success
,
topping
the
charts
in
twenty-five
countries
,
and
made
chart
history
in
the
US
.


By

The
Harrow
and
Wealdstone
rail
crash
was
a
three-train
collision
at
Harrow
and
Wealdstone
station
in
Wealdstone
,
Middlesex
(
now
Greater
London
)
during
the
morning
rush
hour
of
8
October
1952
;
112
were
killed
and
340
injured
(
88
of
these
being
detained
in
hospital
)
;
it
remains
the
worst
peacetime
rail
crash
in
the
United
Kingdom
.


An
overnight
express
train
from
Perth
crashed
at
speed
into
the
rear
of
a
local
passenger
train
standing
at
a
platform
at
the
station
.


The
wreckage
blocked
adjacent
lines
and
was
struck
within
seconds
by
a
``
double-headed
''
express
train
travelling
north
at
.


The
Ministry
of
Transport
report
on
the
crash
found
that
the
driver
of
the
Perth
train
had
passed
a
caution
signal
and
two
danger
signals
before
colliding
with
the
local
train
.


The
reason
for
this
was
never
established
,
as
both
the
driver
and
the
fireman
of
the
Perth
train
were
killed
in
the
accident
.


The
accident
accelerated
the
introduction
of
Automatic
Warning
System
–
by
the
time
the
report
on
the
accident
had
been
published
,
British
Railways
had
agreed
to
a
five-year
plan
to
install
the
system
to
give
drivers
an
in-cab
audible
and
visual
warning
of
being
about
to
pass
a
distant
signal
at
caution
,
actuated
by
magnets
between
the
rails
.


The
Get
Lucky
Tour
was
a
2010
concert
tour
by
British
singer-songwriter
and
guitarist
Mark
Knopfler
,
promoting
the
release
of
his
album
``
Get
Lucky
''
.


The
tour
consisted
of
two
legs
:
North
America
and
Europe
.


The
North
American
leg
started
on
8
April
2010
in
Seattle
,
Washington
,
and
included
28
concerts
in
27
cities
,
ending
on
9
May
2010
in
Albany
,
New
York
.


The
European
leg
started
on
9
September
2010
in
London
,
and
included
59
concerts
in
51
cities
,
ending
on
31
July
2010
in
Ávila
,
Spain
.


The
tour
included
a
six-night
run
at
the
Royal
Albert
Hall
in
London
.


The
tour
lineup
for
the
North
American
leg
included
Mark
Knopfler
(
guitar
,
vocals
)
,
Guy
Fletcher
(
keyboards

,
Danny
Cummings
(

)
,
Richard

,
and
Michael
McGoldrick

.


For
the
European
leg
of
the
tour
,
John
McCusker
(
violin

joined
the
band
.


When
Dream
and
Tour
Unite
was
a
tour
by
progressive
metal/rock
band
Dream
Theater
promoting
their
first
album
,
``
When
Dream
and
Day
Unite
''
.


After
the
album
's
release
,
the
band
were
faced
with
the
harsh
reality
of
the
poor
deal
made
with
their
label
,
Mechanic
Records
.


Mechanic
ended
up
breaking
the
majority
of
the
financial
promises
they
had
made
to
Dream
Theater
prior
to
signing
their
contract
,
so
the
band
was
restricted
to
playing
around
New
York
City
.


The
promotional
tour
for
the
album
consisted
of
just
five
concerts
,
all
of
which
were
relatively
local
.


Their
first
show
was
at
Sundance
in
Bay
Shore
,
New
York
opening
for
the
classic
rock
power
trio
Zebra
.


After
the
fourth
show
,
Charlie
Dominici
was
let
go
because
the
band
was
starting
to
feel
the
limitations
of
his
voice
based
upon
the
vocal
style
they
wanted
.


The
band
was
looking
for
more
of
a
Bruce
Dickinson/Geoff
Tate
type
of
singer
,
and
his
stage
presence
was
not
what
they
wanted
for
a
front
man
.


Shortly
after
,
however
,
the
band
Marillion
asked
Dream
Theater
to
open
for
them
at
a
gig
at
the
Ritz
in
New
York
,
so
Charlie
Dominici
was
given
the
opportunity
to
perform
one
last
time
.


It
would
be
another
two
years
before
Dream
Theater
had
a
replacement
vocalist
.


the
miami
showband
killings
(
also
called
the
miami
showband
massacre
)
was
an
attack
on
31
july
1975
by
the
ulster
volunteer
force
(
uvf
)
,
a
loyalist
paramilitary
group
.


It
took
place
on
the
A1
road
at
Buskhill
in
County
Down
,
Northern
Ireland
.


Five
people
were
killed
,
including
three
members
of
The
Miami
Showband
,
who
were
one
of
Ireland
's
most
popular
cabaret
bands
.


The
band
was
travelling
home
to
Dublin
late
at
night
after
a
performance
in
Banbridge
.


Halfway
to
Newry
,
their
minibus
was
stopped
at
what
appeared
to
be
a
military
checkpoint
where
gunmen
in
British
Army
uniforms
ordered
them
to
line
up
by
the
roadside
.


At
least
four
of
the
gunmen
were
soldiers
from
the
British
Army
's
Ulster
Defence
Regiment
(
UDR
)
,
and
all
were
members
of
the
UVF
.


Two
of
the
gunmen
,
both
soldiers
,
died
when
the
time
bomb
they
were
hiding
on
the
minibus
exploded
.


The
other
gunmen
then
opened
fire
on
the
dazed
band
members
,
killing
three
and
wounding
two
.


It
is
believed
that
the
bomb
was
meant
to
explode
en
route
,
so
that
the
victim
band
members
would
appear
to
be
IRA
bomb-smugglers
and
stricter
security
measures
would
be
established
at
the
border
.


Two
serving
UDR
soldiers
and
one
former
UDR
soldier
were
found
guilty
of
the
murders
and
received
life
sentences
;
they
were
released
in
1998
.


Those
responsible
for
the
attack
belonged
to
the
Glenanne
gang
,
a
secret
alliance
of
loyalist
militants
,
rogue
police
officers
,
and
UDR
soldiers
.


There
are
also
allegations
that
British
military
intelligence
agents
were
involved
.


According
to
former
Intelligence
Corps
agent
Captain
Fred
Holroyd
,
the
killings
were
organised
by
British
intelligence
officer
Robert
Nairac
,
together
with
the
UVF
's
Mid-Ulster
Brigade
and
its
commander
Robin
``
The
Jackal
''
Jackson
.


The
Historical
Enquiries
Team
investigated
the
killings
and
released
their
report
to
the
victims
'
families
in
December
2011
.


It
confirmed
that
Jackson
was
linked
to
the
attack
by
fingerprints
.


Documentary
evidence
,
published
in
2015
,
clears
Robert
Nairac
of
complicity
as
it
determines
he
was
not
in
Northern
Ireland
when
the
ambush
took
place
.


The
massacre
dealt
a
blow
to
Northern
Ireland
's
live
music
scene
,
which
had
brought
young
Catholics
and
Protestants
together
.


In
a
report
published
in
the
``
Sunday
Mirror
''
in
1999
,
Colin
Wills
called
the
Miami
Showband
attack
``
one
of
the
worst
atrocities
in
the
30-year
history
of
the
Troubles
''
.


``
Irish
Times
''
diarist
Frank
McNally
summed
up
the
massacre
as
``
an
incident
that
encapsulated
all
the
madness
of
the
time
''
.


The
Battle
of
the
Basque
Roads
,
also
known
as
the
Battle
of
Aix
Roads
(
French
:
``
Bataille
de
l'île
d'Aix
''
,
also
``
Affaire
des
brûlots
''
,
rarely
``
Bataille
de
la
rade
des
Basques
''
)
,
was
a
major
naval
battle
of
the
Napoleonic
Wars
,
fought
in
the
narrow
Basque
Roads
at
the
mouth
of
the
Charente
River
on
the
Biscay
coast
of
France
.


The
battle
,
which
lasted
from
11–24
April
1809
,
was
unusual
in
that
it
pitted
a
hastily-assembled
squadron
of
small
and
unorthodox
British
Royal
Navy
warships
against
the
main
strength
of
the
French
Atlantic
Fleet
,
the
circumstances
dictated
by
the
cramped
,
shallow
coastal
waters
in
which
the
battle
was
fought
.


The
battle
is
also
notorious
for
its
controversial
political
aftermath
in
both
Britain
and
France
.


In
February
1809
the
French
Atlantic
Fleet
,
blockaded
in
Brest
on
the
Breton
coast
by
the
British
Channel
Fleet
,
attempted
to
break
out
into
the
Atlantic
and
reinforce
the
garrison
of
Martinique
.


Sighted
and
chased
by
British
blockade
squadrons
,
the
French
were
unable
to
escape
the
Bay
of
Biscay
and
eventually
anchored
in
the
Basque
Roads
,
near
the
naval
base
of
Rochefort
.


There
they
were
kept
under
observation
during
March
by
the
British
fleet
under
the
dour
Admiral
Lord
Gambier
.


The
Admiralty
,
desiring
an
attack
on
the
French
fleet
,
ordered
Lord
Cochrane
,
an
outspoken
and
popular
junior
captain
,
to
lead
an
attack
,
over
the
objections
of
a
number
of
senior
officers
.


Cochrane
organised
an
inshore
squadron
of
fireships
and
bomb
vessels
,
including
a
converted
frigate
,
and
personally
led
this
force
into
Basque
Roads
on
the
evening
of
11
April
.


The
attack
caused
little
direct
damage
,
but
in
the
narrow
waters
of
the
channel
the
fireships
panicked
the
sailors
of
the
French
fleet
and
most
of
their
ships
grounded
and
were
left
immobile
.


Cochrane
expected
Gambier
to
follow
his
attack
with
the
main
fleet
,
which
could
then
destroy
the
vulnerable
French
force
,
but
Gambier
refused
.


Cochrane
continued
the
battle
over
the
next
several
days
,
successfully
destroying
several
French
ships
,
but
with
little
support
from
Gambier
.


This
allowed
most
of
the
French
fleet
to
refloat
and
retreat
up
the
Charente
to
safety
.


Gambier
recalled
Cochrane
on
14
April
and
sent
him
back
to
Britain
,
withdrawing
most
of
the
inshore
squadron
at
the
same
time
,
although
scattered
fighting
continued
until
24
April
.


The
increasingly
marginalised
French
fleet
was
badly
damaged
and
trapped
in
its
home
ports
;
several
captains
were
court-martialed
for
cowardice
and
one
was
shot
.


In
Britain
the
battle
was
celebrated
as
a
victory
,
but
many
in
the
Navy
were
dissatisfied
with
Gambier
's
behaviour
and
Cochrane
used
his
position
as
a
Member
of
Parliament
to
publicly
protest
Gambier
's
leadership
.


Incensed
,
Gambier
requested
a
court-martial
to
disprove
Cochrane
's
accusations
and
the
admiral
's
political
allies
ensured
that
the
jury
was
composed
of
his
supporters
.


After
bitter
and
argumentative
proceedings
Gambier
was
exonerated
of
any
culpability
for
failings
during
the
battle
.


Cochrane
's
naval
career
was
ruined
,
although
the
irrepressible
officer
remained
a
prominent
figure
in
Britain
for
decades
to
come
.


Historians
have
almost
unanimously
condemned
Gambier
for
his
failure
to
support
Cochrane
;
even
Napoleon
opined
that
he
was
an
``
imbécile
''
.


The
Capture
of
Malacca
in
1511
occurred
when
the
governor
of
Portuguese
India
Afonso
de
Albuquerque
conquered
the
city
of
Malacca
in
1511
.


The
port
city
of
Malacca
controlled
the
narrow
,
strategic
Strait
of
Malacca
,
through
which
all
seagoing
trade
between
China
and
India
was
concentrated
.


The
capture
of
Malacca
was
the
result
of
a
plan
by
King
Manuel
I
of
Portugal
,
who
since
1505
had
intended
to
beat
the
Castillians
to
the
Far-East
,
and
Albuquerque
's
own
project
of
establishing
firm
foundations
for
Portuguese
India
,
alongside
Hormuz
,
Goa
and
Aden
,
to
ultimately
control
trade
and
thwart
Muslim
shipping
in
the
Indian
Ocean
.


Having
set
sail
from
Cochin
in
April
1511
,
the
expedition
would
not
have
been
able
to
turn
around
due
to
contrary
monsoon
winds
.


Had
the
enterprise
failed
,
the
Portuguese
could
not
hope
for
reinforcements
and
would
have
been
unable
to
return
to
their
bases
in
India
.


It
was
the
farthest
territorial
conquest
in
the
history
of
mankind
until
then
.


The
Carthage
nursing
home
shooting
was
a
mass
murder
that
occurred
on
March
29
,
2009
,
when
a
gunman
opened
fire
at
Pinelake
Health
and
Rehabilitation
,
a
120-bed
nursing
home
in
Carthage
,
North
Carolina
.


The
shooter
,
45-year-old
Robert
Stewart
,
killed
eight
people
,
including
a
nurse
at
the
home
,
and
wounded
a
ninth
.


He
was
shot
and
apprehended
by
the
responding
police
officer
,
who
was
also
wounded
by
gunfire
.


Stewart
was
said
to
have
intended
to
kill
his
estranged
wife
,
a
nurse
at
the
nursing
home
,
who
had
hidden
and
survived
the
shooting
unharmed
.


Initially
charged
with
first-degree
murder
,
Stewart
was
tried
in
2011
and
convicted
on
eight
counts
of
second-degree
murder
.


He
was
sentenced
to
multiple
sentences
,
totaling
179
years
,
four
months
,
and
20
days
.

Abdhir
and
other
Malaysian
terrorists
or
high-ranking
members
of
the
BIFF
.


Originally
a
mission
to
serve
arrest
warrants
for
high-ranking
terrorists
,
it
led
to
the
deaths
of
44
members
of
SAF
,
18
from
MILF
and
BIFF
,
and
five
civilians
,
and
the
death
of
Zulkifli
Abdhir
confirmed
by
the
FBI
and
the
PNP
at
6:30
p.m.
of
February
4
,
2015
,
due
to
a
matching
DNA
result
.


He
was
one
of
FBI
's
most
wanted
terrorists
.


Getulio
Napeñas
,
the
relieved
SAF
commander
,
estimates
about
250
deaths
from
his
assumption
that
each
SAF
snipers
may
have
taken
down
at
least
20
opponents
from
the
combined
MILF
,
BIFF
,
and
private
militias
during
the
encounter
although
this
was
not
confirmed
and
was
met
with
skepticism
since
aside
from
the
fact
that
there
was
no
actual
body
count
,
there
is
no
acceptable
level
of
evidence
to
prove
his
claim
.


Napenas
'
estimate
was
also
debunked
by
the
MILF
and
by
the
local
government
of
Mamasapano
.


The
mission
itself
was
declared
successful
since
the
target
was
neutralized
but
the
ensuing
firefight
resulted
in
a
tactical
victory
of
MILF
forces
against
the
PNP
SAF
.


The
severity
of
the
policemen
's
situation
prompted
the
government
peace
panel
to
intervene
and
requested
a
ceasefire
from
the
MILF
.


the
armed
forces
of
the
philippines
also
conducted
a
rescue
operation
to
save
the
remaining
29
saf
survivors
who
were
encircled
by
the
enemies
.


The
operation
caught
the
attention
of
many
for
the
relatively
high
number
of
police
officers
killed
.


The
clash
has
been
dubbed
as
the
biggest
loss
of
government
elite
force
in
history
.


The
mission
was
called
Oplan
Exodus
,
initially
misattributed
as
Oplan
Wolverine
by
the
local
media
.


Oplan
Wolverine
refers
to
three
of
the
other
nine
prior
operation
attempts
targeting
Marwan
;
Oplan
Wolverine
1
,
2
and
3
launched
in
December
2012
,
March
and
May
2014
respectively
,
by
the
PNP-SAF
.


The
incident
caused
the
Philippine
Congress
to
halt
the
passage
of
the
Bangsamoro
Basic
Law
,
effectively
endangering
the
peace
process
between
the
government
and
the
MILF
.


The
Federal
Bureau
of
Investigation
later
participated
in
identifying
Zulkifli
's
body
.


The
Capture
of
Afula
and
Beisan
occurred
on
20
September
1918
,
during
the
Battle
of
Sharon
which
together
with
the
Nablus
,
formed
the
set
piece
Battle
of
Megiddo
fought
during
the
last
months
of
the
Sinai
and
Palestine
Campaign
of
the
First
World
War
.


During
the
cavalry
phase
of
the
Battle
of
Sharon
,
the
4th
Cavalry
Division
of
the
Desert
Mounted
Corps
attacked
and
captured
the
main
communications
hub
at
Afula
,
located
in
the
centre
of
the
Esdraelon
Plain
(
also
known
as
the
Jezreel
Valley
and
the
plain
of
Armageddon
)
,
and
Beisan
on
the
plain
's
eastern
edge
near
the
Jordan
River
,
some
behind
the
front
line
in
the
Judean
Hills
.


Infantry
attacks
by
the
British
Empires
XXI
Corps
had
begun
the
Battle
of
Sharon
on
19
September
,
along
an
almost
continuous
trench
line
from
the
Mediterranean
across
the
Plain
of
Sharon
and
into
the
foothills
of
the
Judean
Hills
.


These
attacks
captured
the
Ottoman
front
line
at
Tulkarm
,
Tabsor
,
and
Arara
,
in
the
process
outflanking
and
decimating
the
Ottoman
Eighth
Army
on
the
coast
.


during
the
attack
on
tulkarm
,
the
infantry
created
a
gap
in
the
ottoman
front
line
defences
,
through
which
cavalry
from
general
edmund
allenby
's
egyptian
expeditionary
force
(
eef
)
rode
north
.


The
three
cavalry
divisions
in
the
Desert
Mounted
Corps
successfully
captured
the
Ottoman
Seventh
and
Eighth
Armies
'
lines
of
communication
across
the
Esdraelon
Plain
from
their
headquarters
in
the
Judean
Hills
.


The
Desert
Mounted
Corps
began
the
advance
riding
up
the
Plain
of
Sharon
to
Liktera
,
on
19
September
where
they
attacked
and
captured
an
entrenched
line
barring
their
advance
.


subsequently
,
the
corps
crossed
the
mount
carmel
range
by
the
unk
pass
and
the
northern
unk
pass
,
during
the
night
of
19/20
september
.


As
the
4th
Cavalry
Division
rode
out
across
the
Esdraelon
Plain
on
the
morning
of
20
September
,
towards
their
primary
objective
;
the
main
communications
hub
at
Afula
,
they
attacked
and
captured
a
force
sent
from
Yildirim
Army
Group
headquarters
at
Nazareth
,
to
hold
and
bar
the
Musmus
Pass
,
which
had
failed
to
get
into
position
.


Afula
was
captured
by
units
from
both
the
5th
and
the
4th
Cavalry
Divisions
shortly
after
.


Leaving
the
5th
Cavalry
Division
and
one
regiments
at
Afula
,
the
4th
Cavalry
Division
advanced
to
capture
Beisan
and
later
in
the
day
,
the
regiment
advanced
directly
from
Afula
to
occupy
the
railway
bridges
at
Jisr
el
Mejamie
,
across
the
Jordan
and
Yarmuk
Rivers
.


The
capture
of
Jenin
on
the
southern
edge
of
the
Esdraelon
Plain
,
also
blocked
the
main
line
of
retreat
to
Damascus
from
the
Judean
Hills
.


The
General
Headquarters
of
the
Yildirim
Army
Group
commanded
by
General
Otto
Liman
von
Sanders
at
Nazareth
was
captured
the
next
day
,
and
Haifa
two
days
later
.


Several
days
later
while
garrisoning
Beisan
,
the
4th
Cavalry
Division
advanced
southwards
down
the
Jordan
River
to
close
a
long
gap
,
through
which
the
retreating
remnants
of
the
Seventh
and
Eighth
Armies
had
been
escaping
.


They
successfully
attacked
and
captured
several
fords
during
23
and
24
September
,
to
completely
cut
off
all
remaining
Ottoman
soldiers
in
the
Judean
Hills
.


By
the
end
of
the
month
,
one
Ottoman
army
had
been
destroyed
,
while
the
remnants
of
two
others
were
in
retreat
to
Damascus
after
the
German
rearguard
at
Samakh
was
captured
by
Australian
Light
Horsemen
on
25
September
.


Damascus
was
captured
on
1
October
,
and
by
the
time
the
Armistice
of
Mudros
between
the
Allies
and
the
Ottoman
Empire
was
signed
at
the
end
of
October
,
fighting
for
Aleppo
was
underway

,
at
a
time
when

expeditionary
force
(
bef
)
were
attempting
to
retreat
through
the
pas-de-calais
region
during
the
battle
of
dunkirk
.


Soldiers
of
the
2nd
Battalion
,
the
Royal
Norfolk
Regiment
,
had
become
isolated
from
their
unit
.


They
occupied
and
defended
a
farmhouse
against
an
attack
by
Waffen-SS
forces
in
the
village
of
Le
Paradis
.


After
running
out
of
ammunition
,
the
defenders
surrendered
to
the
German
troops
.


The
Germans
led
them
across
the
road
to
a
wall
where
they
were
murdered
by
machine
gun
fire
.


Ninety-seven
British
troops
were
killed
.


Two
survived
,
with
injuries
,
and
hid
until
they
were
captured
by
German
forces
several
days
later
.


After
the
war
,
Fritz
Knöchlein
was
located
,
tried
and
convicted
by
a
war
crimes
court
,
with
the
two
survivors
acting
as
witnesses
against
him
.


For
his
part
in
the
massacre
,
Knöchlein
was
executed
in
1949

Cyclone
Arthur
(
RSMC
Nadi
designation
:
08F
,
JTWC
designation
:
09P
)
was
the
eighth
tropical
depression
and
fourth
tropical
cyclone
of
the
2006–07
South
Pacific
cyclone
season
.


Forming
as
tropical
depression
on
January
25
,
Arthur
rapidly
intensified
into
a
strong
Category
2
cyclone
on
the
Australian
intensity
scale
according
to
the
Regional
Specialized
Meteorological
Centre
in
Nadi
,
Fiji
.


the
joint
typhoon
warning
center
assessed
the
storm
to
have
peaked
as
a
minimal
category
1
cyclone
.


Shortly
after
peaking
in
intensity
,
the
cyclone
began
to
deteriorate
due
to
unfavorable
conditions
.


Quickly
moving
towards
the
east-southeast
,
the
Arthur
began
to
undergo
an
extratropical
transition
.


After
turning
towards
the
southeast
,
the
center
of
circulation
was
almost
fully
exposed
due
to
strong
wind
shear
.


However
,
Arthur
briefly
re-strengthened
late
on
January
26
before
becoming
extratropical
the
next
day
.


Tropical
Cyclone
Arthur
affected
several
small
islands
during
its
existence
.


French
Polynesia
observed
the
most
noteworthy
effects
from
the
storm
,
where
several
landslides
damaged
a
few
homes
.


The
2008
Minsk
bombing
took
place
just
after
midnight
on
4
July
2008
,
in
Minsk
,
Belarus
and
wounded
54
people
.


The
explosion
happened
near
the
Hero
City
Memorial
at
a
concert
to
celebrate
Belarus
'
independence
.


The
concert
had
been
attended
by
Belarus
'
President
,
Alexander
Lukashenko
,
who
was
not
hurt
and
who
officials
said
was
not
the
target
.


A
second
,
larger
bomb
was
discovered
before
the
blast
.


No
clear
motive
for
the
blast
has
been
revealed
.


However
,
Belarusian
authorities
detained
four
members
of
the
White
Legion
,
a
nationalist
group
,
in
the
days
following
the
attack
.


During
the
investigation
,
were
interrogated
over
a
dozen
leaders
of
opposition
.


Also
,
the
explosion
was
the
pretext
for
the
mass
taking
of
fingerprints
of
almost
the
entire
male
population
of
Belarus
.


The
probable
perpetrators
of
the
explosion
were
detained
during
the
investigation
of
the
terrorist
attack
in

.


Surinam
Airways
Flight
764
was
an
international
scheduled
passenger
flight
from
Amsterdam
Airport
Schiphol
in
the
Netherlands
to
Paramaribo-Zanderij
International
Airport
in
Suriname
on
a
Surinam
Airways
DC-8-62
.


On
Wednesday
7
June
1989
the
flight
crashed
during
approach
to
Paramaribo-Zanderij
,
killing
176
of
the
187
on
board
.


It
is
the
deadliest
aviation
disaster
in
Suriname
's
history
.


Investigation
revealed
significant
deficiencies
in
the
crew
's
training
and
judgement
.


They
knowingly
attempted
to
land
using
an
inappropriate
navigation
signal
and
ignored
alarms
warning
them
of
an
impending
crash
.


The
safety
issues
stemming
from
the
incident
were
of
such
concern
that
the
United
States
National
Transportation
Safety
Board
(
NTSB
)
issued
safety
recommendations
to
the
Federal
Aviation
Administration
(
FAA
)
.


The
2004
Grozny
stadium
bombing
occurred
on
9
May
2004
when
a
bomb
exploded
in
the
Dynamo
stadium
in
the
Chechen
capital
,
Grozny
,
killing
10
people
including
the
republic
's
president
Akhmad
Kadyrov
and
another
100
people
were
wounded
.


Kadyrov
's
election
was
considered
by
many
to
be
by
a
fraudulent
vote
.


The
explosion
was
caused
by
a
bomb
planted
underneath
the
concrete
floor
of
the
VIP
podium
and
occurred
at
10:35am
during
a
parade
and
concert
in
Groznyy
celebrating
the
59th
anniversary
of
the
defeat
of
Germany
in
World
War
2
.


The
blast
tore
a
hole
in
the
section
designated
for
dignitaries
.


It
was
not
clear
if
the
explosion
was
specifically
targeting
Kadyrov
or
whether
it
would
have
occurred
regardless
of
his
presence
,
as
he
was
not
officially
scheduled
to
be
at
this
event
.


Khussein
Isayev
,
chairman
of
the
Republic
's
state
council
,
and
Adlan
Khasanov
,
a
reporter
for
Reuters
,
were
also
killed
in
the
blast
.


Col.
Gen.
Valery
Baranov
,
the
commander
of
the
Russian
military
in
the
northern
Caucasus
was
gravely
wounded
.


although
estimates
of
total
casualties
varied
,
at
least
ten
people
were
killed
and
around
fifty
more
injured
.


The
numbers
include
many
civilians
and
WW2
veterans
who
were
also
attending
the
celebrations
.


Officials
believe
that
the
blast
was
detonated
by
remote
control
and
was
intentionally
installed
below
the
VIP
section
.


The
bomb
may
have
been
planted
some
time
before
during
the
recent
renovations
to
the
stadium
.


Preliminary
reports
suggest
that
the
bomb
was
equivalent
to
one
ton
of
TNT
.


The
location
of
the
bomb
made
it
impossible
for
existing
equipment
to
detect
.


The
type
of
explosive
appeared
identical
to
one
used
to
blow
up
the
military
parade
two
years
ago
in
the
Dagestani
city
of
Kaspiysk
.


Rescue
workers
prevented
two
other
blasts
in
the
stadium
.


They
were
able
to
defuse
another
landmine
and
an
additional
explosive
device
equipped
with
a
timer
set
to
go
off
30
minutes
after
the
first
explosion
.


On
May
12
another
explosive
device
was
found
in
the
half-ruined
Dynamo
Stadium
.


The
device
consisted
of
TNT
charges
and
pieces
of
metal
.


It
was
unclear
if
the
device
had
been
planted
recently
or
a
long
time
ago
.


Rebel
leader
Shamil
Basayev
claimed
that
he
was
involved
in
and
had
organized
the
blast
.


The
attack
may
have
been
intended
to
sow
panic
and
disorder
among
the
Chechen
leadership
.


Initial
investigations
focused
on
the
security
staff
at
the
stadium
and
the
builders
who
took
part
in
the
renovations
of
the
stadium
.


Investigators
believe
that
insufficient
training
and
organization
of
the
security
staff
were
at
fault
for
allowing
the
attack
.


Officials
detained
at
least
five
individuals
for
potential
involvement
in
the
attack
,
including
Ibragim
Musayev
,
who
was
also
involved
in
the
hostage-taking
raid
of
the
Dubrovka
Theatre
and
the
bomb
attack
near
a
McDonald
's
in
Moscow
.


Investigators
had
given
a
more
specific
list
of
suspects
who
were
under
investigation
to
the
Russian
Duma
.


The
Russian
appointed
Prime
Minister
,
Sergei
Abramov
will
serve
as
President
until
new
elections
are
held
sometime
before
September
,
as
stipulated
by
the
republic
's
constitution
.


The
attack
served
a
blow
to
Putin
and
his
strategy
for
ending
the
conflict
in
Chechnya
.


On
August
5
,
Interfax
reported
that
three
suspects
had
been
arrested
in
connection
with
the
attack
,
two
of
whom
had
already
confessed
to
the
crime
.


One
man
was
arrested
later
than
the
other
two
and
was
said
to
have
provided
investigators
with
useful
information
.

one
of
Australia
's
biggest
tourist
drawcards
,
with
the
parade
and
dance

international
and
domestic

It
is
New

second-largest
annual

in
terms
of
economic
impact
,
generating
an
annual
income
of
about
30
million
for
the
state
.


The
event
grew
from
gay

parades
held
annually
since
1978
,
when
numerous
participants
had
been
arrested
by
New
South
Wales
Police
.

Reflecting
changes
since
the
first

The
breakup
of
Yugoslavia
occurred
as
a
result
of
a
series
of
political
upheavals
and
conflicts
during
the
early
1990s
.


After
a
period
of
political
and
economic
crisis
in
the
1980s
,
constituent
republics
of
the
Socialist
Federal
Republic
of
Yugoslavia
split
apart
,
but
the
unresolved
issues
caused
bitter
inter-ethnic
Yugoslav
wars
.


The
wars
primarily
affected
Bosnia
and
Herzegovina
,
neighbouring
parts
of
Croatia
and
some
years
later
,
Kosovo
.


After
the
Allied
victory
in
World
War
II
,
Yugoslavia
was
set
up
as
a
federation
of
six
republics
,
with
borders
drawn
along
ethnic
and
historical
lines
:
Bosnia
and
Herzegovina
,
Croatia
,
Macedonia
,
Montenegro
,
Serbia
,
and
Slovenia
.


In
addition
,
two
autonomous
provinces
were
established
within
Serbia
:
Vojvodina
and
Kosovo
.


Each
of
the
republics
had
its
own
branch
of
the
League
of
Communists
of
Yugoslavia
party
and
a
ruling
elite
,
and
any
tensions
were
solved
on
the
federal
level
.


The
Yugoslav
model
of
state
organisation
,
as
well
as
a
``
middle
way
''
between
planned
and
liberal
economy
,
had
been
a
relative
success
,
and
the
country
experienced
a
period
of
strong
economic
growth
and
relative
political
stability
up
to
the
1980s
,
under
the
rule
of
president-for-life
Josip
Broz
Tito
.


After
his
death
in
1980
,
the
weakened
system
of
federal
government
was
left
unable
to
cope
with
rising
economic
and
political
challenges
.


In
the
1980s
,
Albanians
of
Kosovo
started
to
demand
that
their
autonomous
province
be
granted
the
status
of
a
constituent
republic
,
starting
with
the
1981
protests
.


Ethnic
tensions
between
Albanians
and
Kosovo
Serbs
remained
high
over
the
whole
decade
,
which
resulted
in
the
growth
across
Yugoslavia
of
Serb
opposition
to
the
high
autonomy
of
provinces
and
ineffective
system
of
consensus
at
the
federal
level
,
which
were
seen
as
an
obstacle
for
Serb
interests
.


In
1987
,
Slobodan
Milošević
came
to
power
in
Serbia
,
and
through
a
series
of
populist
moves
acquired
``
de
facto
''
control
over
Kosovo
,
Vojvodina
,
and
Montenegro
,
garnering
a
high
level
of
support
among
Serbs
for
his
centralist
policies
.


Milošević
was
met
with
opposition
by
party
leaders
of
the
western
republics
of
Slovenia
and
Croatia
,
who
also
advocated
greater
democratisation
of
the
country
in
line
with
the
Revolutions
of
1989
in
Eastern
Europe
.


The
League
of
Communists
of
Yugoslavia
dissolved
in
January
1990
along
federal
lines
.


Republican
communist
organisations
became
the
separate
socialist
parties
.


During
1990
,
the
socialists
(
former
communists
)
lost
power
to
ethnic
separatist
parties
in
the
first
multi-party
elections
held
across
the
country
,
except
in
Serbia
and
Montenegro
,
where
Milošević
and
his
allies
won
.


Nationalist
rhetoric
on
all
sides
became
increasingly
heated
.


Between
June
1991
and
April
1992
,
four
republics
declared
independence
(
only
Serbia
and
Montenegro
remained
federated
)
,
but
the
status
of
ethnic
Serbs
outside
Serbia
and
Montenegro
,
and
that
of
ethnic
Croats
outside
Croatia
,
remained
unsolved
.


After
a
string
of
inter-ethnic
incidents
,
the
Yugoslav
Wars
ensued
,
first
in
Croatia
and
then
,
most
severely
,
in
multi-ethnic
Bosnia
and
Herzegovina
.


The
wars
left
long-term
economic
and
political
damage
in
the
region
,
which
are
still
felt
there
decades
later
.


The
FIS
Ski
Jumping
Continental
Cup
is
a
series
of
ski
jumping
competitions
arranged
yearly
by
the
International
Ski
Federation
.


It
is
considered
the
second
level
of
international
ski
jumping
,
ranking
below
the
World
Cup
and
not
counting
Grand
Prix
which
world
top
class
summer
competition
.


Athletes
competing
in
the
Continental
Cup
are
usually
juniors
and
jumpers
fighting
for
a
spot
on
their
nation
's
World
Cup
team
.


Some
jumpers
alternate
between
the
World
Cup
and
the
Continental
Cup
and
therefore
,
the
winner
of
the
Continental
Cup
is
not
necessarily
the
best
jumper
.


International
Ski
Federation
considers
the
last
two
Europa
Cup
seasons
in
1991/92
and
1992/93
where
they
competed
only
in
Europe
and
with
only
European
ski
jumpers
,
as
first
two
continental
cup
season
.


However
,
men
officially
began
first
season
in
1993/94
spreading
,
with
hosts
spreading
from
Europe
to
Asian
and
North
American
ground
.


Competitors
from
United
States
,
Canada
and
Asia
previously
competed
in
their
own
Pacific
Rum
Cup
which
was
canceled
,
joined
with
Europeans
on
the
second
level
of
world
ski
jumping
competition
.


Summer
continental
cup
event
was
first
time
organized
in
1996
,
however
those
summer
events
counted
together
in
joined
overall
winter
ranking
until
2001/02
.


But
from
the
season
2002/03
on
,
summer
events
counts
in
separated
men
's
summer
rankings
.


The
ladies
competition
was
introduced
in
the
2004/05
.


Summer
events
organized
already
in
first
season
like
with
men
counted
together
in
joined
overall
winter
ranking
until
2007/08
.


But
from
the
2008/09
on
,
summer
events
counts
in
separated
ladies
'
summer
rankings
.


Until
the
2010/11
this
was
the
ladies
'
top
international
ski
jumping
competition
and
the
season
later
,
World
Cup
for
ladies
was
introduced
in
2011/12
.


So
far
only
four
individual
an
none
of
the
team
events
in
this
competition
have
been
held
on
ski
flying
hills
:
two
events
in
Ironwood
(
1994
)
and
two
events
in
Vikersund
(
2004
)
.


Higher
competitive
circuits
are
the
World

The
Ekka
is
the
annual
agricultural
show
of
Queensland
,
Australia
.


Its
formal
title
is
the
Royal
Queensland
Show
,
and
it
is
held
at
the
Brisbane
Showgrounds
.


It
was
originally
called
the
Brisbane
Exhibition
,
but
it
is
more
commonly
known
as
the
``
Ekka
''
,
short
for
``
exhibition
''
.


It
is
run
by
The
Royal
National
Agricultural
and
Industrial
Association
of
Queensland
.


The
Ekka
is
Queensland
's
largest
annual
event
,
which
welcomes
an
average
of
400,000
visitors
each
August
.


The
show

entertainment
,
including
the
spectacular
night
program
.


The
Ekka
features
a
sideshow
alley
,
showbag
pavilion
,
and
nightly
fireworks
displays
.


In
2019
,
the
Ekka
will
be
held
from
9–18
August
.


The
significance
of
the
first
exhibition
held
in
1876
was
described
by
locals
as
the
most
important
event
since
the
separation
of
Queensland
from
New
South
Wales
in
1859
.


In
2009
as
part
of
the
Q150
celebrations
,
the
Ekka
was
announced
as
one
of
the
Q150
Icons
of
Queensland
for
its
role
as
an
``
event
and
festival
''
.


On
19
April
1989
,
the
Number
Two
16-inch
gun
turret
of
the
United
States
Navy
battleship
exploded
.


The
explosion
in
the
center
gun
room
killed
47
of
the
turret
's
crewmen
and
severely
damaged
the
gun
turret
itself
.


Two
major
investigations
were
undertaken
into
the
cause
of
the
explosion
,
one
by
the
U.S.
Navy
and
then
one
by
the
Government
Accountability
Office
(
GAO
)
and
Sandia
National
Laboratories
.


The
investigations
produced
conflicting
conclusions
.


The
first
investigation
into
the
explosion
,
conducted
by
the
U.S.
Navy
,
concluded
that
one
of
the
gun
turret
crew
members
,
Clayton
Hartwig
,
who
died
in
the
explosion
,
had
deliberately
caused
it
.


During
the
investigation
,
numerous
leaks
to
the
media
,
later
attributed
to
U.S.
Navy
officers
and
investigators
,
implied
that
Hartwig
and
another
sailor
,
Kendall
Truitt
,
had
engaged
in
a
homosexual
relationship
and
that
Hartwig
had
caused
the
explosion
after
their
relationship
had
soured
.


In
its
report
,
however
,
the
U.S.
Navy
concluded
that
the
evidence
did
not
show
that
Hartwig
was
homosexual
but
that
he
was
suicidal
and
had
caused
the
explosion
with
either
an
electronic
or
chemical
detonator
.


The
victims
'
families
,
the
media
(
CBS
's
60
Minutes
)
,
and
members
of
the
U.S.
Congress
were
sharply
critical
of
the
U.S.
Navy
's
findings
.


the
u.s.
senate
and
u.s.
house
armed
services
committees
both
held
hearings
to
inquire
into
the
navy
's
investigation
and
later
released
reports
disputing
the
u.s.
navy
's
conclusions
.


The
Senate
committee
asked
the
GAO
to
review
the
U.S.
Navy
's
investigation
.


To
assist
the
GAO
,
Sandia
National
Laboratories
provided
a
team
of
scientists
to
review
the
Navy
's
technical
investigation
.


During
its
review
,
Sandia
determined
that
a
significant
overram
of
the
powder
bags
into
the
gun
had
occurred
as
it
was
being
loaded
and
that
the
overram
could
have
caused
the
explosion
.


A
subsequent
test
by
the
Navy
of
the
overram
scenario
confirmed
that
an
overram
could
have
caused
an
explosion
in
the
gun
breech
.


Sandia
's
technicians
also
found
that
the
physical
evidence
did
not
support
the
U.S.
Navy
's
theory
that
an
electronic
or
chemical
detonator
had
been
used
to
initiate
the
explosion
.


In
response
to
the
new
findings
,
the
U.S.
Navy
,
with
Sandia
's
assistance
,
reopened
the
investigation
.


In
August
1991
,
Sandia
and
the
GAO
completed
their
reports
,
concluding
that
the
explosion
was
likely
caused
by
an
accidental
overram
of
powder
bags
into
the
breech
of
the
16-inch
gun
.


The
U.S.
Navy
,
however
,
disagreed
with
Sandia
's
opinion
and
concluded
that
the
cause
of
the
explosion
could
not
be
determined
.


The
U.S.
Navy
expressed
regret
(
but
did
not
offer
apology
)
to
Hartwig
's
family
and
closed
its
investigation
.


The
USS
``
Constellation
''
vs
``
La
Vengeance
''
,
or
the
Action
of
1
February
1800
,
was
a
single-ship
action
fought
between
frigates
of
the
French
Navy
and
the
United
States
Navy
during
the
Quasi-War
.


In
the
battle
the
American
frigate
USS
``
Constellation
''
tried
to
take
the
French
frigate
``
La
Vengeance
''
as
a
prize
.


Both
ships
were
heavily
damaged
.


although
the
french
frigate
struck
her
colors
twice
,
she
managed
to
flee
only
after
the
main
mast
of
her
opponent
had
fallen
.


In
1798
,
an
undeclared
war
had
begun
between
the
United
States
and
France
due
to
French
seizures
of
American
merchantmen
.


As
part
of
an
American
effort
to
deter
French
attacks
,
Commodore
Thomas
Truxton
led
an
American
naval
squadron
that
was
dispatched
to
the
Lesser
Antilles
.


Learning
that
regular
French
naval
forces
were
in
the
region
,
Truxton
set
out
in
his
flagship
``
Constellation
''
and
sailed
to
Guadeloupe
to
engage
them
.


On
1
February
1800
,
while
nearing
the
French
colony
,
``
Constellation
''
met
François
Marie
Pitot
's
frigate
``
La
Vengeance
''
of
the
French
Navy
.


Despite
Pitot
's
attempts
to
flee
,
his
frigate
was
drawn
into
a
heavy
engagement
with
``
Constellation
''
.


although
the
french
frigate
struck
her
colors
(
surrendered
)
twice
,
``
constellation
''
was
unable
to
take
``
la
vengeance
''
as
a
prize
.


Eventually
Pitot
was
able
to
escape
with
his
frigate
to
Curaçao
,
though
only
after
sustaining
severe
casualties
and
damage
to
his
vessel
.


Truxton
's
ship
sustained
serious
damage
and
sailed
to
Jamaica
for
repairs
before
returning
home
to
a
hero
's
welcome
.

The
War
of
the
Spanish
Succession
(
1701–1714
)
was
a
European
conflict
of
the
early
18th
century
between
dynastic
claimants
and
their
respective
allies
for
the
throne
of
Spain
:
the
Habsburg
Dynasty
,
based
in
Austria
,
and
the
Bourbon
Dynasty
,
originating
in
France
.


The
thirteen-year
war
was
triggered
by
the
death
of
the
childless
Charles
II
of
Spain
in
November
1700
,
and
eventually
evolved
into
a
global
conflict
due
to
overseas
colonies
and
allies
.


The
closest
heirs
to
the
throne
were
members
of
the
Austrian
Habsburg
and
French
Bourbon
families
;
acquisition
of
an
undivided
Spanish
Empire
by
either
of
these
dynasties
would
have
threatened
the
European
balance
of
power
.


Charles
bequeathed
an
undivided
Monarchy
of
Spain
to
Louis
XIV
's
grandson
Philip
,
who
was
proclaimed
King
of
Spain
on
16
November
1700
.


Disputes
over
separation
of
the
Spanish
and
French
crowns
and
commercial
rights
led
to
war
in
1701
between
the
Bourbons
of
France
and
Spain
and
the
Grand
Alliance
,
whose
candidate
was
Archduke
Charles
,
younger
son
of
Leopold
I
,
Holy
Roman
Emperor
.


By
the
end
of
1706
Allied
victories
in
Italy
and
the
Low
Countries
forced
the
French
back
within
their
borders
but
the
Allies
were
unable
to
make
a
decisive
breakthrough
.


Control
of
the
sea
allowed
the
Allies
to
conduct
successful
offensives
in
Spain
,
but
lack
of
popular
support
for
Archduke
Charles
meant
they
could
not
hold
territory
outside
the
coastal
areas
.


Conflict
extended
to
European
colonies
in
North
America
(
where
it
is
known
as
Queen
Anne
's
War
)
and
in
the
West
Indies
,
as
well
as
to
minor
struggles
in
Colonial
India
.


Related
conflicts
include
Rákóczi
's
War
of
Independence
in
Hungary
,
funded
by
France
,
and
the
1704–1710
Camisard
rebellion
in
South-East
France
,
funded
by
Britain
.


When
the
Emperor
Joseph
I
died
in
1711
,
the
Archduke
(
his
younger
half-brother
)
succeeded
him
as
Charles
VI
,
undermining
a
primary
driver
behind
the
war
,
which
was
to
prevent
Spain
being
united
with
either
France
or
Austria
.


The
1710
British
election
returned
a
new
government
committed
to
ending
conflict
,
and
with
the
Allied
war-effort
now
dependent
on
British
financing
,
this
eventually
forced
the
other
Allies
to
make
peace
.


the
war
ended
with
the
1713
treaty
of
utrecht
,
followed
in
1714
by
the
treaties
of
rastatt
and
baden
.


In
return
for
recognition
as
King
of
Spain
,
Philip
V
renounced
his
place
in
the
line
of
succession
to
the
French
throne
,
both
for
himself
and
his
descendants
;
Spain
retained
the
bulk
of
its
possessions
outside
Europe
,
while
its
territories
in
Italy
and
the
Netherlands
were
divided
between
Austria
,
Britain
and
Savoy
.


The
Dutch
Republic
regained
its
Barrier
Fortresses
,
while
France
acknowledged
the
Protestant
succession
in
Britain
and
agreed
to
end
support
for
the
Jacobite
exiles
.


In
the
longer
term
,
the
commercial
provisions
of
Utrecht
confirmed
Britain
's
status
as
the
leading
European
maritime
and
commercial
power
,
while
the
Dutch
lost
their
position
as
the
pre-eminent
economic
power
in
Asia
-
the
war
marked
the
decline
of
the
United
Provinces
as
a
first-rank
power
.


Other
long-term
results
included
the
development
of
a
centralised
Spanish
state
and
the
acceleration
of
the
re-organisation
of
the
Holy
Roman
Empire
into
larger
and
more
powerful
German
principalities
.


Hurricane
Carol
was
among
the
worst
tropical
cyclones
on
record
to
affect
the
states
of
Connecticut
and
Rhode
Island
in
the
United
States
.


It
developed
from
a
tropical
wave
near
the
Bahamas
on
August
25
,
1954
,
and
slowly
strengthened
as
it
moved
northwestward
.


On
August
27
,
Carol
intensified
to
reach
winds
of
105
mph
(
165
km/h
)
,
but
weakened
as
its
motion
turned
to
a
northwest
drift
.


A
strong
trough
of
low
pressure
turned
the
hurricane
northeastward
,
and
Carol
later
intensified
into
a
major
hurricane
.


While
paralleling
the
Mid-Atlantic
and
Southeastern
United
States
,
the
storm
produced
strong
winds
and
rough
seas
that
caused
minor
coastal
flooding
and
slight
damage
to
houses
in
North
Carolina
,
Virginia
,
Washington
,
D.C.
,
Delaware
,
and
New
Jersey
.


The
well-organized
hurricane
accelerated
north-northeastward
and
made
landfall
on
eastern
Long
Island
,
New
York
,
and
then
over
eastern
Connecticut
on
August
31
with
sustained
winds
estimated
at
110-mph
and
a
barometric
pressure
near
956
mb
.


Carol
later
transitioned
into
an
extratropical
cyclone
over
New
Hampshire
,
on
August
31
,
1954
.


In
New
York
,
strong
winds
on
Long
Island
damaged
about
1,000
houses
,
left
275,000
people
without
electricity
,
downed
many
trees
,
and
resulted
in
heavy
crop
losses
.


storm
surge
flooded
laguardia
airport
and
inundated
the
montauk
highway
,
which
left
the
eastern
portion
of
long
island
isolated
.


Carol
also
brought
strong
winds
and
rough
seas
to
coastal
Connecticut
,
Rhode
Island
,
and
southeastern
Massachusetts
.


Throughout
the
region
,
about
150,000
people
were
left
without
electricity
and
telephone
service
.


1,545
houses
were
destroyed
and
another
9,720
were
damaged
.


Approximately
3,500
cars
and
3,000
boats
were
destroyed
.


There
were
65
deaths
and
1,000
injuries
in
New
England
.


The
storm
caused
an
additional
$
1
million
in
damage
in
Canada
as
well
as
two
deaths
.


Overall
,
Carol
caused
72
fatalities
and
damage
totaled
$
462
million
(
1954
USD
)
,
making
it
the
costliest
hurricane
in
the
history
of
the
United
States
,
at
the
time
.


Following
the
storm
,
Carol
was
retired
,
becoming
the
first
name
to
be
removed
from
the
naming
lists
in
the
Atlantic
basin
.


the
perth
agreement
is
an
agreement
made
by
the
prime
ministers
of
the
sixteen
countries
of
the
commonwealth
of
nations
which
retain
the
westminster
monarchical
form
of
government
(
these
sixteen
being
the
commonwealth
realms
)
.


the
perth
agreement
concerns
amendments
to
the
royal
succession
(
and
ancillary
matters
thereto
)
to
the
british
throne
,
whose
institutions
and
legal
framework
are
(
largely
)
shared
equally
between
britain
and
the
other
commonwealth
realms
.


The
changes
,
in
summary
,
comprised
replacing
male-preference
primogeniture
―
under
which
male
descendants
take
precedence
over
females
in
the
line
of
succession
―
with
absolute
primogeniture
(
which
does
not
distinguish
gender
as
a
succession
criterion
)
;
ending
the
disqualification
of
those
who
had
married
Roman
Catholics
;
and
limiting
the
number
of
individuals
in
line
to
the
throne
requiring
permission
from
the
Sovereign
to
marry
.


However
,
the
ban
on
Catholics
and
other
non-Protestants
becoming
Monarch
and
the
requirement
for
the
Sovereign
to
be
in
communion
with
the
Church
of
England
remained
.


the
agreement
was
signed
in
october
2011
in
perth
in
the
commonwealth
of
australia
(
itself
the
third
most
populous
commonwealth
realm
,
after
britain
and
canada
)
,
which
played
host
to
the
biennial
commonwealth
heads
of
government
meeting
(
``
chogm
''
)
.


though
taking
place
during
the
chogm
summit
,
the
perth
agreement
represents
a
side
accord
in
commonwealth
affairs
,
since
most
commonwealth
member-states
do
not
have
a
monarchical
form
of
government
-
notwithstanding
that
queen
elizabeth
ii
is
the
head
of
the
commonwealth
.


By
December
2012
,
all
the
realm
governments
had
agreed
to
implement
the
proposals
.


New
Zealand
chaired
a
working
group
to
determine
the
process
for
reform
.


The
Commonwealth
realms—the
United
Kingdom
,
Canada
,
Australia
,
New

,
Jamaica
,
Barbados
,
the
Bahamas
,
Grenada
,
Papua

,
and
Saint
Kitts
and
Nevis—are
independent
of
each
other
,
while
sharing
one
person
as
monarch
in
a
constitutionally
equal
fashion
.


It
was
affirmed
that
legislation
in
those
realms
that
required
it
would
commence
when
the
appropriate
domestic
arrangements
were
in
place
in
all
the
realms
and
the
Deputy
Prime
Minister
of
the
United
Kingdom
announced
on
26
March
2015
that
the
amendments
had
come
into
effect
``
across
''
every
realm
;
Canada
's
law
was
challenged
in
court
but
has
been
upheld
.


On
the
day
the
changes
came
into
effect
in
March
2015
,
the
first
of
the
persons
then
in
line
of
succession
to
be
affected
were
the
children
of
Lady
Davina
Lewis—her
son
Tāne
(
born
2012
)
and
her
daughter
Senna
(
born

)
—whose
positions
were
reversed

The
Capture
of
Le
Quesnoy
was
an
engagement
of
the
First
World
War
that
took
place
on
4
November
1918
as
part
of
the
Battle
of
the
Sambre
.


Elements
of
the
New
Zealand
Division
scaled
the
fortified
walls
of
the
French
town
of
Le
Quesnoy
and
captured
it
from
elements
of
the
defending
German
22nd
Division
.


Beginning
at
5:30
am
,
the
New
Zealand
Rifle
Brigade
advanced
from
its
starting
positions
east
of
the
town
,
aiming
to
surround
it
and
link
up
on
the
far
side
.


By
late
morning
,
the
linkup
had
been
achieved
and
other
elements
of
the
New
Zealand
Division
moved
further
west
into
the
Mormal
Forest
,
leaving
the
Rifle
Brigade
to
capture
the
town
itself
.


After
mopping
up
outlying
outposts
,
the
New
Zealanders
moved
up
to
the
ramparts
of
the
town
,
but
were
held
back
by
machine-gun
fire
.


Late
in
the
afternoon
,
a
scouting
party
located
an
unguarded
section
of
the
walls
and
the
brigade
's
4th
Battalion
managed
to
climb
the
ramparts
and
move
into
the
town
,
quickly
seizing
it
.


The
capture
of
Le
Quesnoy
was
the
last
major
engagement
of
the
war
for
the
New
Zealanders
.


The
Battle
of
Stavuchany
was
a
battle
between
the
Russian
and
Ottoman
armies
,
which
took
place
on
August
17
(
28
)
of
1739
during
the
Russo-Turkish
War
of
1735-1739
.


Stavuchany
(
)
is
a
small
village
some
12
km
southwest
of
Khotyn
(
today
's
Chernivtsi
Oblast
in
Ukraine
)
.


The
Russian
army
(
approx
.


61,000
men
and
250
cannons
)
under
the
command
of
Field
Marshal
Burkhard
Christoph
von
Münnich
approached
Stavuchany
,
where
the
Ottoman
army
(
80,000
to
90,000
men
)
under
the
leadership
of
serasker
Veli-pasha
occupied
fortified
heights
.


The
Ottoman
commander
attempted
to
surround
the
Russian
troops
,
but
Münnich
was
able
to
repel
numerous
enemy
attacks
from
his
flanks
and
rear
.


The
Russians
managed
to
distract
the
Ottomans
by
their
``
window-dressing
''
activities
on
the
left
flank
and
then
attacked
the
central
positions
of
the
Ottoman
army
with
main
forces
,
and
captured
them
.


The
Russian
army
captured
some
50
cannons
and
other
trophies
.


The
Ottoman
army
lost
up
to
1,000
men
dead
,
while
the
Russians
lost
13
killed
and
54
wounded
.


As
a
result
of
the
Battle
of
Stavuchany
,
the
Ottoman
fortress
of
Khotyn
was
captured
on
August
19
(
30
)
and
the
Russians
occupied
most
of
the
Wallachia
in
September
.


despite
the
victory
,
russia
had
to
agree
to
the
terms
of
the
treaty
of
belgrade
(
september
18
(
29
)
,
1739
)
due
to
austria
's
withdrawal
from
the
war
,
which
practically
reduced
the
achievements
of
the
russian
army
to
zero
.


The
Siege
of
Godesberg
,
18
November
–
17
December
1583
,
was
the
first
major
siege
of
the
Cologne
War
(
1583–1589
)
.


Seeking
to
wrest
control
of
an
important
fortification
,
Bavarian
and
mercenary
soldiers
surrounded
the
Godesberg
,
and
the
village
then
of
the
same
name
,
now
Bad
Godesberg
,
located
at
its
foot
.


On
top
of
the
mountain
sat
a
formidable
fortress
,
similarly
named
Godesburg
,
built
in
the
early
13th
century
during
a
contest
over
the
election
of
two
competing
archbishops
.


Towering
over
the
Rhine
valley
,
the
Godesburg
's
strategic
position
commanded
the
roads
leading
to
and
from
Bonn
,
the
Elector
of
Cologne
's
capital
city
,
and
Cologne
,
the
region
's
economic
powerhouse
.


over
time
,
the
electors
strengthened
its
walls
and
heightened
its
towers
.


They
added
a
small
residence
in
the
14th
century
and
the
``
donjon
''
(
also
called
a
``
Bergfried
''
or
keep
)
developed
as
a
stronghold
of
the
Electoral
archives
and
valuables
.


By
the
mid-16th
century
,
the
Godesburg
was
considered
nearly
impregnable
and
had
become
a
symbol
of
the
dual
power
of
the
Prince-electors
and
Archbishops
of
Cologne
,
one
of
the
wealthiest
ecclesiastical
territories
in
the
Holy
Roman
Empire
.


The
Cologne
War
,
a
feud
between
the
Protestant
Elector
,
Gebhard
,
Truchsess
of
Waldburg
,
and
the
Catholic
Elector
,
Ernst
of
Bavaria
,
was
yet
another
schismatic
episode
in
the
Electoral
and
archdiocesan
history
.


The
Godesburg
came
under
attack
from
Bavarian
forces
in
November
1583
.


It
resisted
a
lengthy
cannonade
by
the
attacking
army
;
finally
,
sappers
tunneled
into
the
basalt
core
of
the
mountain
,
placed
of
powder
into
the
tunnel
and
blew
up
a
significant
part
of
the
fortifications
.


The
explosion
killed
many
of
the
defending
troops
,
but
the
resulting
rubble
impeded
the
attackers
'
progress
,
and
the
remaining
defenders
continued
to
offer
staunch
resistance
.


Only
when
some
of
the
attackers
entered
the
castle
's
inner
courtyard
through
the
latrine
system
were
the
Bavarians
able
to
overcome
their
opponents
.


The
Godesburg
's
commander
and
some
surviving
defenders
took
refuge
in
the
keep
;
using
prisoners
held
in
the
dungeons
as
hostages
,
the
commander
negotiated
safe
passage
for
himself
,
his
wife
and
his
lieutenant
.


The
others
who
were
left
in
the
keep—men
,
women
and
children—were
killed
.


Nearby
Bonn
fell
to
the
Bavarians
the
following
month
.


The
Sino-Burmese
War
(
;
)
,
also
known
as
the
Qing
invasions
of
Burma
or
the
Myanmar
campaign
of
the
Qing
dynasty
,
was
a
war
fought
between
the
Qing
dynasty
of
China
and
the
Konbaung
dynasty
of
Burma
(
Myanmar
)
.


China
under
the
Qianlong
Emperor
launched
four
invasions
of
Burma
between
1765
and
1769
,
which
were
considered
as
one
of
his
Ten
Great
Campaigns
.


Nonetheless
,
the
war
,
which
claimed
the
lives
of
over
70,000
Chinese
soldiers
and
four
commanders
,
is
sometimes
described
as
``
the
most
disastrous
frontier
war
that
the
Qing
dynasty
had
ever
waged
''
,
and
one
that
``
assured
Burmese
independence
''
.


Burma
's
successful
defense
laid
the
foundation
for
the
present-day
boundary
between
the
two
countries
.


At
first
,
the
Emperor
envisaged
an
easy
war
,
and
sent
in
only
the
Green
Standard
troops
stationed
in
Yunnan
.


The
Qing
invasion
came
as
the
majority
of
Burmese
forces
were
deployed
in
their
latest
invasion
of
Siam
.


Nonetheless
,
battle-hardened
Burmese
troops
defeated
the
first
two
invasions
of
1765–1766
and
1766–1767
at
the
border
.


The
regional
conflict
now
escalated
to
a
major
war
that
involved
military
maneuvers
nationwide
in
both
countries
.


The
third
invasion
(
1767–1768
)
led
by
the
elite
Manchu
Bannermen
nearly
succeeded
,
penetrating
deep
into
central
Burma
within
a
few
days
'
march
from
the
capital
,
Ava
(
Inwa
)
.


But
the
bannermen
of
northern
China
could
not
cope
with
unfamiliar
tropical
terrains
and
lethal
endemic
diseases
,
and
were
driven
back
with
heavy
losses
.


After
the
close-call
,
King
Hsinbyushin
redeployed
his
armies
from
Siam
to
the
Chinese
front
.


The
fourth
and
largest
invasion
got
bogged
down
at
the
frontier
.


With
the
Qing
forces
completely
encircled
,
a
truce
was
reached
between
the
field
commanders
of
the
two
sides
in
December
1769
.


The
Qing
kept
a
heavy
military
lineup
in
the
border
areas
of
Yunnan
for
about
one
decade
in
an
attempt
to
wage
another
war
while
imposing
a
ban
on
inter-border
trade
for
two
decades
.


The
Burmese
,
too
,
were
preoccupied
with
the
Chinese
threat
,
and
kept
a
series
of
garrisons
along
the
border
.


Twenty
years
later
,
when
Burma
and
China
resumed
a
diplomatic
relationship
in
1790
,
the
Qing
unilaterally
viewed
the
act
as
Burmese
submission
,
and
claimed
victory
.


Ultimately
the
main
beneficiaries
of
this
war
were
the
Siamese
,
who
reclaimed
most
of
their
territories
in
the
next
three
years
after
having
lost
their
capital
Ayutthaya
to
the
Burmese
in
1767
.


The
Battle
of
Rostov
(
1941
)
was
a
battle
of
the
Eastern
Front
of
World
War
II
,
fought
around
Rostov-on-Don
between
the
Army
Group
South
of
Nazi
Germany
and
the
Southern
Front
of
the
Soviet
Union
.


The
battle
comprised
three
phases
:
the
German
Sea
of
Azov
Offensive
Operation
by
Army
Group
South
(
General
Gerd
von
Rundstedt
)
(
begun
on
12
September
1941
)
,
the
Soviet
Rostov
Defensive
Operation
(
5
November
1941
–
16
November
1941
)
by
the
Southern
Front
(
General
Yakov
Timofeyevich
Cherevichenko
)
,
and
the
Rostov
Offensive
Operation
(
27
November
1941
–
2
December
1941
)
executed
by
the
same
Soviet
Front
.


After
forcing
their
way
across
the
Mius
river
on
17
November
,
the
German
forces
captured
10,000
Soviet
troops
and
took
Rostov
on
21
November
.


Six
days
later
the
Southern
Front
,
reinforced
with
the
newly
raised
37th
Army
,
counterattacked
from
the
north
and
threatened
to
surround
the
overstretched
German
III
Motorized
Army
Corps
.


Rundstedt
then
ordered
a
retreat
to
the
Mius
line
from
Rostov
to
prevent
the
encirclement
,
which
prompted
Hitler
to
immediately
fire
him
.


rundstedt
's
successor
walther
von
reichenau
confirmed
the
retreat
order
with
the
backing
of
the
army
high
command
chief
of
staff
franz
halder
and
hitler
relented
.


The
Red
Army
retook
Rostov
on
28
November
.


It
was
the
first
successful
major
Soviet
counteroffensive
of
the
war
.


The
Hue–Da
Nang
Campaign
was
a
series
of
military
actions
conducted
by
the
People
's
Army
of
Vietnam
(
PAVN
)
against
the
Army
of
the
Republic
of
Vietnam
(
ARVN
)
during
the
Vietnam
War
,
also
known
in
Vietnam
as
the
American
War
.


The
campaign
was
centred
on
the
cities
of
Huế
(
Thừa
Thiên-Huế
Province
)
and
Da
Nang
(
Quảng
Nam
Province
)
,
with
secondary
fronts
in
the
provinces
of
Quảng
Trị
and
Quảng
Ngãi
.


The
campaign
began
on
March
5
and
concluded
on
April
2
,
1975
.


During
the
spring
season
of
1975
,
the
PAVN
High
Command
in
Hanoi
made
the
decision
to
seize
the
major
South
Vietnamese
cities
of
Huế
and
Da
Nang
,
and
also
destroy
the
various
South
Vietnamese
units
in
I
Corps
Tactical
Zone
,
led
by
ARVN
General
Ngô
Quang
Trưởng
.


Originally
,
the
campaign
was
planned
to
take
place
over
two
phases
;
during
the
seasons
of
spring-summer
and
autumn
.


However
,
as
the
North
Vietnamese
forces
rolled
over
South
Vietnamese
defences
on
the
outskirts
of
Huế
and
Da
Nang
,
President
Nguyễn
Văn
Thiệu
ordered
General
Trưởng
to
abandon
all
territories
under
his
control
,
and
pull
his
forces
back
to
the
coastal
areas
of
I
Corps
.


The
South
Vietnamese
withdrawal
quickly
turned
into
a
rout
,
as
the
PAVN
2nd
Army
Corps
picked
off
one
South
Vietnamese
unit
after
another
,
until
Huế
and
Da
Nang
were
completely
surrounded
.


By
March
29
,
1975
,
PAVN
troops
had
full
control
of
Huế
and
Da
Nang
,
while
South
Vietnam
lost
all
territories
and
most
of
the
units
belonging
to
I
Corps
.


The
fall
of
Huế
and
Da
Nang
did
not
spell
the
end
of
the
misery
suffered
by
the
ARVN
.


On
March
31
,
ARVN
General
Phạm
Văn
Phú—commander
of
II
Corps
Tactical
Zone—attempted
to
form
a
new
defensive
line
from
Qui
Nhơn
to
cover
the
retreat
of
the
ARVN
22nd
Infantry
Division
,
but
they
too
were
destroyed
by
the
PAVN
.


By
April
2
,
South
Vietnam
had
lost
control
of
the
northern
provinces
,
as
well
as
two
army
corps
.


The
Battle
of
the
300
Champions
,
known
since
Herodotus
'
day
as
the
Battle
of
the
Champions
,
was
a
battle
fought
in
roughly
546
BC
between
Argos
and
Sparta
.


Rather
than
commit
full
armies
both
sides
agreed
to
pitting
300
of
their
best
men
against
each
other
.


According
to
Herodotus
Sparta
had
surrounded
and
captured
the
plain
of
Thyrea
.


When
the
Argives
marched
out
to
defend
it
,
the
two
armies
agreed
to
let
300
champions
from
each
city
fight
,
with
the
winner
taking
the
territory
.


Presumably
the
idea
was
to
reduce
the
total
number
of
casualties
.


Both
armies
marched
home
,
so
as
to
prevent
either
side
from
helping
their
champions
and
escalating
the
duel
into
a
full
battle
.


Neither
side
would
allow
for
any
injured
men
to
be
taken
.


The
day
called
for
complete
destruction
of
the
enemy
force
for
victory
.


The
two
armies
were
evenly
matched
and
neither
could
gain
the
upper
hand
.


They
fought
until
nightfall
,
and
after
a
bloody
battle
only
three
men
remained
,
two
Argives
and
one
Spartan
.


The
Argives
,
Alcenor
and
Chromius
,
believing
that
they
had
killed
all
of
the
Spartans
,
left
the
battlefield
racing
home
to
Argos
to
announce
their
victory
.


However
,
they
had
made
one
mistake
:
Othryades
,
an
injured
Spartan
,
had
survived
.


As
he
was
technically
the
last
man
standing
on
the
battlefield
from
either
army
,
he
too
claimed
victory
.


He
survived
long
enough
to
tell
his
baggage
handlers
of
this
,
and
then
he
committed
suicide
.


By
tradition
,
Othryades
was
ashamed
to
be
the
only
man
in
his
unit
to
live
,
and
so
he
killed
himself
on
the
field
of
battle
rather
than
return
to
Sparta
.


The
reason
for
the
suicide
is
up
for
debate
,
but
the
act
is
of
great
importance
.


Othryades
did
not
die
by
an
Argive
sword
,
and
the
Spartans
could
always
claim
that
he
survived
the
battle
and
killed
himself
in
shame
,
thus
gaining
an
upper
hand
due
to
this
act
of
honor
.


Both
sides
were
able
to
claim
victory
:
the
Argives
because
more
of
their
champions
had
survived
,
and
the
Spartans
because
their
single
champion
held
the
field
.


Argos
did
not
take
too
kindly
to
the
Spartans
claiming
victory
and
sent
their
entire
hoplite
army
which
was
met
by
a
Spartan
force
of
equal
magnitude
.


The
Spartans
won
a
decisive
victory
and
as
a
result
gained
control
of
Thyreatis
.


Pausanias
adds
that
the
battle
was
foretold
by
the
Sibyl
,
and
that
the
Argives
considered
themselves
the
victors
and
dedicated
a
bronze
sculpture
of
the
Trojan
horse
at
Delphi
to
commemorate
the
victory
.


However
,
Pausanias
says
that
the
sculptor
of
this
horse
was
Antiphanes
of
Argos
,
who
dates
to
ca
.


400
BC
.


Therefore
,
either
Pausanias
is
mistaken
,
or
he
is
confusing
this
with
a
battle
at
Thyrea
in
424
BC
.


Years
later
,
in
420
BC
during
a
lull
in
the
Peloponnesian
War
,
Argos
challenged
Sparta
to
a
rematch
of
the
Battle
of
the
300
Champions
.


Sparta
declined
.


The
Battle
of
Les
Avins
or
Battle
of
Avein
was
fought
on
20
May
1635
during
the
Thirty
Years
'
War
between
a
French
and
a
Spanish
army
.


The
battle
was
fought
in
the
Belgian
village
of
Les
Avins
,
south
of
Huy
,
in
what
was
then
the
bishopric
of
Liège
.


It
was
the
first
serious
engagement
for
the
French
,
who
had
entered
the
war
only
three
months
before
.


The
French
army
was
under
command
of
Marshals
of
France
Urbain
de
Maillé-Brézé
and
Gaspard
III
de
Coligny
,
Maréchal
de
Châtillon
.


The
Spanish
were
commanded
by
Thomas
Francis
,
Prince
of
Carignano
.


The
Spanish
army
,
inferior
in
numbers
,
was
surrounded
and
completely
defeated
in
just
a
few
hours
.


Some
4,000
Spanish
were
killed
,
wounded
and
captured
.


Hurricane
Hernan
was
fourth
and
final
tropical
cyclone
to
strike
Mexico
at
hurricane
intensity
during
the
1996
Pacific
hurricane
season
.


The
thirteenth
tropical
cyclone
,
eighth
named
storm
,
and
fifth
hurricane
of
the
season
,
Hernan
developed
as
a
tropical
depression
from
a
tropical
wave
to
the
south
of
Mexico
on
September
30
.


the
depression
quickly
strengthened
,
and
became
tropical
storm
hernan
later
that
day
.


Hernan
curved
north-northwestward
the
following
day
,
before
eventually
turning
north-northeastward
.


Still
offshore
of
the
Mexican
coast
on
October
2
,
Hernan
intensified
into
a
hurricane
.


Six
hours
later
,
Hernan
attained
its
peak
as
an
85
mph
(
140
km/h
)
Category
1
hurricane
on
the
Saffir-Simpson
Hurricane
Wind
Scale
(
SSHWS
)
.


After
weakening
somewhat
,
on
1000
UTC
October
3
,
Hurricane
Hernan
made
landfall
near
Barra
de
Navidad
,
Jalisco
,
with
winds
of
75
mph
(
120
km/h
)
.


Only
two
hours
after
landfall
,
Hernan
weakened
to
a
tropical
storm
.


by
october
4
,
tropical
storm
hernan
had
weakened
into
a
tropical
depression
,
and
dissipated
over
nayarit
on
the
following
day
.


The
storm
dropped
heavy
rainfall
along
the
west
coast
of
Mexico
,
with
some
areas
experiencing
over
of
precipitation
.


As
a
result
of
the
large
amounts
of
rain
,
Hurricane
Hernan
caused
moderate
flooding
.


Despite
impacting
a
relatively
sparsely
populated
area
of
Mexico
,
no
deaths
were
reported
in
the
country
,
though
one
was
reported
missing
.


In
all
,
flooding
from
the
storm
washed-out
highways
,
disrupted
telephone
service
,
caused
power
outages
,
and
damaged
at
least
1,000
homes
.


However
,
at
least
100
injuries
were
recorded
.


In
addition
,
the
remnants
caused
flooding
in
southern
Texas
,
and
one
person
was
presumed
to
have
drowned
.


The
Sventiany
Offensive
(
now
Švenčionys
)
was
a
military
operation
mostly
undertaken
by
the
10th
German
Army
against
the
Russian
10th
Army
as
part
of
the
Eastern
Front
during
World
War
I
.


On
9
September
1915
four
German
cavalry
divisions
,
reinforced
from
13
September
by
two
others
,
filled
the
gap
in
the
Russian
front
and
deployed
an
attack
to
gain
the
rear
of
10th
Russian
army
.


On
9
September
the
Germans
broke
the
Russian
defence
and
six
cavalry
divisions
were
thrown
into
breach
.


Later
the
German
onslaught
,
devoid
of
infantry
and
artillery
support
,
weakened
and
on
15–16
September
was
finally
stopped
by
the
newly
formed
2nd
Russian
army
.


On
October
2
the
Sventiany
breach
was
eliminated
.


Russia
was
victorious
and
Germany
was
pushed
out
.


Hurricane
Charley
was
the
first
of
four
individual
hurricanes
to
impact
or
strike
Florida
during
2004
,
along
with
Frances
,
Ivan
and
Jeanne
,
as
well
as
one
of
the
strongest
hurricanes
ever
to
strike
the
United
States
.


It
was
the
third
named
storm
,
the
second
hurricane
,
and
the
second
major
hurricane
of
the
2004
Atlantic
hurricane
season
.


Charley
lasted
from
August
9
to
15
,
and
at
its
peak
intensity
it
attained
winds
,
making
it
a
strong
Category
4
hurricane
on
the
Saffir-Simpson
Hurricane
Scale
.


It
made
landfall
in
Southwest
Florida
at
maximum
strength
,
making
it
the
strongest
hurricane
to
hit
the
United
States
since
Hurricane
Andrew
struck
Florida
in
1992
and
the
strongest
hurricane
to
hit
southwest
Florida
since
Hurricane
Donna
in
1960
.


After
moving
slowly
through
the
Caribbean
Sea
,
Charley
crossed
Cuba
on
Friday
,
August
13
as
a
Category
3
hurricane
,
causing
heavy
damage
and
four
deaths
.


that
same
day
,
it
crossed
over
the
dry
tortugas
,
just
22
hours
after
tropical
storm
bonnie
had
struck
northwestern
florida
.


It
was
the
first
time
in
history
that
two
tropical
cyclones
struck
the
same
state
in
a
24-hour
period
.


at
its
peak
intensity
of
,
hurricane
charley
struck
the
northern
tip
of
captiva
island
and
the
southern
tip
of
north
captiva
island
,
before
crossing
over
bokeelia
causing
severe
damage
.


Charley
then
continued
to
produce
severe
damage
as
it
made
landfall
on
the
peninsula
in
Punta
Gorda
.


It
continued
to
the
north-northeast
along
the
Peace
River
corridor
,
devastating
Punta
Gorda
,
Port
Charlotte
,
Cleveland
,
Fort
Ogden
,
Nocatee
,
Arcadia
,
Zolfo
Springs
,
Sebring
,
and
Wauchula
.


Zolfo
Springs
was
isolated
for
nearly
two
days
as
masses
of
large
trees
,
power
poles
,
power
lines
,
transformers
,
and
debris
filled
the
streets
.


Wauchula
sustained
gusts
to
;
buildings
in
the
downtown
areas
caved
onto
Main
Street
.


Ultimately
,
the
storm
passed
through
the
central
and
eastern
parts
of
the
Orlando
metropolitan
area
,
still
carrying
winds
gusting
up
to
.


The
city
of
Winter
Park
,
north
of
Orlando
,
also
sustained
considerable
damage
since
its
many
old
,
large
oak
trees
had
not
experienced
high
winds
.


Falling
trees
tore
down
power
utilities
and
smashed
cars
,
and
their
huge
roots
lifted
underground
water
and
sewer
utilities
.


The
storm
slowed
as
it
exited
the
state
over
Ormond
Beach
just
north
of
Daytona
Beach
.


The
storm
was
ultimately
absorbed
by
a
front
in
the
Atlantic
Ocean
shortly
after
sunrise
on
August
15
,
near
southeastern
Massachusetts
.


Charley
was
initially
expected
to
hit
further
north
in
Tampa
,
and
caught
many
Floridians
off-guard
due
to
a
sudden
change
in
the
storm
's
track
as
it
approached
the
state
.


Along
its
path
,
Charley
caused
10
deaths
and
$
16.9
billion
in
damage
to
insured
residential
property
,
making
it
the
second
costliest
hurricane
in
United
States
history
at
the
time
.


Charley
was
a
compact
,
fast-moving
storm
,
which
limited
the
scope
and
severity
of
the
damage
.


The
Battle
of
Mantinea
was
fought
in
207
BC
between
Sparta
under
the
Tyrant
Machanidas
,
as
part
of
the
Aetolian
League
,
and
the
Achaean
League
whose
forces
were
led
by
Philopoemen
.


Both
sides
were
supplemented
by
mercenaries
.


It
was
the
major
land
battle
in
Greece
of
the
First
Macedonian
War
,
which
had
occurred
due
to
Macedonian
alliance
with
Carthage
in
the
aftermath
of
Hannibal
's
victory
at
the
Battle
of
Cannae
in
the
Second
Punic
War
.


Machanidas
routed
and
chased
from
the
field
the
mercenaries
of
Philopoemen
.


They
pursued
,
however
,
too
eagerly
and
when
Machanidas
led
his
men
back
to
the
battle
the
outnumbered
Spartan
infantry
had
been
defeated
and
the
Achaeans
were
strongly
positioned
behind
a
water
filled
ditch
.


Going
back
on
to
the
attack
Machanidas
was
dismounted
as
he
attempted
to
leap
his
horse
over
the
ditch
and
was
slain
.


The
Achaeans
,
allies
of
Macedonia
,
were
victorious
.


the
2007
united
nations
climate
change
conference
took
place
at
the
bali
international
conference
centre
,
nusa
dua
,
in
bali
,
indonesia
,
between
december
3
and
december
15
,
2007
(
though
originally
planned
to
end
on
14
december
)
.


Representatives
from
over
180
countries
attended
,
together
with
observers
from
intergovernmental
and
nongovernmental
organizations
.


The
conference
encompassed
meetings
of
several
bodies
,
including
the
13th
Conference
of
the
Parties
to
the
United
Nations
Framework
Convention
on
Climate
Change
(
COP
13
)
,
the
3rd
Meeting
of
the
Parties
to
the
Kyoto
Protocol
(
MOP
3
or
CMP
3
)
,
together
with
other
subsidiary
bodies
and
a
meeting
of
ministers
.


Negotiations
on
a
successor
to
the
Kyoto
Protocol
dominated
the
conference
.


A
meeting
of
environment
ministers
and
experts
held
in
June
called
on
the
conference
to
agree
on
a
road-map
,
timetable
and
'concrete
steps
for
the
negotiations
'
with
a
view
to
reaching
an
agreement
by
2009
.


It
has
been
debated
whether
this
global
meeting
on
climate
change
has
achieved
anything
significant
at
all
.


Initial
EU
proposals
called
for
global
emissions
to
peak
in
10
to
15
years
and
decline
``
well
below
half
''
of
the
2000
level
by
2050
for
developing
countries
and
for
developed
countries
to
achieve
emissions
levels
20-40
%
below
1990
levels
by
2020
.


The
United
States
strongly
opposed
these
numbers
,
at
times
backed
by
Japan
,
Canada
,
Australia
and
Russia
.


The
resulting
compromise
mandates
``
deep
cuts
in
global
emissions
''
with
references
to
the
IPCC
's
Fourth
Assessment
Report
.


The
Frank
Slide
was
a
rockslide
that
buried
part
of
the
mining
town
of
Frank
,
Northwest
Territories
,
Canada
,
at
4:10
a.m.
on
April
29
,
1903
.


Around
110
million
tonnes
(
121
million
US
tons
)
of
limestone
rock
slid
down
Turtle
Mountain
.


Witnesses
reported
that
the
rock
had
reached
up
the
opposing
hills
within
100
seconds
,
obliterating
the
eastern
edge
of
Frank
,
the
Canadian
Pacific
Railway
line
and
the
coal
mine
.


It
was
one
of
the
largest
landslides
in
Canadian
history
and
remains
the
deadliest
,
as
between
70
and
90
of
the
town
's
residents
were
killed
,
most
of
whom
remain
buried
in
the
rubble
.


Multiple
factors
led
to
the
slide
:
Turtle
Mountain
's
formation
left
it
in
a
constant
state
of
instability
.


Coal
mining
operations
may
have
weakened
the
mountain
's
internal
structure
,
as
did
a
wet
winter
and
cold
snap
on
the
night
of
the
disaster
.


The
railway
was
repaired
within
three
weeks
and
the
mine
was
quickly
reopened
.


The
section
of
town
closest
to
the
mountain
was
relocated
in
1911
amid
fears
that
another
slide
was
possible
.


The
town
's
population
nearly
doubled
its
pre-slide
population
by
1906
,
but
dwindled
after
the
mine
closed
permanently
in
1917
.


The
community
is
now
part
of
the
Municipality
of
Crowsnest
Pass
in
the
Province
of
Alberta
and
has
a
population
around
200
.


The
site
of
the
disaster
,
which
remains
nearly
unchanged
since
the
slide
,
is
now
a
popular
tourist
destination
.


It
has
been
designated
a
Provincial
Historic
Site
of
Alberta
and
is
home
to
an
interpretive
centre
that
receives
over
100,000
visitors
annually
.


Headstrong
is
the
debut
studio
album
by
American
singer
Ashley
Tisdale
,
released
on
February
6
,
2007
,
by
Warner
Bros.
Records
.


Tisdale
began
working
on
the
project
after
the
first
installment
of
``
High
School
Musical
''
(
2006
)
,
and
after
she
had
achieved
the
feat
of
being
the
first
female
artist
to
debut
with
two
songs
on
the
``
Billboard
''
Hot
100
.


Tisdale
describes
her
work
on
the
album
saying
.


``
I
did
n't
really
know
who
I
was
and
I
was
trying
to
figure
out
who
to
do
.


I
now
am
way
more
comfortable
in
my
own
skin
.
''


The
singer
worked
with
a
variety
of
established
writers
and
producers
on
the
album
,
including
Diane
Warren
,
J.R.
Rotem
,
Ryan
Tedder
,
Evan
``
Kidd
''
Bogart
,
and
Kara
DioGuardi
,
among
others
.


Commenting
that
the
album
garnered
its
title
from
her
personality
,
Tisdale
said
she
wanted
to
use
her
first
album
to
formally
introduce
herself
personally
,
and
as
not
one
of
the
characters
she
portrays
.


``
Headstrong
''
s
music
derives
mainly
from
the
genres
of
dance-pop
and
R
&
B
,
provided
by
electronica
.


Meanwhile
,
it
incorporates
hip
hop
beats
and
some
tracks
infuse
dancehall
and
other
world
music
.


The
album
also
lyrically
explores
themes
in
teen
pop
.


Many
critics
compared
her
first
effort
to
the
first
works
of
fellow
Disney-alums
Britney
Spears
and
Christina
Aguilera
.


Carrying
primarily
an
urban
tone
,
the
``
hip
pop
''
of
Gwen
Stefani
is
also
said
to
be
an
influence
on
the
album
.


``
Headstrong
''
itself
was
given
mixed
reviews
by
critics
,
who
while
complimenting
it
overall
,
called
it
ordinary
and
panned
the
ballads
.


Critics
were
also
ambivalent
towards
Tisdale
's
vocal
performance
.


Whereas
,
the
album
debuted
at
number
five
on
the
``
Billboard
''
200
,
selling
over
64,000
copies
in
its
opening
week
,
it
also
charted
in
numerous
international
markets
.


It
was
later
certified
Gold
by
the
Recording
Industry
Association
of
America
and
Irish
Recorded
Music
Association
.


The
album
's
lead
single
,
``
Be
Good
to
Me
,
''
charted
moderately
in
the
United
States
and
select
European
markets
.


Tisdale
's
breakthrough
hit
,
``
He
Said
She
Said
''
peaked
at
58
in
the
US
,
and
appeared
on
several
international
charts
,
peaking
in
the
top
20
in
Germany
and
Austria
.


The
last
two
singles
were
released
in
certain
countries
in
Europe
exclusively
.


The
third
single
,
``
Not
Like
That
''
charted
in
the
top
half
of
several
European
charts
,
while
the
fourth
and
final
single
``
Suddenly
''
charted
in
Germany
.


Tisdale
supported
the
album
with
promotional
appearances
,
``
''
,
and
her
tour
,
``
Headstrong
Tour
Across
America
''
.


The
album
was
voted
as
the
sixth
best
album
of
2006
by
the
readers
of
``
Billboard
''
.

also
obtained
European

won
the
battle
by
moving
faster
than
the
Russians
and
attacking
them
near
their
camp
.

this
was
a
minor
victory
for

tried
to
show
it
as

lost
the
invasion
due
to
the
Russian
maneuvering
around
the
Aras
River
which
culminated
in
the
Battle
of

The
1929
Grand
National
was
the
88th
renewal
of
the
world-famous
Grand
National
horse
race
that
took
place
at
Aintree
Racecourse
near
Liverpool
,
England
,
on
22
March
1929
.


It
had
the
largest
starting
field
of
any
Aintree
Grand
National
with
66
horses
taking
part
in
the
race
.


The
race
was
won
by
100/1
outsider
Gregalach
,
and
it
was
the
second
successive
year
where
a
horse
with
such
odds
won
.


Fourth-placed
Melleray
's
Belle
started
at
odds
of
200/1
and
was
the
first
horse
with
odds
as
wide
as
this
to
finish
in
the
top
four
places
since
Magpie
,
also
a
200/1
bet
in

W.
H.
Everett

Operation
Una
(
)
was
a
military
offensive
conducted
by
the
Croatian
Army
(
``
Hrvatska
vojska
''
–
HV
)
against
the
Army
of
Republika
Srpska
(
``
Vojska
Republike
Srpske
''
–
VRS
)
in
western
Bosnia
and
Herzegovina
on
18–19
September
1995
,
during
the
Bosnian
War
.


The
operation
entailed
a
crossing
of
the
Una
and
Sava
rivers
to
establish
bridgeheads
at
Novi
Grad
,
Bosanska
Dubica
,
Bosanska
Kostajnica
and
opposite
Jasenovac
to
allow
for
a
subsequent
advance
towards
Prijedor
and
Banja
Luka
.


The
operation
was
planned
in
a
matter
of
hours
following
a
meeting
between
Croatian
President
Franjo
Tuđman
and
U.S.
diplomat
Richard
Holbrooke
,
during
which
Holbrooke
urged
Tuđman
to
seize
Prijedor
and
threaten
to
capture
Banja
Luka
from
the
VRS
,
short
of
actually
seizing
the
city
,
as
he
believed
such
a
development
would
force
Bosnian
Serb
leaders
to
the
negotiating
table
.


Inadequate
planning
and
preparation
,
combined
with
flawed
military
intelligence
on
the
defending
force
and
disregard
for
the
high
water
level
of
the
Una
and
Sava
rivers
,
led
to
a
high
number
of
casualties
and
little
success
.


The
offensive
was
called
off
one
day
after
it
was
launched
and
the
bridgeheads
were
evacuated
.

was
the
only
unsuccessful
operation
by
the
HV
from
a
series
of
offensives
which
had
commenced
in
November
1994

It
was
controversial
in
the
Croatian
media
,
but
was
generally
brushed
aside
as
an
aberration
from
a
series
of
successes

the
1988
bangladesh
cyclone
(
designated
as
tropical
cyclone
unk
by
the
joint
typhoon
warning
center
)
was
one
of
the
worst
tropical
cyclones
in
bangladeshi
history
.


Striking
in
November
1988
,
the
tropical
system
exacerbated
the
catastrophic
damage
from
what
was
then
considered
the
worst
floods
in
Bangladesh
's
history
.


The
tropical
cyclone
originated
from
a
disturbance
that
developed
within
the
Strait
of
Malacca
on
November
21
.


Tracking
slowly
westward
,
the
initial
tropical
depression
reached
tropical
storm
status
in
the
Andaman
Sea
.


On
November
26
,
the
storm
reached
an
intensity
equivalent
to
that
of
a
modern-day
severe
cyclonic
storm
and
subsequently
turned
northward
.


Gradually
intensifying
as
it
had
previously
,
the
tropical
cyclone
reached
peak
intensity
with
winds
of
125
mph
(
200
km/h
)
as
it
was
making
landfall
near
the
Bangladesh–India
border
on
November
29
.


although
the
storm
retained
strong
winds
well
inland
,
it
was
last
monitored
over
central
bangladesh
as
a
moderate
cyclonic
unk
on
november
30
.


The
brunt
of
the
tropical
cyclone
's
damage
was
inflicted
upon
coastal
areas
of
Bangladesh
and
West
Bengal
.


A
total
of
6,240
people
were
killed
as
a
result
of
the
storm
,
with
5,708
in
Bangladesh
and
538
in
West
Bengal
.


Many
of
the
deaths
were
a
result
of
the
destruction
of
homes
or
electrocution
after
strong
winds
toppled
power
poles
across
the
region
.


Along
the
coast
of
Bangladesh
,
strong
storm
surge
caused
heavy
infrastructure
damage
and
contributed
in
wiping
out
an
estimated
70
%
of
all
harvestable
Bangladeshi
crops
,
with
an
estimated
200,000
tonnes
(
220,000
tons
)
of
crops
being
lost
.


Widespread
power
outages
cut
telecommunications
across
Bangladesh
;
in
Dhaka
,
Bangladesh

Hurricane
Gloria
was
the
first
significant
tropical
cyclone
to
strike
the
northeastern
United
States
since
Hurricane
Agnes
in
1972
and
the
first
major
storm
to
affect
New
York
and
Long
Island
directly
since
Hurricane
Donna
in
1960
.


it
was
a
powerful
cape
verde
hurricane
that
formed
during
the
1985
atlantic
hurricane
season
,
originating
from
a
tropical
wave
on
september
16
in
the
eastern
atlantic
ocean
.


After
remaining
a
weak
tropical
cyclone
for
several
days
,
Gloria
intensified
into
a
hurricane
on
September
22
north
of
the
Lesser
Antilles
.


During
that
time
,
the
storm
had
moved
generally
westward
,
although
it
turned
to
the
northwest
due
to
a
weakening
of
the
ridge
.


Gloria
quickly
intensified
on
September
24
,
and
the
next
day
reached
peak
winds
of
145
mph
(
230
km/h
)
.


The
hurricane
weakened
before
striking
the
Outer
Banks
of
North
Carolina
on
September
27
.


Later
that
day
,
Gloria
made
two
subsequent
landfalls
on
Long
Island
and
later
western
Connecticut
,
before
becoming
extratropical
on
September
28
over
New
England
.


The
remnants
moved
through
Atlantic
Canada
,
eventually
dissipating
on
October
2
.


Before
Gloria
made
landfall
,
the
National
Hurricane
Center
issued
hurricane
warnings
at
some
point
for
the
East
Coast
of
the
United
States
from
South
Carolina
to
Maine
.


Hundreds
of
thousands
of
people
evacuated
,
and
the
hurricane
was
described
as
the
``
storm
of
the
century
''
.


In
general
,
Gloria
's
strongest
winds
remained
east
of
the
center
,
which
largely
spared
locations
from
North
Carolina
to
New
Jersey
,
and
the
passage
at
low
tide
reduced
storm
surge
.


Hurricane-force
winds
and
gusts
affected
much
of
the
path
,
which
knocked
down
trees
and
power
lines
.


This
left
over
4
million
people
without
power
,
including
the
worst
power
outage
in
Connecticut
history
related
to
a
natural
disaster
.


The
extended
power
outage
on
Long
Island
,
affecting
1.5
million
people
at
some
point
,
caused
the
Long
Island
Lighting
Company
to
be
shut
down
and
be
replaced
with
a
public
company
.


Fallen
trees
caused
six
of
the
storm
's
fourteen
deaths
.


In
North
Carolina
,
high
waves
damaged
many
homes
along
the
Outer
Banks
and
caused
heavy
beach
erosion
.


High
waves
also
damaged
piers
,
boats
,
and
docks
throughout
the
Mid-Atlantic
states
.


Flooding
forced
several
highways
to
close
,
and
in
Pennsylvania
,
thousands
were
forced
to
evacuate
their
homes
.


The
storm
surge
destroyed
48
homes
on
Long
Island
,
while
the
winds
damaged
the
roofs
of
many
more
.


Widespread
crop
damage
occurred
,
amounting
to
about
$
20
million
(
1985
USD
)
.


Overall
damage
in
the
United
States
was
estimated
at
$
900
million
,
which
was
less
than
expected
.


In
neighboring
Canada
,
the
remnants
of
Gloria
caused
minor
power
outages
in
New
Brunswick
,
although
confusion
related
to
the
storm
's
arrival
led
to
the
creation
of
the
Canadian
Hurricane
Centre
.

''
,
showed

''
the
cameraman
says

According
to
a
Facebook
page
of
Islamist
activists
from
the
area
,
members
of
the
Free
Syrian
Army
and
the
Islamic
extremist
Al-Nusra
Front
rebel
groups
were
involved
.


According
to
opposition
activists
,
most
of
the
dead
were
pro-government
fighters
but
civilians
were
killed
as
well
,
including
women
and
children
.


Three
Shia
clerics
were
also
among
the
dead
.


Reports
said
that
30
civilians
were
killed
.


Syrian
opposition
forces
also
burned
civilian
houses
and
a
Shia
mosque
during
the
takeover
.


10
rebel
fighters
were
killed
during
the
attack
.


150
Shia
residents
fled
to
the
nearby
government-held
village
of

A
major
earthquake
occurred
in
Nepal
on
12
May
2015
at
12:50
pm
local
time
(
07:05
UTC
)
with
a
moment
magnitude
of
7.3
,
18
km
(
11

)
southeast
of
Kodari
.


The
epicenter
was
on
the
border
of
Dolakha
and
Sindhupalchowk
,
two
districts
of
Nepal
.


This
earthquake
occurred
on
the
same
fault
as
the
larger
magnitude
7.8
earthquake
of
25
April
,
but
further
east
than
the
original
quake
.


As
such
,
it
is
considered
to
be
an
aftershock
of
25
April
quake
.


It
struck
at
a
depth
of
.


Shaking
was
felt
in
northern
parts
of
India
including
Bihar
,
Uttar
Pradesh
and
West
Bengal
.


Tremors
were
felt
as
far
as
about
2,400
kilometers
away
from
the
epicenter
in
Chennai
.


Minutes
later
,
another
6.3
magnitude
earthquake
hit
Nepal
with
its
epicenter
in
Ramechhap
,
east
of
Kathmandu
.


The
earthquake
was
felt
in
Bangladesh
,
China
and
many
other
states
in
India
.


The
impact
of
these
tremors
was
felt
even
1,000
kilometres
away
in

,
where
buildings

annual
hurricane
season
,
Earl
developed
on
August
13
from
a
tropical
wave
centered
well
east
of
the
Lesser
Antilles
.


the
depression
gradually
organized
as
it
tracked
west-northwestward
and
was
upgraded
to
tropical
storm
earl
roughly
a
day
after
genesis
.


As
the
system
approached
the
Windward
Islands
it
continued
to
slowly
strengthen
,
peaking
as
a
50
mph
(
85
km/h
)
tropical
storm
early
on
August
15
.


However
,
the
system
unexpectedly
degenerated
into
a
tropical
wave
that
afternoon
,
likely
due
to
its
fast
forward
motion
.


The
remnants
of
Earl
continued
across
the
Caribbean
Sea
and
eventually
re-developed
into
Hurricane
Frank
in
the
eastern
Pacific
Ocean
on
August
23
.


Gusty
winds
in
Grenada
damaged
at
least
34
roofs
and
knocked
down
twelve
trees
and
six
electrical
poles
.


Additionally
,
a
nursing
home
on
the
island
was
evacuated
due
to
significant
structural
damage
.


Two
houses
lost
their
roofs
in
Saint

and
the
Grenadines
,
while
moderate
crop
damage
was
reported
on
the
island
.


Downed
trees
and
power
lines
in
Tobago
left
90
%
of
the
island
without

The
Wall
Street
bombing
occurred
at
12:01
pm
on
Thursday
,
September
16
,
1920
,
in
the
Financial
District
of
Manhattan
,
New

City
.


The
blast
killed
30
people
immediately
,
and
another
eight
died
later
of
wounds
sustained
in
the
blast
.


There
were
143
seriously
injured
,
and
the
total
number
of
injured
was
in
the
hundreds
.


The
bombing
was
never
solved
,
although
investigators
and
historians
believe
the
Wall
Street
bombing
was
carried
out
by
Galleanists
(
Italian
anarchists
)
,
a
group
responsible
for
a
series
of
bombings
the
previous
year
.


The
attack
was
related
to
postwar
social
unrest
,
labor
struggles
,
and
anti-capitalist
agitation
in
the
United
States
.


The
Wall
Street
bomb
killed
more
people
than
the
1910
bombing
of
the
``
Los
Angeles
Times
''
,
which
was
the
deadliest
act
of
terrorism
on
U.S.
soil

the
kokoda
track
campaign
or
kokoda
trail
campaign
was
part
of
the
pacific
war
of

.


The
campaign
consisted
of
a
series
of
battles
fought
between
July
and
November
1942
in
what
was
then
the
Australian
Territory
of
Papua
.


it
was
primarily
a
land
battle
,
between
the
japanese
south
seas
detachment
under
major
general
unk
horii
and
australian
and
papuan
land
forces
under
command
of
new
guinea
force
.


The
Japanese
objective
was
to
seize
Port
Moresby
by
an
overland
advance
from
the
north
coast
,
following
the
Kokoda
Track
over
the
mountains
of
the
Owen
Stanley
Range
,
as
part
of
a
strategy
to
isolate
Australia
from
the
United
States
.


Japanese
forces
landed
and
established
beachheads
near
Gona
and
Buna
on
21
July
1942
.


Opposed
by
Maroubra
Force
,
then
consisting
of
four
platoons
of
the
39th
Battalion
and
elements
of
the
Papuan
Infantry
Battalion
,
they
quickly
advanced
and
captured
Kokoda
and
its
strategically
vital
airfield
on
29
July
.


Despite
reinforcement
,
the
Australian
forces
were
continually
pushed
back
.


The
veteran
Second
Australian
Imperial
Force
(
AIF
)
21st
Brigade
narrowly
avoided
capture
in
the
Battle
of
Mission
Ridge
–
Brigade
Hill
from
6
to
8
September
.


In
the
Battle
of
Ioribaiwa
from
13
to
16
September
,
the
25th
Brigade
under
Brigadier
Kenneth
Eather
fought
the
Japanese
to
a
halt
but
ceded
the
field
to
the
Japanese
,
withdrawing
back
to
Imita
Ridge
.


The
Japanese
advanced
to
within
sight
of
Port
Moresby
but
withdrew
on
26
September
.


They
had
outrun
their
supply
line
and
had
been
ordered
to
withdraw
in
consequence
of
reverses
suffered
at
Guadalcanal
.


The
Australian
pursuit
encountered
strong
opposition
from
well-prepared
positions
around
Templeton
's
Crossing
and
Eora
Village
from
11
to
28
October
.


Following
the
unopposed
recapture
of
Kokoda
,
a
major
battle
was
fought
around
Oivi
and
Gorari
from
4
to
11
November
,
resulting
in
a
victory
for
the
Australians
.


By
16
November
,
two
brigades
of
the
Australian
7th
Division
had
crossed
the
Kumusi
River
at
Wairopi
,
and
advanced
on
the
Japanese
beachheads
in
a
joint
Australian
and
United
States
operation
.


The
Japanese
forces
at
Buna–Gona
held
out
until
22
January
1943
.


Australian
reinforcement
was
hampered
by
the
logistical
problems
of
supporting
a
force
in
isolated
,
mountainous
,
jungle
terrain
.


There
were
few
planes
available
for
aerial
resupply
,
and
techniques
for
it
were
still
primitive
.


Australian
command
considered
that
the
Vickers
machine
gun
and
medium
mortars
were
too
heavy
to
carry
and
would
be
ineffective
in
the
jungle
terrain
.


Without
artillery
,
mortars
or
medium
machine
guns
,
the
Australians
faced
an
opponent
equipped
with
mountain
guns
and
light
howitzers
that
had
been
carried
into
the
mountains
and
proved
to
be
a
decisive
advantage
.


Australian
forces
were
unprepared
to
conduct
a
campaign
in
the
jungle
environment
of
New
Guinea
.


The
lessons
learned
during
the
course
of
this
campaign
and
the
subsequent
battle
of
Buna–Gona
led
to
widespread
changes
in
doctrine
,
training
,
equipment
and
structure
,
with
a
legacy
that
remains
until
the
present
day
.


In
consequence
of
the
rapid
Japanese
advance
and
the
perceived
failure
to
quickly
counterattack
,
a
``
crisis
of
command
''
resulted
,
in
which
manoeuvring
by
General
Douglas
MacArthur
,
Supreme
Commander
of
Allied
Forces
in
the
South
West
Pacific
Area
,
and
General
Sir
Thomas
Blamey
,
commander
of
Allied
Land
Forces
,
resulted
in
the
sackings
of
three
high-ranking
Australian
officers
.


The
generalship
of
MacArthur
and
Blamey
has
been
criticised
for
unreasonable
and
unrealistic
perceptions
of
the
terrain
and
conditions
under
which
the
campaign
was
fought—to
the
detriment
of
the
troops
committed
to
the
fighting
.


The
Kokoda
Track
campaign
has
been
mythologised
as
Australia
's
Thermopylae
and
incorporated
into
the
Anzac
legend
even
though
the
premise
of
a
vastly
numerically-superior
enemy
has
since
been
shown
to
be
incorrect
.

railroad
disaster
(
also
called
the
Ashtabula
horror
or
the
Ashtabula
Bridge
disaster
or
the
Ashtabula
train
disaster
)
was
a
derailment
caused
by
the
failure
of
a
bridge
over
the
Ashtabula
River
about
from
the
railroad
station
at
Ashtabula
,
in
far
northeastern
Ohio

On
December
29
,
1876
,
at
about
7:30
pm
,
two
locomotives
hauling
11
railcars
of
the
Lake
Shore
and
Michigan
Southern
Railway
carrying
159
passengers
plunged
into
the
river
in
deep
snow
when
the
bridge
gave
way
beneath
them
.


The
wooden
cars
were
set
alight
by
their
heating
stoves
,
but
no
attempt
was
made
to
extinguish
the
fire
.


The
accident
killed
92
people

gospel
singer
and
hymn-writer
Philip
Bliss
and
his
wife
,
and
was
the
worst
rail
accident
in
the
U.S.
in
the
19th
century
and
until
the
Great
Train
Wreck
of
1918
.


The
coroner
's
report
found
that
the
bridge
,
designed
by
the
railroad
company
president
,
had
been
improperly
designed
and
inadequately
inspected
.


As
a
result
of
the
accident
a
hospital
was
built
in
the
town
and
a
federal
system
set
up
to
formally
investigate
fatal
railroad
accidents
.


An
earthquake
,
rated
at
VII
(
``
Very
strong
''
)
on
the
Mercalli
intensity
scale
,
struck
northern
Italy
and
Germany
on
3
January
1117
.


The
epicentre
of
the
first
shock
was
near
Verona
,
the
city
which
suffered
the
most
damage
.


The
outer
wall
of
the
was
partially
felled
,
and
the
standing
portion
was
damaged
in
a
later
earthquake
of
1183
.


Many
other
churches
,
monasteries
,
and
ancient
monuments
were
destroyed
or
seriously
damaged
,
eliminating
much
of
Verona
's
early
medieval
architecture
and
providing
space
for
a
massive
Romanesque
rebuilding
.


After
the
first
shock
of
3
January
,
seismic
activity
persisted
for
months
,
striking
on
12
January
,
4
June
,
1
July
,
1
October
,
and
30
December
.


The
earthquake
was
not
only
felt
in
Verona
but
across
northern
Italy
,
from
Cividale
to
Pavia
,
south
to
Pisa
and
north
to
Switzerland
.


Outside
of
Verona
the
most
damaged
areas
were
Milan
,
Bergamo
,
Brescia
,
Venice
,
Treviso
,
Modena
,
Parma
,
and
Cremona
.


The
main
churches
of
Padua
all
suffered
major
damage
.


News
of
the
earthquake
reached
Montecassino
and
Reims
.


The
Milanese
chronicler
Landolfo
Iuniore
reported
that
the
church
synods
needed
to
be
carried
out
in
the
open
air
,
due
to
the
destruction
.


In
Germany
,
damage
was
also
extensive
.


The
Michaelskirche
in
Bamberg
,
the
abbey
at
Brauweiler
,
and
buildings
in
Rottenburg
am
Neckar
,
Constance
,
Meersburg
,
and
Fénis
were
all
reported
damaged
.


Recent
studies
,
however
,
suggest
that
it
was
not
a
major
,
single
event
on
3
January
,
but
instead
a
series
of
shocks
in
the
areas
of
Verona
(
west
Veneto
)
and
Cremona
(
Lower
Lombardy
)
,
which
happened
in
a
few
days
or
even
in
a
few
hours
.


Other
earthquakes
may
have
hit
as
far
south
as
Pisa
(
northwest
Tuscany
)
and
as
north
as
Augsburg
(
southwest
Bavaria
)
,
as
distinct
events
,
in
the
same
days
.


the
1966
palomares
b-52
crash
,
or
the
palomares
incident
,
occurred
on
17
january
1966
,
when
a
b-52g
bomber
of
the
united
states
air
force
's
strategic
air
command
collided
with
a
kc-135
tanker
during
mid-air
refueling
at
over
the
mediterranean
sea
,
off
the
coast
of
spain
.


The
KC-135
was
completely
destroyed
when
its
fuel
load
ignited
,
killing
all
four
crew
members
.


The
B-52G
broke
apart
,
killing
three
of
the
seven
crew
members
aboard
.


Of
the
four
Mk28-type
hydrogen
bombs
the
B-52G
carried
,
three
were
found
on
land
near
the
small
fishing
village
of
Palomares
in
the
municipality
of
Cuevas
del
Almanzora
,
Almería
,
Spain
.


The
non-nuclear
explosives
in
two
of
the
weapons
detonated
upon
impact
with
the
ground
,
resulting
in
the
contamination
of
a
area
by
plutonium
.


The

Sea
,
was
recovered
intact
after

Bloody
Friday
is
the
name
given
to
the
bombings
by
the
Provisional
Irish
Republican
Army
(
IRA
)
in
Belfast
on
21
July
1972
,
during
the
Troubles
.


At
least
twenty
bombs
exploded
in
the
space
of
eighty
minutes
,
most
within
a
half
hour
period
.


Most
of
them
were
car
bombs
and
most
targeted
infrastructure
,
especially
the
transport
network
.


Nine
people
were
killed
:
five
civilians
,
two
British
soldiers
,
a
Royal
Ulster
Constabulary
(
RUC
)
reservist
,
and
an
Ulster
Defence
Association
(
UDA
)
member
,
while
130
were
injured
.


The
IRA
said
it
sent
telephoned
warnings
at
least
thirty
minutes
before
each
explosion
and
claimed
the
security
forces
wilfully
ignored
some
of
the
warnings
for
its
own
ends
.


The
security
forces
denied
this
and
said
they
were
overstretched
by
the
sheer
number
of
bombs
and
bomb
warnings
,
some
of
which
were
hoaxes
.


The
bombings
were
partly
a
response
to
the
breakdown
of
talks
between
the
IRA
and
the
British
government
.


since
the
beginning
of
its
campaign
in
1970
,
the
ira
had
carried
out
a
bombing
campaign
against
economic
,
military
and
political
targets
in
northern
ireland
.


It
carried
out
a
total
of
1,300
bombings
in
1972
.


However
,
Bloody
Friday
was
a
major
setback
for
the
IRA
and
there
was
a
backlash
against
the
organization
.


Immediately
after
the
bombings
,
the
security
forces
carried
out
numerous
raids
on
the
homes
of
Republicans
.


Ten
days
later
,
the
British
Army
launched
Operation
Motorman
,
in
which
it
re-took
the
no-go
areas
controlled
by
Republicans
.


Loyalist
paramilitaries
also
reacted
to
the
bombings
by
carrying
out
'revenge
'
attacks
on
Catholic
civilians
.


On
the
thirtieth
anniversary
of
the
bombings
,
the
IRA
formally
apologized
to
the
families
of
all
the
civilians
it
had
killed
and
injured
.


The
2011
Mastung
bus
shooting
was
an
armed
attack
on
20
September
2011
on
a
bus
traveling
in
Mastung
District
near
the
city
of
Quetta
in
the
Pakistani
province
of
Balochistan
.


The
attack
left
at
least
26
people
dead
.


The
victims
were
Shi
'
a
Muslim
pilgrims
of
the
Hazara
community
,
suggesting
the
attack
to
have
been
a
targeted
killing
of
sectarian
nature
.


The
attack
occurred
in
Luck
Pass
area
near
Mastung
.


The
bus
was
leaving
Quetta
for
Taftan
,
Balochistan
.


In
addition
,
2
others
were
killed
in
a
follow-up
attack
on
a
car
on
its
way
to
rescue
the
survivors
of
the
bus
attack
,
which
raised
the
death
toll
to
28
on
that
day
.


Lashkar-e-Jhangvi
,
a
Sunni
extremist
Pakistani
militant
group
designated
as
a
terrorist
organization
by
Pakistan
and
the
United
States
claimed
responsibility
for
the
attack
.


The
Tokyo
subway
sarin
attack
(
)
was
an
act
of
domestic
terrorism
perpetrated
on
20
March
1995
,
in
Tokyo
,
Japan
,
by
members
of
the
cult
movement
Aum
Shinrikyo
.


In
five
coordinated
attacks
,
the
perpetrators
released
sarin
on
three
lines
of
the
Tokyo
Metro
(
then
part
of
the
Tokyo
subway
)
during
rush
hour
,
killing
13
people
,
severely
injuring
50
(
some
of
whom
later
died
)
,
and
causing
temporary
vision
problems
for
nearly
1,000
others
.


The
attack
was
directed
against
trains
passing
through
Kasumigaseki
and
Nagatachō
,
where
the
Diet
(
Japanese
parliament
)
is
headquartered
in
Tokyo
.


The
group
,
led
by
Shoko
Asahara
,
had
already
carried
out
several
assassinations
and
terrorist
attacks
using
sarin
,
including
the
Matsumoto
sarin
attack
nine
months
earlier
.


They
had
also
produced
several
other
nerve
agents
,
including
VX
,
and
attempted
to
produce
botulinum
toxin
and
had
perpetrated
several
failed
acts
of
bioterrorism
.


Asahara
had
been
made
aware
of
a
police
raid
scheduled
for
March
22
and
had
planned
the
Tokyo
subway
attack
in
order
to
hinder
police
investigations
into
the
cult
and
perhaps
spark
the
apocalypse
they
believed
in
.


In
the
raid
following
the
attack
,
police
arrested
many
senior
members
of
the
cult
.


Police
activity
continued
throughout
the
summer
,
and
over
200
members
were
arrested
,
including
Asahara
.


Thirteen
of
the
senior
Aum
management
were
sentenced
to
death
and
later
executed
;
many
others
were
given
prison
sentences
up
to
life
.


The
attack
remains
the
deadliest
terrorist
incident
in
Japan
as
defined
by
modern
standards
.


On
30
April
2014
,
a
knife
attack

The
incident
,
a

attack
,
left
three
people
dead
and
seventy-nine
others
injured
.


the
attack

the
conclusion
of
a
visit
by
xi

general
secretary
of
the
communist
party
of
china
to
the
region
.


At
approximately
7:10
pm
local
time
,
a
pair
of
assailants
attacked
passengers
with
knives
and
detonated
explosives
at

station
.


Police
closed
off
all
entrances
to
the
station
in
the
immediate
aftermath
of
the
attack
,
but
it
was
reopened
at
9
PM
with
increased
security
.


It
is
not
known
how
many
individuals
were
involved

in
which
two
consecutive
explosions
on

sidewalk
near
the
finish
line
killed
three
spectators
and
injured

The
attack
received
widespread
international

crashed
shortly
after
takeoff
into

.


All
260

(
251
passengers
and
9
crew

)
were
killed
,
along
with

It
is
the

and
the
second-deadliest
aviation
accident
in

.


The
location
of
the
accident
and
the
fact
that
it
took
place
two
months
and
one
day
after
the
September
11
attacks
on
the
World
Trade
Center
in
Manhattan
initially
spawned
fears
of
another
terrorist
attack
.


terrorism
was
officially
ruled
out
as
the
cause
by
the
national
transportation
safety
board
(
ntsb
)
,
which
instead
attributed
the
disaster
to
the
first
officer
's
overuse
of
rudder
controls
in
response
to
wake
turbulence
from
a
japan

that
took
off
minutes
before
it
.


According
to
the
NTSB
,
the
aggressive
use
of
the
rudder
controls
by
the
first
officer
stressed
the
vertical

until
it
snapped

The
2006
Madrid–Barajas
Airport
bombing
occurred
on
30
December
2006
when
a
van
bomb
exploded
in
the
Terminal
4
parking
area
at
the
Madrid–Barajas
Airport
in
Spain
,
killing
two
and
injuring
52
.


On
9
January
2007
,
the
terrorist
organisation
ETA
claimed
responsibility
for
the
attack
.


The
attack
,
one
of
the
most
powerful
carried
out
by
ETA
,
damaged
the
airport
terminal
and
destroyed
the
entire
parking
structure
.


The
bombing
ended
a
nine-month
ceasefire
declared
by
the
armed
organisation
and
prompted
the
government
to
halt
plans
for
negotiations
with
the
organisation
.


Despite
the
attack
,
ETA
claimed
that
the
ceasefire
was
still
in
place
and
regretted
the
death
of
civilians
.


The
organisation
eventually
announced
the
end
of
the
ceasefire
in
June
2007
.


Ordered
and
planned
by
then
head
of
commandos
Miguel
Garikoitz
Aspiazu
Rubina
alias
Txeroki
,
the
attack
was
carried
out
by
the
``
commando
Elurra
''
,
whose
members
were
arrested
in
early
2008
and
sentenced
for
the
attack
in
May
2010

Txeroki
was
arrested
in

people
(
not
counting
the
19

—all
of
which

hijacked
by

al-Qaeda
terrorists
.


Two
of
the

.


Within
an
hour
and
42
minutes
,
both

Debris
and
the
resulting

9/11
is
the
single
deadliest
terrorist
attack
in
human
history
and
the
single
deadliest
incident
for
firefighters
and
law
enforcement
officers
in
the
history
of
the
United
States
,
with
343
and
72
killed
,
respectively
.


Suspicion
quickly
fell
on
al-Qaeda
.


The
United
States
responded
by
launching
the
War
on
Terror
and
invading
Afghanistan
to
depose
the
Taliban
,
which
had
failed
to
comply
with
U.S.
demands
to
extradite
Osama
bin
Laden
and
expel
al-Qaeda
from
Afghanistan
.


Many
countries
strengthened
their
anti-terrorism
legislation
and
expanded
the
powers
of
law
enforcement
and
intelligence
agencies
to
prevent
terrorist
attacks
.


although
osama
bin
laden
,
al-qaeda
's
leader
,
initially
denied
any
involvement
,
in
2004
he
claimed
responsibility
for
the
attacks
.


Al-Qaeda
and
bin
Laden
cited
U.S.
support
of
Israel
,
the
presence
of
U.S.
troops
in
Saudi
Arabia
,
and
sanctions
against
Iraq
as
motives
.


After
evading
capture
for
almost
a
decade
,
bin
Laden
was
located
in
Pakistan
and
killed
by
SEAL
Team
Six
of
the
U.S.
Navy
in
May
2011
.


The
destruction
of
the
World
Trade
Center
and
nearby
infrastructure
seriously
harmed
the
economy
of

although
not
confirmed
,
there
is
evidence
of
alleged
saudi
arabian
involvement
in
the
attacks
.


given
as
main
evidence
in
these
charges
are
the
contents
of
the
28
redacted
pages
of
the
december
2002
joint
inquiry
into
intelligence
community
activities
before

after
the

,
conducted
by
the
senate
select
committee
on
intelligence
and
the

information
regarding

material
and
financial
assistance
given
to
the
hijackers
and
their
affiliates
leading
up
to
the
attacks
by
the
Saudi
Arabian
government
.


As
a

been
in

ever

The
Christianization
of
Bulgaria
was
the
process
by
which
9th-century
medieval
Bulgaria
converted
to
Christianity
.


It
reflected
the
need
of
unity
within
the
religiously
divided
Bulgarian
state
as
well
as
the
need
for
equal
acceptance
on
the
international
stage
in
Christian
Europe
.


This
process
was
characterized
by
the
shifting
political
alliances
of
Boris
I
of
Bulgaria
(
ruled
852-889
)
with
the
kingdom
of
the
East
Franks
and
with
the
Byzantine
Empire
,
as
well
as
his
diplomatic
correspondence
with
the
Pope
.


Because
of
Bulgaria
's
strategic
position
,
the
churches
of
both
Rome
and
Constantinople
each
wanted
Bulgaria
in
their
sphere
of
influence
.


They
regarded
Christianization
as
a
means
of
integrating
Slavs
into
their
region
.


After
some
overtures
to
each
side
,
the
Khan
adopted
Christianity
from
Constantinople
in
870
.


As
a
result
,
he
achieved
his
goal
of
gaining
an
independent
Bulgarian
national
church
and
having
an
archbishop
appointed
to
head
it
.


The
Irish
Confederate
Wars
,
also
called
the
Eleven
Years
'
War
(
derived
from
the
Irish
language
name
``
Cogadh
na
hAon
Bhliana
Déag
''
)
,
took
place
in
Ireland
between
1641
and
1653
.


It
was
the
Irish
theatre
of
the
Wars
of
the
Three
Kingdoms
–
a
series
of
civil
wars
in
the
kingdoms
of
Ireland
,
England
and
Scotland
(
all
ruled
by
Charles
I
)
.


The
war
in
Ireland
began
with
a
rebellion
in
1641
by
Irish
Catholics
,
who
tried
to
seize
control
of
the
English
administration
in
Ireland
to
force
concessions
for
Catholics
.


This
developed
into
an
ethnic
conflict
between
Gaelic
Irish
and
old
English
Catholics
on
one
side
,
and
English
and
Scottish
Protestant
colonists
on
the
other
.


Catholic
leaders
formed
the
Irish
Catholic
Confederation
in
1642
,
which
controlled
most
of
Ireland
and
was
loosely
aligned
with
the
Royalists
.


The
Confederates
and
Royalists
fought
against
the
English
Parliamentarians
and
Scottish
Covenanters
.


In
1649
,
a
Parliamentarian
army
led
by
Oliver
Cromwell
invaded
Ireland
and
by
1653
had
conquered
the
island
.


The
war
was
both
a
religious
and
an
ethnic
conflict
–
fought
over
who
would
govern
Ireland
,
whether
it
would
be
governed
from
England
,
which
ethnic
and
religious
group
would
own
most
of
the
land
,
and
which
religion
would
predominate
in
the
country
.


It
was
the
most
destructive
conflict
in
Irish
history
.


The
Wonderland
murders
,
also
known
as
the
Four
on
the
Floor
Murders
or
the
Laurel
Canyon
Murders
,
are
four
unsolved
murders
that
occurred
in
Los
Angeles
,
California
,
USA
on
July
1
,
1981
.


It
is
assumed
that
five
people
were
targeted
to
be
killed
in
the
known
drug
house
of
the
Wonderland
Gang
,
three
of
whom
were
present
.


All
three
of
them
,
Ron
Launius
,
Billy
DeVerell
,
and
Joy
Miller
,
along
with
their
accomplice
Barbara
Richardson
,
died
from
extensive
blunt-force
trauma
injuries
.


Only
Launius
'
wife
,
Susan
Launius
,
survived
the
attack
,
allegedly
masterminded
by
the
organized
crime
figure
and
nightclub
owner
Eddie
Nash
.


Nash
,
his
henchman
Gregory
Diles
,
and
porn
star
John
Holmes
were
at
various
times
arrested
,
tried
,
and
acquitted
for
their
involvement
in
the
murders
.


LAPD
detectives
are
on
record
saying
the
crime
scene
was
bloodier
and
more
gruesome
than
that
of
the
Tate-LaBianca
murders
.


The
Arab
Revolt
(
,
;
)
or
Great
Arab
Revolt
(
,
)
was
a
military
uprising
of
Arab
forces
against
the
Ottoman
Empire
in
the
Middle
Eastern
theatre
of
World
War
I
.


On
the
basis
of
the
McMahon–Hussein
Correspondence
,
an
agreement
between
the
British
government
and
Hussein
bin
Ali
,
Sharif
of
Mecca
,
the
revolt
was
officially
initiated
at
Mecca
on
June
10
,
1916
.


The
aim
of
the
revolt
was
to
create
a
single
unified
and
independent
Arab
state
stretching
from
Aleppo
in
Syria
to
Aden
in
Yemen
,
which
the
British
had
promised
to
recognize
.


The
Sharifian
Army
led
by
Hussein
and
the
Hashemites
,
with
the
military
backing
from
the
British
Empire
and
the
British
Egyptian
Expeditionary
Force
,
successfully
battled
and
repelled
the
Ottoman
military
presence
from
much
of
the
Hejaz
and
Transjordan
.


The
rebellion
eventually
took
Damascus
and
set
up
a
short-lived
monarchy
led
by
Faisal
,
a
son
of
Hussein
.


The
Middle
East
was
later
partitioned
by
the
Britain
and
France
into
mandate
territories
,
and
the
British
were
accused
of
reneging
on
their
promise
to
support
a
unified
independent
Arab
state
.


The
May
Uprising
took
place
in
Dresden
,
Kingdom
of
Saxony
in
1849
;
it
was
one
of
the
last
of
the
series
of
events
known
as
the
Revolutions
of
1848
.


Events
leading
to
the
May
Uprising
.


In
the
German
states
,
revolutions
began
in
March
1848
,
starting
in
Berlin
and
spreading
across
the
other
states
which
now
make
up
Germany
.


the
heart
of
the
revolutions
was
in
frankfurt
,
where
the
newly
formed
national
assembly
,
the
frankfurt
parliament
,
met
in
st
paul
's
church
from
may
1848
,
calling
for
a
constitutional
monarchy
to
rule
a
new
,
united
german
nation
.


to
form
the
assembly
,
unk
elections
had
taken
place
across
the
german
states
;
the
majority
of
the
members
were
saxon
democrats
.


on
28
march
1849
the
assembly
passed
the
first
``
unk
''
(
constitution
)
for
germany
,
and
in
april
1849
,
friedrich
wilhelm
iv
of
prussia
was
offered
the
crown
.


despite
its
apparent
progress
,
the
national
assembly
really
depended
upon
the
co-operation
of
the
old
leaders
and
emperor
;
this
became
all
too
clear
when
friedrich
wilhelm
iv
refused
to
accept
the
crown
in
disgust
.


movements
sprang
up
across
the
german
states
to
force
through
the
new
constitution
but
the
national
assembly
disintegrated
.


In
Saxony
,
Frederick
Augustus
II
had
never
recognised
the
constitution
,
and
now
also
disbanded
the
Saxon
parliament
.


in
UNK
the
more
radical
elements
of
the
national
assembly
formed
a
rump
parliament
in
stuttgart
,
which
was
defeated
by
prussian
troops
.


at
the
same
time
,
the
people
of
saxony
began
to
react
to
the
repression
of
the
democratic
movement
UNK
the
may
uprising
began
.


The
Tesco
bomb
campaign
was
an
attempted
extortion
against
British
supermarket
chain
Tesco
which
started
in
Bournemouth
,
England
,
in
August
2000
and
led
to
one
of
the
largest
and
most
secretive
operations
ever
undertaken
by
Dorset
Police
.


During
the
campaign
,
a
blackmailer
identified
by
the
pseudonym
``
Sally
''
sent
letters
to
Tesco
stores
threatening
to
harm
customers
if
his
demands
,
for
Clubcards
modified
so
that
the
holder
could
withdraw
cash
from
ATMs
,
were
not
met
.


Several
months
after
the
threat
first
came
to
light
,
``
Sally
''
sent
out
several
letter
bombs
,
one
of
which
was
received
and
exploded
in
the
face
of
the
householder
,
causing
her
shock
and
minor
injuries
,
while
the
Royal
Mail
intercepted
several
other
packages
,
which
had
been
held
up
because
insufficient
stamps
had
been
put
on
them
.


In
October
2000
,
``
Sally
''
threatened
to
use
pipe
bombs
against
Tesco
customers
and
the
threat
was
taken
seriously
enough
that
Tesco
began
the
production
of
the
modified
Clubcards
,
but
were
unable
to
produce
the
required
number
before
the
deadline
set
by
the
blackmailer
.


In
November
,
``
Sally
''
claimed
to
have
placed
a
pipe
bomb
in
a
garden
in
the
Ferndown
area
of
Dorset
.


No
bomb
was
found
.


Police
eventually
mounted
a
surveillance
operation
on
the
postbox
to
which
several
of
the
extortion
letters
had
been
traced
and
identified
``
Sally
''
as
Robert
Edward
Dyer
.


Dyer
was
arrested
in
February
2001
,
over
six
months
since
the
beginning
of
the
extortion
attempt
,
and
charged
with
several
offences
,
including
nine
counts
of
blackmail
and
one
of
common
assault
,
of
which
he
was
found
guilty
in
May
2001
.


He
was
sentenced
to
16-years
imprisonment
on
12
June
2001
,
later
reduced
to
12
on
appeal
.


A
number
of
similar
extortion
attempts
against
supermarket
chains
and
other
businesses
and
subsequent
attacks
on
Tesco
have
since
been
compared
to
Dyer
's
campaign
by
the
media
.


The
Erdut
killings
were
a
series
of
murders
of
37
Hungarian
and
Croat
civilians

1991
and
June
1992
,
during
the
Croatian
War
of
Independence
.


Twenty-two
Hungarians
and
15
Croats
were

died
.


Eight
more

killed
over
the
following
several
days
.


Five
more
civilians

December
,
and
another
seven
on

December
.


Four
others
were
killed
on
21
February
1992
and
the
final
one
was
killed
on
3
June
.


The
bodies
of
these
victims
were
either
buried
in
mass
graves
or
thrown
into
nearby
wells
.


most
of
the
victims
were
exhumed
in
1998
,
after
the
area
reverted
to
croatian
control
following
the
signing
of
the
erdut
agreement
in
1995
.


The
International
Criminal
Tribunal
for
the
former

Croatian
Serb
officials
,
including
Slobodan
Milošević
,
Jovica
Stanišić
,
Franko
Simatović
and
Goran
Hadžić
,
for
their
alleged
involvement
in
the
killings
.


Milošević
and
Hadžić
died
before
their
trials
could
be
completed
.


Stanišić
and
Simatović
were
initially
acquitted
,
but
their
acquittals
were
overturned
on
appeal
,
and
they
are
being
retried
.

at
Trnopolje
,
were
separated
out
from

were
reported
in
a

of
articles
published
by
the
Bosnian

at
this

The
move
was
criticized
by
the
South

move
away
from
orthodox
communism
by
emphasizing
the
``

included
cities
where
gaga
had
canceled
shows
of
her
previous
born
this
way
ball
tour
after
suffering
a
hip
injury
.


The
ArtRave
tour
was
preceded
by
a
performance
at
the
South
by
Southwest
music
festival
,
which
drew
controversy
due
to
a
segment
where
an
artist
vomited
on
Gaga
,
and
a
seven-day
residency
at
the
Roseland
Ballroom
in
Manhattan
,
New
York
.


ArtRave
's
concept
and
name
are
derived
from
the
similarly
named
release
party
for
``
Artpop
''
.


The
stage
resembled
a
cave
and
consisted
of
two
sections
connected
by
catwalks
made
of
translucent
lucite
,
allowing
the
audience
to
move
underneath
the
catwalks
while
still
being
able
to
watch
the
show
.


Gaga
's
costumes
in
the
show
included
one
with
tentacles
,
one
with
bejeweled
wings
,
a
rave-inspired
outfit
and
a
necklace
made
of
marijuana
leaves
.

designers

choreographers
aspired
to
make
a
single
,
coherent
show
.


The
lighting
fixtures
used
for
the
concert
were
from
Clay
Paky
and
the
main
idea
was
to
create
an
immersive
rave
experience
with
the
lights
.


They
were
also
designed
to
accommodate
minor
changes
in
the
show
sequences
.


The
tour

produced
by
Live
Nation
,
and
promoted
by
Absolut
Vodka

Kingdom
.

for
several
shows
sold
out
immediately
once
available
,
prompting
additional
dates
.


Negative
reports
about
the
tour
's
commercial
performance
were
dismissed
by
Live
Nation
chairman
Arthur
Fogel
.

placed
within

The
Ogaden
War
was
a
Somali
military
offensive
between
July
1977
and
March
1978
over
the
disputed
Ethiopian
region
of
Ogaden
,
which
began
with
the
Somali
invasion
of
Ethiopia
.


The
Soviet
Union
disapproved
of
the
invasion
and
ceased
its
support
of
Somalia
,
instead
starting
to
support
Ethiopia
;
the
United
States
,
conversely
,
ceased
its
support
of
Ethiopia
and
started
supporting
Somalia
.


Ethiopia
was
saved
from
a
major
defeat
and
a
permanent
loss
of
territory
through
a
massive
airlift
of
military
supplies
(
worth
$
7
billion
)
,
the
arrival
of
16,000
Cuban
troops
,
1,500
Soviet
advisors
and
two
brigades
from
South
Yemen
,
also
airlifted
to
reinforce
Harar
.


The
Ethiopians
prevailed
at
Harar
,
Dire
Dawa
and
Jijiga
,
and
began
to
push
the
Somalis
systematically
out
of
the
Ogaden
.


By
March
1978
,
the
Ethiopians
had
captured
almost
all
of
the
Ogaden
,
prompting
the
defeated
Somalis
to
give
up
their
claim
to
the
region
.


A
third
of
the
initial
Somali
National
Army
invasion
force
was
killed
,
and
half
of
the
Somali
Airforce
destroyed
;
the
war
left
Somalia
with
a
disorganized
and
demoralized
army
and
an
angry
population
.


All
of
these
conditions
led
to
a
revolt
in
the
army
which
eventually
spiraled
into
a
civil
war
and
Somalia
's
current
situation
.


Between
1
and
15
August
2014
,
the
Islamic

northern
Iraqi
territories
under

conquered

Qaraqosh

,
Karamlish
,
Bartella
and
Makhmour
.


The
offensive
resulted
in
100,000
Iraqi
Christians
driven
from
their
homes
,
200,000
Yazidi
civilians
driven
from
their
homes
in
the
city
of
Sinjar
,
5,000
Yazidi
men
massacred
,
5,000–7,000
Yazidi
women
enslaved
,
and
a
air
campaign
by
several
Western
countries
against
ISIL
.


In
the
opinion
of
a
member
of
the
Iraqi
Kurdistan
Regional
Government
,
ISIL
's
August
campaign
against
Sinjar
was
more
about
demography
and
strategy
than
about
religion
:
ISIL
wanted
to
push
most
of
the
Kurds
out
of
this
strategic
Kurdish
area
and
bring
in
Arabs
who
were
obedient
to
ISIL
.


50,000
of
Sinjar
's
Yazidis
took
refuge
in
the
adjacent
Sinjar
Mountains
,
where
they
lacked
food
,
water
and
other
basic
necessities
.


35,000
to
45,000
of
them
were
evacuated
within
several
weeks
,
after
the
United
States
bombed
ISIL
positions
and
efforts
from
Kurdish
PKK
,
YPG
and
Peshmerga
forces
assisted
their
escape
.


Some
ISIL-controlled
territory
was
retaken
;
a
subsequent
Kurdish
counter-attack
recaptured
the
Mosul
Dam
and
several
other
nearby
towns
.


The
American
Revolutionary
War
(
17751783
)
,
also
known
as
the
American
War
of
Independence
,
was
an
18th-century
war
between
Great
Britain
and
its
Thirteen
Colonies
which
declared
independence
in
1776
as
the
United
States
of
America
,
and
then
formed
a
military
alliance
with
France
in
1778
.


After
1765
,
growing
constitutional
and
political
differences
strained
the
relationship
between
Great
Britain
and
its
colonies
.


Patriot
protests
against
taxation
without
representation
followed
the
Stamp
Act
and
escalated
into
boycotts
,
which
culminated
in
1773
with
the
Sons
of
Liberty
destroying
a
shipment
of
tea
in
Boston
Harbor
.


Britain
responded
by
closing
Boston
Harbor
and
passing
a
series
of
punitive
measures
against
Massachusetts
Bay
Colony
.


Massachusetts
colonists
responded
with
the
Suffolk
Resolves
,
and
they
established
a
shadow
government
which
wrested
control
of
the
countryside
from
the
Crown
.


Twelve
colonies
formed
a
Continental
Congress
(
with
the
exception
of
Georgia
)
to
coordinate
their
resistance
,
establishing
committees
and
conventions
that
effectively
seized
power
.


British
attempts
to
disarm
the
Massachusetts
militia
in
Concord
led
to
open
combat
and
a
British
defeat
on
April
19
,
1775
.


Militia
forces
then
besieged
Boston
,
forcing
a
British
evacuation
in
March
1776
,
and
Congress
appointed
George
Washington
to
command
the
Continental
Army
.


Concurrently
,
the
Americans
failed
decisively
in
an
attempt
to
invade
Quebec
and
raise
insurrection
against
the
British
.


On
July
2
,
1776
,
the
Second
Continental
Congress
voted
for
independence
,
issuing
its
declaration
on
July
4
.


Sir
William
Howe
launched
a
British
counter-offensive
,
capturing
New
York
City
and
leaving
American
morale
at
a
low
ebb
.


However
,
victories
at
Trenton
and
Princeton
restored
American
confidence
.


In
1777
,
the
British
launched
an
invasion
from
Quebec
under
John
Burgoyne
,
intending
to
isolate
the
New
England
Colonies
.


Instead
of
assisting
this
effort
,
Howe
took
his
army
on
a
separate
campaign
against
Philadelphia
,
and
Burgoyne
was
decisively
defeated
at
Saratoga
in
October
1777
.


Burgoyne
's
defeat
had
drastic
consequences
.


France
formally
allied
with
the
Americans
and
entered
the
war
in
1778
,
and
Spain
joined
the
war
the
following
year
as
an
ally
of
France
but
not
as
an
ally
of
the
United
States
.


In
1780
,
the
Kingdom
of
Mysore
attacked
the
British
in
India
,
and
tensions
between
Great
Britain
and
the
Netherlands
erupted
into
open
war
.


In
North
America
,
the
British
mounted
a
``
Southern
strategy
''
led
by
Charles
Cornwallis
which
hinged
upon
a
Loyalist
uprising
,
but
too
few
came
forward
.


Cornwallis
suffered
reversals
at
King
's
Mountain
and
Cowpens
.


He
retreated
to
Yorktown
,
Virginia
,
intending
an
evacuation
,
but
a
decisive
French
naval
victory
deprived
him
of
an
escape
.


A
Franco-American
army
led
by
the
Comte
de
Rochambeau
and
Washington
then
besieged
Cornwallis
'
army
and
,
with
no
sign
of
relief
,
he
surrendered
in
October
1781
.


Whigs
in
Britain
had
long
opposed
the
pro-war
Tories
in
Parliament
,
and
the
surrender
gave
them
the
upper
hand
.


In
early
1782
,
Parliament
voted
to
end
all
offensive
operations
in
America
,
but
the
war
continued
overseas
.


Britain
remained
under
siege
in
Gibraltar
but
scored
a
major
victory
over
the
French
navy
.


on
september
3
,
1783
,
the
belligerent
parties
signed
the
treaty
of
paris
in
which
great
britain
agreed
to
recognize
the
sovereignty
of
the
united
states
and
formally
end
the
war
.


French
involvement
had
proven
decisive
,
but
France
made
few
gains
and
incurred
crippling
debts
.


Spain
made
some
territorial
gains
but
failed
in
its
primary
aim
of
recovering
Gibraltar
.


The
Dutch
were
defeated
on
all
counts
and
were
compelled
to
cede
territory
to
Great
Britain
.


In
India
,
the
war
against
Mysore
and
its
allies
concluded
in
1784
without
any
territorial
changes
.


The
1960
Texas
tropical
storm
brought
severe
but
localized
flooding
to
southeastern
Texas
in
June
1960
.


The
first
tropical
cyclone
and
first
tropical
storm
of
the
1960
Atlantic
hurricane
season
,
this
system
developed
from
an
area
of
showers
and
thunderstorms
in
the
Bay
of
Campeche
on
June
22
.


Initially
a
tropical
depression
,
it
strengthened
and
was
estimated
to
have
reached
tropical
storm
status
on
June
23
.


Early
on
the
following
day
,
the
storm
peaked
with
winds
of
60
mph
(
95
km/h
)
.


Later
that
day
,
it
made
landfall
near
Corpus
Christi
,
Texas
,
at
the
same
intensity
.


The
storm
weakened
slowly
and
moved
across
the
Central
United
States
,
before
dissipating
over
Illinois
on
June
28
.


In
Texas
,
the
storm
dropped
up
to
of
precipitation
in
Port
Lavaca
.


Thus
considerable
flooding
occurred
in
some
areas
of
south
and
eastern
Texas
.


Throughout
the
state
,
more
than
150
houses
sustained
flood
damage
in
several
counties
.


In
addition
,
numerous
major
highways
were
closed
,
including
portions
of
U.S
.


Routes
59
,
87
,
90
,
and
then-185
,
and
Texas
State
Highways
35
and
71
.


In
Arkansas
,
a
few
buildings
in
Hot
Springs
were
damaged
from
high
winds
.


Flooding
in
that
state
resulted
in
three
deaths
from
drowning
.


Light
to
moderate
rainfall
was
recorded
in
at
least
11
other
states
,
though
damage
was
minimal
.


The
storm
was
the
rainiest
tropical
cyclone
on
record
in
the
state
of
Kentucky
,
dropping
in
Dunmor
.


Overall
,
18
fatalities
were
attributed
to
the
storm
and
$
3.6
million
(
1960
USD
)
in
damage
was
reported
.


Hurricane
Frances
was
the
second
most
intense
tropical
cyclone
in
the
Atlantic
during
2004
and
proved
to
be
very
destructive
in
Florida
.


It
was
the
sixth
named
storm
,
the
fourth
hurricane
,
and
the
third
major
hurricane
of
the
2004
Atlantic
hurricane
season
.


The
system
crossed
the
open
Atlantic
in
late
August
,
moving
to
the
north
of
the
Lesser
Antilles
while
strengthening
.


Its
outer
bands
struck
Puerto
Rico
and
the
British
Virgin
Islands
while
passing
north
of
the
Caribbean
Sea
.


The
storm
's
maximum
sustained
wind
peaked
at
,
achieving
Category
4
on
the
Saffir-Simpson
Hurricane
Scale
.


As
the
system
's
forward
motion
slowed
,
the
eye
passed
over
San
Salvador
Island
and
very
close
to
Cat
Island
in
the
Bahamas
.


Frances
was
the
first
hurricane
to
impact
the
entire
Bahamian
archipelago
since
1928
and
almost
completely
destroyed
their
agricultural
economy
.


Frances
then
passed
over
the
central
sections
of
Florida
,
three
weeks
after
Hurricane
Charley
,
causing
significant
damage
to
the
state
's
citrus
crop
,
closing
major
airports
and
schools
,
and
forcing
the
cancellation
of
a
collegiate
football
game
.


The
storm
then
moved
briefly
offshore
from
Florida
,
into
the
northeast
Gulf
of
Mexico
,
and
made
a
second
U.S.
landfall
,
on
the
Florida
Panhandle
,
before
accelerating
northeast
through
the
eastern
United
States
near
the
Appalachians
and
into
Atlantic
Canada
while
weakening
.


A
significant
tornado
outbreak
accompanied
the
storm
across
the
eastern
United
States
,
nearly
equaling
the
outbreak
from
Hurricane
Beulah
.


Very
heavy
rains
fell
in
association
with
this
slow-moving
and
relatively
large
hurricane
,
which
caused
floods
in
Florida
and
North
Carolina
.


50
people
died
and
damages
totaled
US
$
10.1
billion
(
2004
dollars
)
.


The
1970
Canada
hurricane
was
an
unnamed
tropical
cyclone
that
brought
impact
to
Bermuda
and
Newfoundland
.


The
fourth
hurricane
and
ninth
tropical
storm
of
the
annual
hurricane
season
,
this
system
developed
northeast
of
the
Bahamas
as
a
subtropical
depression
on
October
12
.


While
tracking
northeastward
,
the
system
intensified
,
becoming
a
subtropical
storm
on
the
following
day
.


The
subtropical
storm
transitioned
into
a
tropical
cyclone
on
October
16
,
and
strengthened
into
a
hurricane
about
twelve
hours
later
.


The
hurricane
later
bypassed
Bermuda
,
before
further
intensifying
into
a
Category
2
hurricane
on
the
Saffir–Simpson
hurricane
wind
scale
.


Thereafter
,
the
hurricane
accelerated
rapidly
northeastward
,
and
made
landfall
on
the
Avalon
Peninsula
of
Newfoundland
as
a
Category
1
hurricane
.


It
transitioned
into
an
extratropical
cyclone
early
on
October
17
.


The
system
produced
tropical
storm
force
winds
on
Bermuda
,
which
caused
the
suspension
of
schools
,
transportation
,
and
interrupted
businesses
,
although
minimal
structural
damage
occurred
.


Light
rainfall
was
also
reported
on
the
island
.


Hurricane
force
winds
were
observed
throughout
Newfoundland
,
which
caused
damage
to
structures
,
though
mostly
limited
to
broken
windows
.


Rough
seas
damaged
fishing
dories
and
a
fishing
ramp
on
the
Atlantic
coast
of
the
island
.


The
cost
of
damage
on
the
Burin
Peninsula
was
estimated
to
be
in
the
thousands
of
dollars
,
although
the
specific
figure
in
unknown
.


Heavy
rainfall
was
also
reported
in
the
region
,
with
precipitation
in
Quebec
reaching
nearly
.


On
the
French
Territory
of
Saint
Pierre
and
Miquelon
,
several
buildings
and
houses
lost
their
roof
due
to
strong
winds
.


The
Mozambican
War
of
Independence
was
an
armed
conflict
between
the
guerrilla
forces
of
the
Mozambique
Liberation
Front
or
FRELIMO
(
Frente
de
Libertação
de
Moçambique
)
,
and
Portugal
.


The
war
officially
started
on
September
25
,
1964
,
and
ended
with
a
ceasefire
on
September
8
,
1974
,
resulting
in
a
negotiated
independence
in
1975
.


Portugal
's
wars
against
independence
guerrilla
fighters
in
its
400-year-old
African
territories
began
in
1961
with
Angola
.


In
Mozambique
,
the
conflict
erupted
in
1964
as
a
result
of
unrest
and
frustration
amongst
many
indigenous
Mozambican
populations
,
who
perceived
foreign
rule
to
be
a
form
of
exploitation
and
mistreatment
,
which
served
only
to
further
Portuguese
economic
interests
in
the
region
.


Many
Mozambicans
also
resented
Portugal
's
policies
towards
indigenous
people
,
which
resulted
in
discrimination
,
traditional
lifestyle
turning
difficult
for
many
Africans
,
and
limited
access
to
Portuguese-style
education
and
skilled
employment
.


As
successful
self-determination
movements
spread
throughout
Africa
after
World
War
II
,
many
Mozambicans
became
progressively
nationalistic
in
outlook
,
and
increasingly
frustrated
by
the
nation
's
continued
subservience
to
foreign
rule
.


For
the
other
side
,
many
enculturated
indigenous
Africans
who
were
fully
integrated
into
the
Portugal-ruled
social
organization
of
Portuguese
Mozambique
,
in
particular
those
from
the
urban
centres
,
reacted
to
the
independentist
claims
with
a
mixture
of
discomfort
and
suspicion
.


The
ethnic
Portuguese
of
the
territory
,
which
included
most
of
the
ruling
authorities
,
responded
with
increased
military
presence
and
fast-paced
development
projects
.


A
mass
exile
of
Mozambique
's
political
intelligentsia
to
neighbouring
countries
provided
havens
from
which
radical
Mozambicans
could
plan
actions
and
foment
political
unrest
in
their
homeland
.


The
formation
of
the
Mozambican
guerrilla
organisation
FRELIMO
and
the
support
of
the
Soviet
Union
,
China
,
Cuba
,
Yugoslavia
,
Bulgaria
,
Tanzania
,
Zambia
,
Egypt
,
Algeria
and
Gaddafi
regime
in
Libya
through
arms
and
advisers
,
led
to
the
outbreak
of
violence
that
was
to
last
over
a
decade
.


From
a
military
standpoint
,
the
Portuguese
regular
army
held
the
upper
hand
during
the
conflict
against
the
independentist
guerrilla
forces
.


Nonetheless
,
Mozambique
succeeded
in
achieving
independence
on
June
25
,
1975
,
after
a
civil
resistance
movement
known
as
the
Carnation
Revolution
backed
by
portions
of
the
military
in
Portugal
overthrew
the
military
dictatorship
,
thus
ending
470
years
of
Portuguese
colonial
rule
in
the
East
African
region
.


according
to
historians
of
the
revolution
,
the
military
coup
in
portugal
was
in
part
fuelled
by
protests
concerning
the
conduct
of
portuguese
troops
in
their
treatment
of
some
local
mozambican
populace
.


The
role
of
the
growing
communist
influence
over
the
group
of
Portuguese
military
insurgents
who
led
the
Lisbon
's
military
coup
,
and
,
on
the
other
hand
,
the
pressure
of
the
international
community
over
the
direction
of
the
Portuguese
Colonial
War
in
general
,
were
main
causes
for
the
final
outcome
.


The
2012
Quebec
student
protests
(
movement
)
were
a
series
of
student
demonstrations
led
by
student
unions
such
as
the
Association
pour
une
solidarité
syndicale
étudiante
(
ASSÉ
)
,
the
Fédération
étudiante
universitaire
du
Québec
,
and
the
Fédération
étudiante
collégiale
du
Québec
against
a
proposal
by
the
Quebec
Cabinet
,
headed
by
Liberal
Premier
Jean
Charest
,
to
raise
university
tuition
from
$
2,168
to
$
3,793
between
2012
and
2018
.


As
part
of
the
protest
movement
,
a
series
of
widespread
student
strikes
were
organized
,
involving
half
of
Quebec
's
student
population
by
April
2012
.


A
third
of
Quebec
students
continued
to
participate
in
the
strike
by
its
100th
day
,
while
a
quarter
million
had
participated
during
its
peak
.


Other
students
continued
to
attend
their
courses
.


Left-wing
groups
endorsed
the
student
protests
,
which
evolved
into
generalized
demonstrations
against
the
provincial
government
.


Opposition
parties
(
Parti
Québécois
,
Québec
solidaire
,
Option
nationale
)
,
workers
unions
(
Confédération
des
syndicats
nationaux
,
Canadian
Union
of
Public
Employees
)
and
many
groups
demonstrated
alongside
the
students
in
April
and
May
2012
.


On
May
18
,
the
Government
passed
Bill
78
,
an
emergency
law
forbidding
picketing
or
protest
near
university
grounds
,
and
requiring
police
approval
for
large
public
protests
anywhere
in
Quebec
.


The
law
was
mainly
repealed
by
the
Marois
government
in
September
2012
and
expired
in
2013
.


In
the
Fall
of
2012
,
with
a
new
school
term
beginning
,
student
participation
in
the
strikes
and
demonstrations
dwindled
.


The
Quebec
nationalist
Parti
Québécois
was
later
elected
as
minority
government
and
halted
any
tuition
increases
in
line
with
its
campaign
promises
.


These
protests
are
sometimes
named
``
Maple
Spring
''
,
from
the
which
alludes
to
(
Arab
spring
)
as
well
as
the
maple
tree
which
symbolizes
Quebec
and
Canada
.


The
Falls
of
Cruachan
derailment
occurred
on
6
June
2010
on
the
West
Highland
Line
in
Scotland
,
when
a
passenger
train
travelling
between
Glasgow
and

hit
boulders
on

derailed
near

of
Cruachan
railway

,
after
a
landslide
.


There
was
a
small
fire
(
which
was
soon
put
out
with
fire
extinguishers
)
and
one
carriage
was
left
in
a
precarious
position
on
the
high
embankment
.


Sixty
passengers
were
evacuated
,
some
with
minor
injuries
;
eight
of
those
were
hospitalised
as
a
precaution
.


However
,
no
people
were
killed
.


In
addition
to
blocking
the
line
,
the
incident
also
caused
the
closure
of
the
A85
road
below
the
rail
line
.


Both
road
and
rail
were
closed
for
a
week
.


The
Sydney
Marathon
is
a
marathon
held
annually
in
Sydney
,
Australia
each
September
.


The
event
was
first
held
in
1999
as
a
test
event
for
the
Sydney
2000
Olympic
Games
,
as
has
continued
every
year
since
,
as
a
legacy
of
the
2000
Summer
Olympics
.


In
addition
to
the
marathon
,
a
half
marathon
,
``
Bridge
Run
''
,
and
a
``
Family
Fun
Run
''
are
also
held
under
the
banner
of
the
Sydney
Running
Festival
.


The
marathon
course
record
is
held
by
Gebo
Burka
of
Ethiopia
,
who
completed
the
race
in
2
hours
,
11
minutes
and
18
seconds
in
2014
.


The
fastest
woman
is
the
former
Ethiopian
Makda
Harun
,
now
an
Australian
resident
,
who
ran
a
time
of
2
hours
,
28
minutes
and
6
seconds
in
2017
.


Introduced
in
2001
,
the
Sydney
Marathon
followed
the
same
course
as
the
marathon
during
the
2000
Summer
Olympics
the
previous
year
.


During
that
first
year
,
the
women
's
race
was
won
by
Krishna
Stanton
,
who
had
never
run
a
marathon
before
,
and
was
doing
the
event
as
a
result
of
a
challenge
from
a
friend
.


The
Bridge
Run
was
added
in
2002
,
initially
as
a
10
km
event
,
before
being
reduced
to
9
km
in
2005
.


The
Bridge
Run
has
since
returned
to
being
an
AIMS
certified
10
km
distance
.


the
marathon
and
half
marathon
both
finish
at
the
sydney
opera
house
,
while
the
shorter
runs
end
at
the
royal
botanic
gardens
.


In
2010
the
marathon
course
was
changed
to
flatten
it
out
which
,
according
to
the
organisers
,
makes
it
``
a
faster
,
more
scenic
and
spectator
friendly
course
.
''


In
2014
the
marathon
was
awarded
a
Silver
Label
Road
Race
by
the
International
Association
of
Athletics
Federations
(
IAAF
)
,
then
in
December
2014
the
race
was
awarded
a
Gold
Label
Road
Race
in
time
for
the
2015
race
.


As
of
2014
,
nine
runners
have
competed
in
every
Sydney
Marathon
,
and
have
been
dubbed
``
Blue
Line
Legends
''
.


The
Jacobite
rising
of
1745
,
also
known
as
the
Forty-five
Rebellion
or
simply
the
'45
(
,
``
The
Year
of
Charles
''
)
,
was
an
attempt
by
Charles
Edward
Stuart
to
regain
the
British
throne
for
his
father
,
James
Francis
Edward
Stuart
.


It
took
place
during
the
War
of
the
Austrian
Succession
,
when
the
bulk
of
the
British
Army
was
fighting
in
mainland
Europe
,
and
proved
to
be
the
last
in
a
series
of
revolts
that
began
in
1689
,
with
major
outbreaks
in
1708
,
1715
and
1719
.


Charles
launched
the
rebellion
on
19
August
1745
at
Glenfinnan
in
the
Scottish
Highlands
,
capturing
Edinburgh
and
winning
the
Battle
of
Prestonpans
in
September
.


At
a
council
in
October
,
the
Scots
agreed
to
invade
England
after
Charles
assured
them
of
substantial
support
from
English
Jacobites
and
a
simultaneous
French
landing
in
Southern
England
.


On
that
basis
,
the
Jacobite
army
entered
England
in
early
November
,
reaching
Derby
on
4
December
,
where
they
decided
to
turn
back
.


Similar
discussions
had
taken
place
at
Carlisle
,
Preston
and
Manchester
and
many
felt
they
had
gone
too
far
already
.


The
invasion
route
had
been
selected
to
cross
areas
considered
strongly
Jacobite
but
the
promised
English
support
failed
to
materialise
;
they
were
now
outnumbered
and
in
danger
of
having
their
retreat
cut
off
.


The
decision
was
supported
by
the
vast
majority
but
caused
an
irretrievable
split
between
Charles
and
his
Scots
supporters
.


Despite
victory
at
Falkirk
Muir
in
January
1746
,
the
Battle
of
Culloden
in
April
ended
the
Rebellion
and
significant
backing
for
the
Stuart
cause
.


Charles
escaped
to
France
,
but
was
unable
to
win
support
for
another
attempt
,
and
died
in
Rome
in
1788
.


Typhoon
Mamie
was
the
worst
tropical
cyclone
to
affect
northeastern
China
in
26
years
.


Originating
from
an
area
of
disturbed
weather
near
the
Philippines
in
mid-August
1985
,
the
system
gradually
became
better
organized
,
and
was
upgraded
into
a
tropical
storm
early
on
August
16
.


It
continued
to
deepen
,
and
late
on
August
17
,
Mamie
attained
typhoon
intensity
.


Around
this
time
,
Typhoon
Mamie
reached
its
peak
intensity
of
,
which
it
maintained
for
12
hours
.


After
making
landfall
in
Shanghai
,
the
storm
steadily
weakened
.


However
,
after
turning
north
and
crossing
the
Shanghai
Peninsula
and
the
Yellow
Sea
,
Mamie
made
a
second
landfall
near
Yantai
as
a
tropical
storm
.


After
turning
northwest
and
re-entering
the
Yellow
Sea
,
Mamie
moved
ashore
for
the
third
and
final
time
near
Dairen
.


On
August
21
,
Mamie
dissipated
inland
over
northeastern
China
.


Due
to
both
Mamie
and
Nelson
,
widespread
flooding
was
reported
across
much
of
northern
China
,
with
19
rivers
overflowing
.


The
typhoon
forced
around
1,000
factories
to
temporarily
close
,
and
toppled
approximately
6.5
million
trees
.


Moreover
,
about
8,000
homes
were
flooded
and
120,000
houses
received
damage
Nearly
1
million
people
were
directly
affected
by
the
typhoon
.


The
typhoon
killed
more
than
120,000
animals
and
sank
more
than
200
boats
.


Overall
,
17
fatalities
occurred
and
165
were
injured
.


Losses
totaled
$
172
million
(
1985
USD
)
.


The
2012–13
Iraqi
protests
started
on
21
December
2012
following
a
raid
on
the
home
of
Sunni
Finance
Minister
Rafi
al-Issawi
and
the
arrest
of
10
of
his
bodyguards
.


Beginning
in
Fallujah
,
the
protests
afterwards
spread
throughout
Sunni
Arab
parts
of
Iraq
.


The
protests
centered
on
the
issue
of
the
alleged
sectarianism
of
Prime
Minister
Nouri
al-Maliki
.


Pro-Maliki
protests
also
took
place
throughout
central
and
southern
Iraq
,
where
there
is
a
Shia
Arab
majority
.


In
April
2013
,
sectarian
violence
escalated
after
the
2013
Hawija
clashes
.


The
protests
continued
throughout
2013
,
and
in
December
Maliki
used
security
forces
to
forcefully
close
down
the
main
protest
camp
,
in
Ramadi
and
killing
hundreds
of
civilian
protesters
in
the
process
.


Sunni
groups
,
such
as
the
Army
of
the
Men
of
the
Naqshbandi
Order
,
took
up
arms
in
response
,
and
joined
forces
with
the
General
Military
Council
for
Iraqi
Revolutionaries
(
GMCIR
)
,
a
militant
group
made
up
of
former
Ba'athists
,
to
conduct
a
military
campaign
against
the
Iraqi
government
.


The
Islamic
State
of
Iraq
and
the
Levant
(
ISIL
)
would
later
grow
out
of
this
civil
conflict
.


The
2012
UCI
Road
World
Championships
took
place
in
the
southern
part
of
the
Dutch
province
of
Limburg
,
also
known
as
South
Limburg
,
between
September
15
and
23
.


The
event
consisted
of
a
road
race
and
a
time
trial
for
men
,
women
and
men
under
23
,
and
team
time
trials
for
elite
men
and
women
.


It
will
be
the
79th
Road
World
Championships
.


Castelfidardo
near
Loreto
in
Italy
was
also
a
candidate
,
but
Italy
had
held
the
UCI
Road
World
Championships
in
Varese
in
2008
.


The
Netherlands
last
hosted
the
Road
World
Championships
in
1998
in
Valkenburg
aan
de
Geul
and
this
time
it
was
the
seventh
time
in
total
that
the
country
has
hosted
the
championships
.


The
2012
championships
had
a
number
of
changes
compared
to
the
former
editions
.


A
team
time
trial
is
set
to
be
reintroduced
.


This
was
last
competed
as
a
world
championship
event
in
1994
between
nations
.


The
reintroduction
will
see
trade
teams
compete
,
similar
to
the
Eindhoven
Team
Time
Trial
held
between
2005
and
2007
.


The
Junior
championships
will
also
be
on
the
programme
.


With
the
extra
events
,
the
championships
will
be
held
over
two
weekends
(
nine
days
)
and
will
also
include
an
opening
ceremony
and
a
cyclosportive
event
.


Start/Finish
for
the
events
is
in
Vilt
,
a
commune
of
Valkenburg
aan

The
Dreamchaser
World
Tour
was
the
fifth
worldwide
concert
tour
by
English
soprano
singer
Sarah
Brightman
in
support
of
her
album
``
Dreamchaser
''
(
2013
)
.


The
North
American
tour
had
been
planned
to
begin
in
early
2013
,
but
all
dates
were
rescheduled
for
late
2013
.


The
tour
was
supposed
to
be
Brightman
's
final
concert
tour
before
her
trip
into
space
(
which
the
``
Dreamchaser
''
album
is
based
on
)
but
the
trip
was
later
cancelled
due
to
personal
reasons
.


The
2013
North
American
leg
of
Brightman
's
``
Dreamchaser
''
tour
consisted
of
her
performing
86
shows
over
a
seven-month
time
span
.


It
has
been
her
longest
tour
since
the
Harem
World
Tour
in
2004
,
and
it
was
also
her
worldwide
tour
with
more
dates
in
Asia
and
South
America
.


Brightman
also
added
dates
in
countries
where
she
had
never
performed
before
,
such
as
United
Arab
Emirates
and
Qatar
.


In
April
2014
,
a
second
leg
of
the
North
American
tour
was
announced
for
the
summer
season
;
however
,
on
18
June
2014
,
Brightman
cancelled
the
summer
dates
after
sustaining
an
ankle
injury
.


The
remainder
of
the
tour
ultimately
resumed
in
November
2014
,
coming
to
an
end
a
month
later
.


The
Battle
of
San
Romano
was
fought
on
June
1
,
1432
,
in
San
Romano
,
some
30
miles
outside
Florence
,
between
the
troops
of
Florence
,
commanded
by
Niccolò
da
Tolentino
,
and
Siena
,
under
Francesco
Piccinino
.


The
outcome
is
generally
considered
favourable
to
the
Florentines
,
but
in
the
Sienese
chronicles
it
was
considered
a
victory
.


As
the
1430s
began
Florence
had
found
itself
in
conflict
with
the
rival
city
state
of
Lucca
,
and
her
allies
,
Siena
and
Milan
.


The
Florentine
deployed
about
4,000
horse
and
2,000
infantry
.


The
clash
,
which
lasted
for
some
six
or
seven
hours
,
consisted
of
a
series
of
heavy
cavalry
fights
.


It
was
decided
by
the
intervention
of
a
second
cavalry
corps
commanded
by
Micheletto
Attendolo
.


The
Rhythm
Nation
World
Tour
1990
was
the
first
headlining
concert
tour
by
American
recording
artist
Janet
Jackson
.


it
was
launched
in
support
of
her
fourth
studio
album
``
janet
jackson
's
rhythm
nation
1814
''
(
1989
)
,
and
also
contained
material
from
her
third
studio
album
``
control
''
(
1986
)
.


Jackson
's
record
label
A
&
M
announced
plans
for
the
world
tour
in
fall
1989
,
following
the
release
of
``
Rhythm
Nation
1814
''
.


Managed
by
Roger
Davies
and
Rusty
Hooker
,
the
tour
was
developed
by
musical
director
Chuckii
Booker
,
choreographer
Anthony
Thomas
,
stage
designer
Roy
Bennett
,
stage
manager
Chris
Tervit
,
production
manager
Benny
Collins
,
and
Jackson
herself
.


The
nine-month
trek
saw
concerts
in
the
United
States
,
Canada
,
Japan
,
the
Netherlands
,
Germany
,
France
,
and
the
United
Kingdom
.


It
began
in
the
United
States
in
March
1990
and
continued
through
November
1990
,
when
it
came
to
a
close
with
a
return
trip
to
Japan
.


songs
performed
during
the
set
list
of
the
tour
were
divided
evenly
between
jackson
's
third
and
fourth
studio
unk
concert
began
with
``
control
''
(
1986
)
and
ended
with
``
rhythm
nation
''
(
1989
)
.


Noting
performances
placed
greater
emphasis
on
theatricality
over
vocal
prowess
,
the
tour
received
numerous
stellar
reviews
based
on
Jackson
's
showmanship
,
choreography
,
and
socially
conscious
message
,
drawing
some
comparison
to
pop
icons
Prince
and
her
brother
Michael
Jackson
.


The
tour
was
a
commercial
success
,
grossing
over
$
28.1
million
in
North
America
alone
.


``
This
is
a
sub-article
to
Leningrad–Novgorod
Offensive
and
Battle
of
Narva
.
''


The
Kingisepp–Gdov
Offensive
was
a
campaign
between
the
Soviet
Leningrad
Front
and
the
German
18th
Army
fought
for
the
eastern
coast
of
Lake
Peipus
and
the
western
banks
of
the
Narva
River
from
1
February
till
1
March
1944
.


The
109th
Rifle
Corps
captured
the
town
of
Kingisepp
,
forcing
the
18th
Army
into
new
positions
on
the
eastern
bank
of
the
Narva
.


Forward
units
of
the
2nd
Shock
Army
crossed
the
river
and
established
several
bridgeheads
on
the
west
bank
,
to
the
north
and
south
of
the
town
of
Narva
on
2
February
.


The
8th
Army
expanded
the
bridgehead
in
Krivasoo
Swamp
south
of
the
town
five
days
later
,
cutting
the
railway
behind
the
Sponheimer
Group
.


Army
General
Leonid
Govorov
was
unable
to
take
advantage
of
the
opportunity
of
encircling
the
smaller
German
detachment
which
called
in
reinforcements
.


These
came
mostly
from
the
newly
mobilised
Estonians
motivated
to
resist
the
looming
Soviet
re-occupation
.


at
the
same
time
,
the
soviet
108th
rifle
corps
landed
its
units
across
lake
peipus
in
unk
island
120
kilometres
south
of
narva
and
established
a
bridgehead
in

By
coincidence
,
the
I.Battalion
,
``
Waffen-Grenadier
Regiment
der
SS
''
45
(
1st
Estonian
)
headed
for
Narva
reached

a
battalion
of
the
44th
Infantry
Regiment
(
consisting
in
personnel
from
East
Prussia
)
,
and
an
air
squadron
destroyed
the
Soviet
bridgehead
on
15–16
February
.


A
simultaneous
Soviet
amphibious
assault
was
conducted
,
as
the
517
strong
260th
Independent
Naval
Infantry
Brigade
landed
at
the
coastal
borough
of
Mereküla
behind
the
Sponheimer
Group
lines
.


However
,
the
unit
was
almost
completely
annihilated
.

As
the
result
of
the
campaign
,
the
Soviet
forces
seized
control
of
most
of
the
eastern
coast
of
Lake
Peipus
and
established
a
number
of
bridgeheads
on
the
western

Front
was
the
main
theatre
of
war
during
the
First
World
War
.


Following
the
outbreak
of
war
in
August
1914
,
the
German
Army
opened
the
Western
Front
by
invading
Luxembourg
and
Belgium
,
then
gaining
military
control
of
important
industrial
regions
in
France
.


The
tide
of
the
advance
was
dramatically
turned
with
the
Battle
of
the
Marne
.


Following
the
Race
to
the
Sea
,
both
sides
dug
in
along
a
meandering
line
of
fortified
trenches
,
stretching
from
the
North
Sea
to
the
Swiss
frontier
with
France
,
which
changed
little
except
during
early
1917
and
in
1918
.


Between
1915
and
1917
there
were
several
offensives
along
this
front
.


The
attacks
employed
massive
artillery
bombardments
and
massed
infantry
advances
.


Entrenchments
,
machine
gun
emplacements
,
barbed
wire
and
artillery
repeatedly
inflicted
severe
casualties
during
attacks
and
counter-attacks
and
no
significant
advances
were
made
.


Among
the
most
costly
of
these
offensives
were
the
Battle
of
Verdun
,
in
1916
,
with
a
combined
700,000
casualties
(
estimated
)
,
the
Battle
of
the
Somme
,
also
in
1916
,
with
more
than
a
million
casualties
(
estimated
)
,
and
the
Battle
of
Passchendaele
(
Third
Battle
of
Ypres
)
,
in
1917
,
with
487,000
casualties
(
estimated
)
.


To
break
the
deadlock
of
trench
warfare
on
the
Western
Front
,
both
sides
tried
new
military
technology
,
including
poison
gas
,
aircraft
,
and
tanks
.


The
adoption
of
better
tactics
and
the
cumulative
weakening
of
the
armies
in
the
west
led
to
the
return
of
mobility
in
1918
.


the
german
spring
offensive
of
1918
was
made
possible
by
the
treaty
of
brest-litovsk
that
ended
the
war
of
the
central
powers
against
russia
and
romania
on
the
eastern
front
.


Using
short
,
intense
``
hurricane
''
bombardments
and
infiltration
tactics
,
the
German
armies
moved
nearly
to
the
west
,
the
deepest
advance
by
either
side
since
1914
,
but
the
result
was
indecisive
.


The
unstoppable
advance
of
the
Allied
armies
during
the
Hundred
Days
Offensive
of
1918
caused
a
sudden
collapse
of
the
German
armies
and
persuaded
the
German
commanders
that
defeat
was
inevitable
.


the
german
government
surrendered
in
the
armistice
of
11
november
1918
,
and
the
terms
of
peace
were
settled
by
the
treaty
of
versailles
in
1919
.


The
April
2015
Nepal
earthquake
(
also
known
as
the
Gorkha
earthquake
)
killed
nearly
9,000
people
and
injured
nearly
22,000
.

a
magnitude
of
7.8M
or
8.1M
and
a
maximum
Mercalli
Intensity
of
VIII
(
``
Severe
''
)
.


Its
epicenter
was
east
of
Gorkha
District
at
Barpak
,
Gorkha
,
and
its
hypocenter
was
at
a
depth
of
approximately
.


It
was
the
worst
natural
disaster
to
strike
Nepal
since
the
1934
Nepal–Bihar
earthquake
.


The
ground
motion
recorded
in
the
capital
of
Nepal
was
of
low
frequency
,
which
,
along
with
its
occurrence
at
an
hour
where
many
people
in
rural
areas
were
working
outdoors
,
decreased
the
loss
of
property
and
human
lives
.


the
earthquake
triggered
an
avalanche
on
mount
everest
,
killing
21
,
making
25
april
2015
the
deadliest
day
on
the
mountain
in
history
.


The
earthquake
triggered
another
huge
avalanche
in
the
Langtang
valley
,
where
250
people
were
reported
missing
.


Hundreds
of
thousands
of
Nepalese
were
made
homeless
with
entire
villages
flattened
,
across
many
districts
of
the
country
.


Centuries-old
buildings
were
destroyed
at
UNESCO
World

in
the
Kathmandu
Valley
,
including
some
at

the
Bhaktapur
Durbar
Square
,
the
Changu
Narayan
Temple
,
the
Boudhanath
stupa
and
the
Swayambhunath
Stupa
.


Geophysicists
and
other
experts
had
warned
for
decades
that
Nepal
was
vulnerable
to
a
deadly
earthquake
,
particularly
because
of
its
geology
,
urbanization
,
and
architecture
.


Dharahara
,
also
called
Bhimsen
Tower
,
which
was
a
nine-storey
and
61.88-metre-tall
tower
was
destroyed
.


It
was
a
part
of
the
architecture
of
Kathmandu
recognized
by
UNESCO
.


Continued
aftershocks
occurred
throughout
Nepal
at

.


More
than
200

On
24
July
2010
,
a
crowd
disaster
at
the
2010
Love
Parade
electronic
dance
music
festival
in
Duisburg
,
North
Rhine-Westphalia
,
Germany
,
caused
the
death
of
21
people
from
suffocation
.


at
least
500
more
were
injured
.


The
Love
Parade
was
a
free-access
music
festival
and
parade
that
originated
in
1989
in
Berlin
.


The
parade
featured
stages
,
but
also
had
floats
with
music
,
DJs
and
dancers
moving
through
the
audience
.


The
Love
Parade
in
Duisburg
was
the
first
time
that
the
festival
had
been
held
in
a
closed-off
area
.


Between
200,000
and
people
were
reported
to
be
attending
the
event
and
3,200
police
were
on
hand
.


As
a
consequence
of
the
disaster
,
the
organizer
of
the
festival
announced
that
no
further
Love
Parades
would
be
held
and
that
the
festival
was
permanently
cancelled
.


Criminal
charges
were
brought
against
ten
employees
of
the
city
of
Duisburg
and
of
the
company
that
organized
the
event
,
but
eventually
rejected
by
the
court
due
to
the
prosecutors
'
failure
to
establish
evidence
for
the
alleged
acts
of
negligence
and
their
causal
connection
to
the
deaths
.


On
18
April
2017
the
State
Supreme
Court
Dusseldorf
stated
that
it
would
be
reopening
court
proceedings
for
prosecution
of
10
people
involved
in
planning
the
event
,
accusing
them
of
negligent
homicide
and
mayhem
.


The
first
hearing
of
the
trial
was
held
on
8
December
2017
.


The
Lincoln
rail
crash
occurred
on
3
June
1962
,
when
the
22:15
sleeping
car
express
train
from
King
's
Cross
to
Edinburgh
derailed
on
a
sharp
curve
at
Lincoln
Central
railway
station
.


Two
passengers
and
a
sleeping
car
attendant
were
killed
and
7
people
were
seriously
injured
.


The
train
had
been
diverted
from
its
usual
route
because
of
engineering
work
on
the
East
Coast
Main
Line
.


A
conductor
driver
had
taken
the
controls
of
the
locomotive
,
an
English
Electric
Type
4
,
because
the
regular
driver
did
not
know
the
diversionary
route
.


The
conductor
driver
was
not
qualified
to
drive
diesel
locomotives
,
but
he
had
done
so
occasionally
before
.


It
was
thought
that
he
was
used
to
driving
without
a
speedometer
and
so
had
misjudged
his
speed
on
the
approach
to
Lincoln
,
entering
a
15
mph
curve
at
around
55
mph
.


The
driver
had
also
evidently
been
inattentive
because
the
home
signal
near
the
curve
was
not
cleared
until
the
train
was
almost
at
it
,
yet
it
passed
the
signal
at
around
60
mph
.


Most
of
the
coaches
were
derailed
although
the
locomotive
was
not
;
the
latter
coming
to
a
stand
in
the
middle
of
Lincoln
Central
station
.

The
Qatar
2022
FIFA

bid
was
a

by
Qatar
to
host

2022
FIFA
World
Cup
.


With
a
population
of
2
million
people
,
Qatar
will
be
the
first
Arab
state
to
host
the
World
Cup
.


Sheikh
Mohammed
bin
Hamad
bin
Khalifa
Al-Thani
,
son
of
Hamad
bin
Khalifa
Al
Thani
the
then
Emir
of
Qatar
,
was
the
chairman
of
the
bid
committee
.


Qatar
promoted
their
hosting
of
the
tournament
as
representing
the
Arab
World
,
and
has
drawn
support
from
across
the
member
states
of
the
Arab
League
.


They
also
positioned
their
bid
as
an
opportunity
to
bridge
the
gap
between
the
Arab
World
and
the
West
.


On
17
November
2010
,
Qatar
hosted
a
friendly
match
between
Brazil
and
Argentina
.


This
was
one
of
47
international
exhibition
games
held
throughout
the
world
on
this
day
.


President
of
FIFA
Sepp
Blatter
endorsed
the
idea
of
having
a
World
Cup
in
the
Arab
World
,
saying
in
April
2010
:
``
The
Arabic
world
deserves
a
World
Cup
.


They
have
22
countries
and
have
not
had
any
opportunity
to
organize
the
tournament
''
.


Blatter
also
praised
Qatar
's
progress
:
``
When
I
was
first
in
Qatar
there
were
400,000
people
here
and
now
there
are
1.6
million
.


In
terms
of
infrastructure
,
when
you
are
able
to
organise
the
Asian
Games
(
in
2006
)
with
more
than
30
events
for
men
and
women
,
then
that
is
not
in
question
''
.


On
2
December

it
was
announced
that

will
host
the
2022
FIFA
World
Cup
.


The
Second
Battle
of
Bull
Run
or
Battle
of
Second
Manassas
was
fought
August
28–30
,
1862
in
Prince
William
County
,
Virginia
,
as
part
of
the
American
Civil
War
.


It
was
the
culmination
of
the
Northern
Virginia
Campaign
waged
by
Confederate
Gen.
Robert
E.
Lee
's
Army
of
Northern
Virginia
against
Union
Maj.
Gen.
John
Pope
's
Army
of
Virginia
,
and
a
battle
of
much
larger
scale
and
numbers
than
the
First
Battle
of
Bull
Run
(
or
``
First
Manassas
''
)
fought
on
July
21
,
1861
on
the
same
ground
.


Following
a
wide-ranging
flanking
march
,
Confederate
Maj.
Gen.
Thomas
J
.


``
Stonewall
''
Jackson
captured
the
Union
supply
depot
at
Manassas
Junction
,
threatening
Pope
's
line
of
communications
with
Washington
,
D.C
.


Withdrawing
a
few
miles
to
the
northwest
,
Jackson
took
up
strong
concealed
defensive
positions
on
Stony
Ridge
and
awaited
the
arrival
of
the
wing
of
Lee
's
army
commanded
by
Maj.
Gen.
James
Longstreet
.


On
August
28
,
1862
,
Jackson
attacked
a
Union
column
just
east
of
Gainesville
,
at
Brawner
's
Farm
,
resulting
in
a
stalemate
but
successfully
getting
Pope
's
attention
.


On
that
same
day
,
Longstreet
broke
through
light
Union
resistance
in
the
Battle
of
Thoroughfare
Gap
and
approached
the
battlefield
.


Pope
became
convinced
that
he
had
trapped
Jackson
and
concentrated
the
bulk
of
his
army
against
him
.


On
August
29
,
Pope
launched
a
series
of
assaults
against
Jackson
's
position
along
an
unfinished
railroad
grade
.


The
attacks
were
repulsed
with
heavy
casualties
on
both
sides
.


at
noon
,
longstreet
arrived
on
the
field
from
thoroughfare
gap
and
took
position
on
jackson
's
right
flank
.


On
August
30
,
Pope
renewed
his
attacks
,
seemingly
unaware
that
Longstreet
was
on
the
field
.


When
massed
Confederate
artillery
devastated
a
Union
assault
by
Maj.
Gen.
Fitz
John
Porter
's
V
Corps
,
Longstreet
's
wing
of
25,000
men
in
five
divisions
counterattacked
in
the
largest
simultaneous
mass
assault
of
the
war
.


The
Union
left
flank
was
crushed
and
the
army
was
driven
back
to
Bull
Run
.


Only
an
effective
Union
rear
guard
action
prevented
a
replay
of
the
First
Manassas
defeat
.


Pope
's
retreat
to
Centreville
was
nonetheless
precipitous
.


Success
in
this
battle
emboldened
Lee
to
initiate
the
ensuing
Maryland
Campaign
.

The
Gothic
Line
(
;
)
was
a
German
defensive
line
of
the
Italian
Campaign
of
World
War
II
.


It
formed
Field
Marshal
Albert
Kesselring
's
last
major
line
of
defence
along
the
summits
of
the
northern
part
of
the
Apennine
Mountains
during
the
fighting
retreat
of
the
German
forces
in
Italy
against
the
Allied
Armies
in
Italy
,
commanded
by
General
Sir
Harold
Alexander
.


Adolf
Hitler
had
concerns
about
the
state
of
preparation
of
the
Gothic
Line
:
he
feared
the
Allies
would
use
amphibious
landings
to
outflank
its
defences
.


To
downgrade
its
importance
in
the
eyes
of
both
friend
and
foe
,
he
ordered
the
name
,
with
its
historic
connotations
,
changed
,
reasoning
that
if
the
Allies
managed
to
break
through
they
would
not
be
able
to
use
the
more
impressive
name
to
magnify
their
victory
claims
.


In
response
to
this
order
,
Kesselring
renamed
it
the
``
Green
Line
''
(
``
Grüne
Linie
''
)
in
June
1944
.


Using
more
than
15,000
slave
labourers
,
the
Germans
created
more
than
2,000
well-fortified
machine
gun
nests
,
casemates
,
bunkers
,
observation
posts
and
artillery
fighting
positions
to
repel
any
attempt
to
breach
the
Gothic
Line
.


Initially
this
line
was
breached
during
Operation
``
Olive
''
(
also
sometimes
known
as
the
Battle
of
Rimini
)
,
but
Kesselring
's
forces
were
consistently
able
to
retire
in
good
order
.


This
continued
to
be
the
case
up
to
March
1945
,
with
the
Gothic
Line
being
breached
but
with
no
decisive
breakthrough
;
this
would
not
take
place
until
April
1945
during
the
final
Allied
offensive
of
the
Italian
Campaign
.


Operation
Olive
has
been
described
as
the
biggest
battle
of
materials
ever
fought
in
Italy
.


over
1,200,000
men
participated
in
the
battle
.


The
battle
took
the
form
of
a
pincer
manoeuvre
,
carried
out
by
the
British
Eighth
Army
and
the
U.S.
Fifth
Army
against
the
German
10th
Army
(
10
.


``
Armee
''
)
and
German
14th
Army
(
14
.


``
Armee
''
)
.


Rimini
,
a
city
which
had
been
hit
by
previous
air
raids
,
had
1,470,000
rounds
fired
against
it
by
allied
land
forces
.


According
to
Lieutenant-General
Oliver
Leese
,
commander
of
the
British
Eighth
Army
:


Operation
Cobra
was
the
codename
for
an
offensive
launched
by
the
First
United
States
Army
(
Lieutenant
General
Omar
Bradley
)
seven
weeks
after
the
D-Day
landings
,
during
the
Normandy
Campaign
of
World
War
II
.


The
intention
was
to
take
advantage
of
the
distraction
of
the
Germans
by
the
British
and
Canadian
attacks
around
Caen
,
in
Operation
Goodwood
and
break
through
the
German
defenses
that
were
penning
in
his
troops
,
while
the
Germans
were
unbalanced
.


Once
a
corridor
had
been
created
,
the
First
Army
would
then
be
able
to
advance
into
Brittany
,
rolling
up
the
German
flanks
once
free
of
the
constraints
of
the
bocage
country
.


After
a
slow
start
the
offensive
gathered
momentum
and
German
resistance
collapsed
as
scattered
remnants
of
broken
units
fought
to
escape
to
the
Seine
.


Lacking
the
resources
to
cope
with
the
situation
,
the
German
response
was
ineffectual
and
the
entire
Normandy
front
soon
collapsed
.


Operation
Cobra
,
together
with
concurrent
offensives
by
the
British
Second
Army
and
the
Canadian
First
Army
,
was
decisive
in
securing
an
Allied
victory
in
the
Normandy
Campaign
.


Having
been
delayed
several
times
by
poor
weather
,
Operation
Cobra
commenced
on
25
July
,
with
a
concentrated
aerial
bombardment
from
thousands
of
Allied
aircraft
.


Supporting
offensives
had
drawn
the
bulk
of
German
armored
reserves
toward
the
British
and
Canadian
sector
and
coupled
with
the
general
lack
of
men
and
materiel
available
to
the
Germans
,
it
was
impossible
for
them
to
form
successive
lines
of
defense
.


Units
of
the
U.S.
VII
Corps
led
the
initial
two-division
assault
,
while
other
First
U.S.
Army
corps
mounted
supporting
attacks
designed
to
pin
German
units
in
place
.


Progress
was
slow
on
the
first
day
but
opposition
started
to
crumble
once
the
defensive
crust
had
been
broken
.


By
27
July
,
most
organized
resistance
had
been
overcome
and
the
VII
and
VIII
Corps
advanced
rapidly
,
isolating
the
Cotentin
Peninsula
.


By
31
July
,
XIX
Corps
had
destroyed
the
last
forces
opposing
the
First
Army
,
which
emerged
from
the
bocage
.


Reinforcements
were
moved
west
by
Field
Marshal
Günther
von
Kluge
and
employed
in
various
counterattacks
,
the
largest
of
which
,
``
Unternehmen
Lüttich
''
(
Operation
Liège
)
,
was
launched
on
7
August
between
Mortain
and
Avranches
.


although
this
led
to
the
bloodiest
phase
of
the
battle
,
it
was
mounted
by
already
exhausted
and
understrength
units
and
was
a
costly
failure
.


On
8
August
,
troops
of
the
newly
activated
Third
United
States
Army
captured
the
city
of
Le
Mans
,
formerly
the
German
7th
Army
headquarters
.


Operation
Cobra
transformed
the
high-intensity
infantry
combat
of
Normandy
into
rapid
maneuver
warfare
and
led
to
the
creation
of
the
Falaise
pocket
and
the
loss
of
the
German
position
in
northwestern
France
.


The
2014
tour
by
American
alternative
rock
band
the
Breeders
comprised
thirteen
concerts
in
the
central
and
western
United
States
in
September
2014
.


The
group
's
lineup
for
their
1993
album
``
Last

''
consisted
of
Josephine
Wiggs
,
Jim
Macpherson
,
Kim
Deal
,
and
Kelley

.


Wiggs
and
Macpherson
were
not
members
for
the

next
albums
,
``
Title

''
(
2002
)
and
``

.


In
2013
,
the
1993
lineup
reunited
for
a
tour
to
commemorate
``
Last
Splash
''
s
20th
anniversary
,
and
the
following
year
began
working
on
new
material
together
.


Invited
to
open
for
Neutral
Milk
Hotel
's
September
18
concert
at
the
Hollywood
Bowl
,
they
planned
a
tour
to
lead
up
to
this
show
,
using
the
opportunity
to
practice
their
recent
compositions
.


Between
September
2
and

performed
in
eleven
cities
,
including
St.
Louis
,

,
respectively
.


the
group
then
played
at

,
and
finished
the
tour
on
september

at
the
goose
island
312
urban
block
party
event
in
chicago
.


As
well
as
their
new
songs
,
they
performed
numerous
selections
from
``
Last
Splash
''
and
``
Pod
''
(
1990
)
.


The
tour
received
good
reviews
from
critics
;
appraisal
included
comments
that
the
performances
were
rousing
,
and
that
the
band
was
as
good
as—or
better
than—in
its
heyday
.


Operation
Desert
Thunder
was
a
response
to
threats
by
Iraq
's
president
Saddam
Hussein
to
shoot
down
U-2
spy
planes
,
and
violate
the
no-fly
zone
set
up
over
his
country
.


The
operation
was
designed
to
bring
stability
to
the
region
by
bringing
in
a
military
presence
during
the
negotiations
between
Iraq
and
the
UN
over
weapons
of
mass
destruction
.


The
name
Operation
Desert
Thunder
has
been
applied
to
the
build-up
of
forces
in
the
Persian
Gulf
region
during
1998
.


If
an
actual
attack
had
been
ordered
and
executed
,
the
name
would
have
changed
to
Operation
Desert
Viper
.

Festival
.


It
happened
annually
in
Ballylinan
from

ran
for
a
second

The
First
Ivorian
Civil
War
was
a
conflict
in
the
Ivory
Coast
(
also
known
as
Côte
d'Ivoire
)
that
began
in
2002
.


although
most
of
the
fighting
ended
by
late
2004
,
the
country
remained
split
in
two
,
with
a
rebel-held
north
and
a
government-held
south
.


Hostility
increased
and
raids
on
foreign
troops
and
civilians
rose
.


,
the
region
was
tense
,
and
many
said
the
UN
and
the
French
military
failed
to
calm
the
civil
war
.


The
Ivory
Coast

football
team
was
credited
with
helping
to
secure
a
temporary
truce
when
it
qualified
for
the
2006
FIFA
World

and
brought
warring
parties
together

The
Second
Intifada
,
also
known
as
the
Al-Aqsa
Intifada
(
``
''
;
``
Intifādat
El-Aqtzah
''
)
,
was
a
period
of
intensified
Israeli–Palestinian
violence
,
which
Palestinians
describe
as
an
uprising
against
Israel
.


the
violence
started
in
september
2000
,
after
ariel
sharon
made
a
visit
to
the
temple
mount
,
seen
by
palestinians
as
highly
provocative
.


Palestinian
demonstrators
threw
stones
at
police
and
were
dispersed
by
the
Israeli
army
,
using
tear
gas
and
rubber
bullets
.


High
numbers
of
casualties
were
caused
among
civilians
as
well
as
combatants
.


The
Palestinians
engaged
in
numerous
suicide
bombings
,
rock
throwing
and
gunfire
,
while
the
Israelis
responded
with
gunfire
,
tank
and
air
attacks
,
and
numerous
targeted
killings
.


The
death
toll
,
including
both
military
and
civilian
,
is
estimated
to
be
about
3,000
Palestinians
and
1,000
Israelis
,
as
well
as
64
foreigners
.


Many
consider
the
Sharm
el-Sheikh
Summit
on
8
February
2005
to
be
the
end
of
the
Second
Intifada
.


Palestinian
President
Mahmoud
Abbas
and
Israeli
Prime
Minister
Ariel
Sharon
agreed
that
all
Palestinians
factions
would
stop
all
acts
of
violence
against
all
Israelis
everywhere
,
while
Israel
would
cease
all
its
military
activity
against
all
Palestinians
everywhere
.


They
also
reaffirmed
their
commitment
to
the
Roadmap
for
peace
process
.


Sharon
also
agreed
to
release
900
Palestinian
prisoners
of
the
7,500
being
held
at
the
time
,
and
to
withdraw
from
West
Bank
towns
.


However
,
the
violence
continued
into
the
following
years
,
though
suicide
bombings
decreased
significantly
.


The

The
Getå
Railroad
Disaster
(
)
was
a
train
disaster
caused
by
a
landslide
in
Getå
,
a
town
that
is
now
part
of
the
municipality
of
Norrköping
on
1
October
1918
.


To
date
,
it
is
the
worst
rail
accident
in
Swedish
history
.


The
derailment
occurred
when
the
layers
of
colloidal
clay
and
gravel
in
the
embankment
that
had
been
cut
into
the
hill
gave
way
.


Shortly
afterwards
,
a
mixed
train
consisting
of
a
locomotive
and
ten
cars
came
down
the
tracks
,
falling
down
the
embankment
and
landing
on
the
road
below
.


Of
the
passengers
and
crew
on
board
that
night
,
41
people
were
injured
and
at
least
42
were
killed
or
died
later
from
injuries
sustained
in
the
crash
.


It
is
unclear
how
many
died
in
the
derailment
compared
to
those
who
died
in
the
blaze
that
followed
it
.


Many
of
the
passengers
were
burned
alive
as
the
unreinforced
wooden
cars
caught
fire
,
killing
those
who
had
survived
the
crash
itself
but
were
still
trapped
in
the
wreckage
.


The
Muslim
conquest
of
Sicily
began
in
June
827
and
lasted
until
902
,
when
the
last
major
Byzantine
stronghold
on
the
island
,
Taormina
,
fell
.


Isolated
fortresses
remained
in
Byzantine
hands
until
965
,
but
the
island
was
henceforth
under
Muslim
rule
until
conquered
in
turn
by
the
Normans
in
the
11th
century
.


although
sicily
had
been
raided
by
the
muslims
since
the
mid-7th
century
,
these
raids
did
not
threaten
byzantine
control
over
the
island
,
which
remained
a
largely
peaceful
backwater
.


The
opportunity
for
the
Aghlabid
emirs
of
Ifriqiya
came
in
827
,
when
the
commander
of
the
island
's
fleet
,
Euphemius
,
rose
in
revolt
against
the
Byzantine
Emperor
Michael
II
.


Defeated
by
loyalist
forces
and
driven
from
the
island
,
Euphemius
sought
the
aid
of
the
Aghlabids
.


The
latter
regarded
this
as
an
opportunity
for
expansion
and
for
diverting
the
energies
of
their
own
fractious
military
establishment
and
alleviate
the
criticism
of
the
Islamic
scholars
by
championing
``
jihad
''
,
and
dispatched
an
army
to
aid
him
.


Following
the
Arab
landing
on
the
island
,
Euphemius
was
quickly
sidelined
.


An
initial
assault
on
the
island
's
capital
,
Syracuse
,
failed
,
but
the
Muslims
were
able
to
weather
the
subsequent
Byzantine
counter-attack
and
hold
on
to
a
few
fortresses
.


With
the
aid
of
reinforcements
from
Ifriqiya
and
al-Andalus
,
in
831
they
took
Palermo
,
which
became
the
capital
of
the
new
Muslim
province
.


The
Byzantine
government
sent
a
few
expeditions
to
aid
the
locals
against
the
Muslims
,
but
preoccupied
with
the
struggle
against
the
Abbasids
on
their
eastern
frontier
and
with
the
Cretan
Saracens
in
the
Aegean
Sea
,
it
was
unable
to
mount
a
sustained
effort
to
drive
back
the
Muslims
,
who
over
the
next
three
decades
raided
Byzantine
possessions
almost
unopposed
.


The
strong
fortress
of
Enna
in
the
centre
of
the
island
was
the
main
Byzantine
bulwark
against
Muslim
expansion
,
until
its
capture
in
859
.


Following
its
fall
,
the
Muslims
increased
their
pressure
against
the
eastern
parts
of
the
island
,
and
after
a
long
siege
captured
Syracuse
in
878
.


The
Byzantines
retained
control
of
some
fortresses
in
the
north-eastern
corner
of
the
island
for
some
decades
thereafter
,
and
launched
a
number
of
efforts
to
recover
the
island
until
well
into
the
11th
century
,
but
were
unable
to
seriously
challenge
Muslim
control
over
Sicily
.


The
fall
of
the
last
major
Byzantine
fortress
,
Taormina
,
in
902
,
is
held
to
mark
the
completion
of
the
Muslim
conquest
of
Sicily
.


Under
Muslim
rule
,
Sicily
prospered
and
eventually
detached
itself
from
Ifriqiya
to
form
a
semi-independent
emirate
.


The
island
's
Muslim
community
survived
the
Norman
conquest
in
the
1060s
and
even
prospered
under
the
Norman
kings
,
giving
birth
to
a
unique
cultural
mix
,
until
it
was
deported
to
Lucera
in
the
1220s
after
a
failed
uprising
.


on
the
evening
of
february
3
,
2015
,
a
commuter
train
on
metro-north
railroad
's
harlem
line
struck
a
passenger
car
at
a
grade
crossing
near
valhalla
,
new
york
,
united
states
,
between
the
valhalla
and
mount
pleasant
stations
,
killing
six
people
and
injuring
15
others
,
seven
very
seriously
.


The
crash
is
the
deadliest
in
Metro-North
's
history
,
as
well
as
at
the
time
the
deadliest
rail
accident
in
the
United
States
since
the
June
2009
Washington
Metro
train
collision
,
which
killed
eight
passengers
and
injured
80
.


The
crash
occurred
after
traffic
on
the
adjacent
Taconic
State
Parkway
had
been
detoured
onto
local
roads
following
a
car
accident
that
closed
the
road
in
one
direction
.


at
the
grade
crossing
,
a
sport
utility
vehicle
(
suv
)
driven
by
ellen
brody
of
nearby
edgemont
was
caught
between
the
crossing
gates
when
they
descended
onto
the
rear
of
her
car
as
the
train
approached
from
the
south
.


Instead
of
backing
into
the
space
another
driver
had
created
for
her
,
she
went
forward
onto
the
tracks
.


Brody
died
when
her
vehicle
was
struck
by
the
train
;
as
her
vehicle
was
pushed
along
the
tracks
it
loosened
more
than
of
third
rail
,
which
broke
into
sections
and
went
through
the
exterior
of
the
first
car
,
killing
five
passengers
and
starting
a
fire
.


Investigators
from
the
National
Transportation
Safety
Board
(
NTSB
)
focused
on
two
issues
in
the
accident
—
how
the
passengers
were
killed
,
since
that
rarely
occurs
in
grade
crossing
collisions
,
and
why
Brody
went
forward
into
the
train
's
path
.


After
an
unusually
long
delay
for
such
investigations
that
it
declined
to
explain
,
the
board
's
2017
final
report
found
no
defects
with
the
vehicles
,
the
crossing
signage
and
associated
traffic
signal
preemption
,
or
the
train
engineer
's
performance
.


It
found
that
the
failure
of
the
third
rail
to
break
into
smaller
segments
contributed
to
the
fatalities
on
the
train
,
but
could
not
explain
Brody
's
behavior
,
although
it
ruled
out
proffered
explanations
such
as
the
placement
of
her
car
's
gear
shift
lever
.


despite
the
report
's
findings
,
lawsuits
against
the
town
of
mount
pleasant
,
which
maintains
the
road
along
which
the
grade
crossing
is
located
,
westchester
county
,
the
railroad
and
the
engineer
are
proceeding
.


The
plaintiffs
all
allege
that
despite
the
NTSB
's
findings
,
those
parties
'
negligence
contributed
to
the
accident
.


Brody
's
family
contends
that
the
light
on
the
Taconic
was
red
for
most
of
the
time
she
was
waiting
on
the
grade
crossing
due
to
improper
programming
.


The
town
has
also
proposed
to
close
the
grade
crossing
,
per
findings
in
the
report
suggesting
that
it
was
inherently
unsafe
,
as
well
as
another
along
the
line
within
its
boundaries
;
however
,
residents
have
opposed
the
plan
.


Metro-North
's
parent
agency
,
the
Metropolitan
Transportation
Authority
(
MTA
)
,
also
launched
grade
crossing
safety
awareness
campaign
on
all
the
railways
it
operates
.

The
Sicilian
Expedition
was
an
Athenian
military
expedition
to
Sicily
,
which
took
place
415–413
BC
during
the
Peloponnesian
War
between
the
Athenian
empire
on
one
side
and
Sparta
,
Syracuse
and
Corinth
on
the
other
.


The
expedition
ended
in
a
devastating
defeat
of
the
Athenian
forces
.


The
expedition
was
hampered
from
the
outset
by
uncertainty
in
its
purpose
and
command
structure—political
maneuvering
in
Athens
swelled
a
lightweight
force
of
twenty
ships
into
a
massive
armada
,
and
the
expedition
's
primary
proponent
,
Alcibiades
,
was
recalled
from
command
to
stand
trial
before
the
fleet
even
reached
Sicily
.


Still
,
the
Athenians
achieved
early
successes
.


Syracuse
,
the
most
powerful
state
in
Sicily
,
responded
exceptionally
slowly
to
the
Athenian
threat
and
,
as
a
result
,
was
almost
completely
invested
before
the
arrival
of
back
up
in
the
form
of
Spartan
general
,
Gylippus
,
who
galvanized
its
inhabitants
into
action
.


From
that
point
forward
,
however
,
as
the
Athenians
ceded
the
initiative
to
their
newly
energized
opponents
,
the
tide
of
the
conflict
shifted
.


A
massive
reinforcing
armada
from
Athens
briefly
gave
the
Athenians
the
upper
hand
once
more
,
but
a
disastrous
failed
assault
on
a
strategic
high
point
and
several
crippling
naval
defeats
damaged
the
Athenian
soldiers
'
ability
to
continue
fighting
and
also
their
morale
.


The
Athenians
attempted
a
last-ditch
evacuation
from
Syracuse
.


The
evacuation
failed
,
and
nearly
the
entire
expedition
were
captured
or
were
destroyed
in
Sicily
.


The
effects
of
the
defeat
were
immense
.


Two
hundred
ships
and
thousands
of
soldiers
,
an
appreciable
portion
of
Athens
'
total
manpower
,
were
lost
in
a
single
stroke
.


The
city
's
enemies
on
the
mainland
and
in
Persia
were
encouraged
to
take
action
,
and
rebellions
broke
out
in
the
Aegean
.


Some
historians
consider
the
defeat
to
have
been
the
turning
point
in
the
war
,
though
Athens
continued
to
fight
for
another
decade
.


Thucydides
observed
that
contemporary
Greeks
were
shocked
not
that
Athens
eventually
fell
after
the
defeat
,
but
rather
that
it
fought
on
for
as
long
as
it
did
,
so
devastating
were
the
losses
suffered
.


Athens
managed
to
recover
remarkably
well
from
the
expedition
materially
,
with
the
principle
issue
being
the
loss
of
manpower
rather
than
the
loss
of
ships
.


the
xinhai
revolution
(
)
,
also
known
as
the
chinese
revolution
or
the
revolution
of
1911
,
was
a
revolution
that
overthrew
china
's
last
imperial
dynasty
(
the
qing
dynasty
)
and
established
the
republic
of
china
(
roc
)
.


The
revolution
was
named
Xinhai
(
Hsin-hai
)
because
it
occurred
in
1911
,
the
year
of
the
Xinhai
(
)
stem-branch
in
the
sexagenary
cycle
of
the
Chinese
calendar
.


The
revolution
consisted
of
many
revolts
and
uprisings
.


The
turning
point
was
the
Wuchang
uprising
on
10
October
1911
,
which
was
the
result
of
the
mishandling
of
the
Railway
Protection
Movement
.


The
revolution
ended
with
the
abdication
of
the
six-year-old
Last
Emperor
,
Puyi
,
on
12
February
1912
,
that
marked
the
end
of
2,000
years
of
imperial
rule
and
the
beginning
of
China
's
early
republican
era
.


The
revolution
arose
mainly
in
response
to
the
decline
of
the
Qing
state
,
which
had
proven
ineffective
in
its
efforts
to
modernize
China
and
confront
foreign
aggression
.


Many
underground
anti-Qing
groups
,
with
the
support
of
Chinese
revolutionaries
in
exile
,
tried
to
overthrow
the
Qing
.


The
brief
civil
war
that
ensued
was
ended
through
a
political
compromise
between
Yuan
Shikai
,
the
late
Qing
military
strongman
,
and
Sun
Yat-sen
,
the
leader
of
the
Tongmenghui
(
United
League
)
.

The
February
9–10
,
2010
North
American
blizzard
was
a
winter
and
severe
weather
event
that
afflicted
the
Midwest
,
Mid-Atlantic
and
New
England
regions
of
the
United
States
between
February
9–11
,
2010
,
affecting
some
of
the
same
regions
that
had
experienced
a
historic
Nor'easter
three
days
prior
.


The
storm
brought
of
snow
across
a
wide
swath
from
Washington
,
DC
to
New
York
City
,
with
parts
of
the
Baltimore
metro
area
receiving
more
than
.


This
storm
began
as
a
classic
``
Alberta
clipper
''
,
starting
out
in
Canada
and
then
moving
southeast
,
and
finally
curving
northeast
while
rapidly
intensifying
off
the
New
Jersey
coast
,
forming
an
eye
.


the
national
weather
service
,
in
an
interview
with
the
baltimore
sun
's
weather
reporter
frank
roylance
,
likened
this
storm
to
a
category
1
hurricane
.


Forecasters
told
Roylance
that
``
Winds
topped
58
mph
over
part
of
the
Chesapeake
Bay
,
and
40
mph
gusts
were
common
across
the
region
as
the
storm
's
center
deepened
and
drifted
slowly
along
the
mid-Atlantic
coast
''

This
storm
system
,
in

Cois
Fharraige
is
a
coastal
area
west
of
Galway
city
,
where
the
Irish
language
is
the
predominant
language
(
a
Gaeltacht
)
.


It
stretches
from
Na
Forbacha
,
Bearna
,
An
Spidéal
to
Indreabhán
.


There
are
between
8,000
and
9,000
people
living
in
this
area
.


The
area
is
most
often
included
within
the
definition
of
Connemara
,
but
some
say
that
Connemara
does
not
come
as
far
south
as
the
Galway
Bay
coast
.


The
Cois
Fharraige
accent
is
different
from
the
Conamara
Theas
(
south
Connemara
)
accent
-
Conamara
Theas
was
defined
at
a
time
when
Gaeltacht
Cois
Farraige
was
not
considered
part
of
Connemara
.


The
proportion
of
Irish
speakers
ranges
from
24
%
in
Bearna
to
84
%
in
Cill
Chuimín
.


The
headquarters
for
the
Gaeltacht
development
authority
Údarás
na
Gaeltachta
is
located
in
Na
Forbacha
.


Bearna
,
a
Gaeltacht
village
,
is
regarded
by
some
as
a
suburb
of
Galway
city
due
to
its
proximity
,
but
there
are
still
Irish
speakers
in
its
hinterland
,
and
it
still
retains
its
Gaeltacht
status
.


An

is
majority
Irish

the

was
against
the
unk
joint
comprehensive

of
action
,
which
was
perceived
to
give
iran
the
ability
to
gain
a
nuclear
weapon
.


Protestors
and
speakers
encouraged
the
United
States
Congress
to
vote
against
the
deal
.


since
most
republicans
in
congress
were
already
against
it
,
the
rally
focused
on
persuading
democratic
members
of
congress
,
especially
chuck
schumer
.


Members
of
both
parties
,
including
former
New
York
governor
George
Pataki
and

The
Battle
of
Stiklestad
(
,
Old
Norse
:
``
Stiklarstaðir
''
)
in
1030
is
one
of
the
most
famous
battles
in
the
history
of
Norway
.


In
this
battle
,
King
Olaf
II
of
Norway
(
Old
Norse
:
``
Óláfr
Haraldsson
''
)
was
killed
.


During
the
pontificate
of
Pope
Alexander
III
,
the
Roman
Catholic
Church
declared
Olaf
a
saint
in
1164
.


His
younger
half-brother
,
Harald
Hardrada
,
was
also
present
at
the
battle
.


Harald
was
only
fifteen
when
the
battle
of
Stiklestad
took
place
.


He
became
King
of
Norway
in
1047
,
until
his
death
in
a
failed
invasion
of
England
at
the
Battle
of
Stamford
Bridge
in
1066
.


The
authenticity
of
the
battle
as
a
historical
event
is
subject
to
question
.


Contemporary
sources
say
the
king
was
murdered
.


according
to
the
anglo
saxon
chronicle
of
1030
,
olaf
was
killed
by
his
own
people
.


Adam
of
Bremen
wrote
in
1070
that
Olaf
was
killed
in
an
ambush
,
and
so
did
Florence
of
Worcester
in
1100
.


Those
are
the
only
contemporary
sources
that
mention
the
death
of
the
king
.


After
the
king
's
canonization
it
was
felt
that
the
saint
could
not
have
died
in
such
circumstances
.


The
story
of
the
Battle
of
Stiklestad
as
we
know
it
gradually
developed
during
the
two
centuries
following
the
death
of
King
Olaf
.


Being
a
Saint
,
Olaf
must
have
fallen
in
a
major
battle
for
Christianity
.


The
Paris
massacre
of
1961
occurred
on
17
October
1961
,
during
the
Algerian
War
(
1954–62
)
.


Under
orders
from
the
head
of
the
Parisian
police
,
Maurice
Papon
,
the
French
National
Police
attacked
a
demonstration
of
some
30,000
pro-National
Liberation
Front
(
FLN
)
Algerians
.


After
37
years
of
denial
and
censorship
of
the
press
,
in
1998
the
French
government
finally
acknowledged
40
deaths
,
although
there
are
estimates
of
100
to
300
victims
.


Death
was
due
to
heavy-handed
beating
by
the
police
,
as
well
as
massive
drownings
,
as
police
officers
threw
demonstrators
in
the
river
Seine
.


The
massacre
appears
to
have
been
intentional
,
as
has
been
substantiated
by
historian
,
who
won
a
trial
against
Maurice
Papon
in
1999
(
Papon
had
been
convicted
in
1998
on
charges
of
crimes
against
humanity
for
his
role
under
the
Vichy
collaborationist
regime
during
World
War
II
)
.


Official
documentation
and
accounts
of
eyewitnesses
within
the
Paris
police
department
suggest
that
the
1961
massacre
was
directed
by
Papon
himself
.


Police
records
show
that
Papon
called
for
officers
in
one
station
to
be
``
subversive
''
in
quelling
the
demonstrations
,
and
assured
them
protection
from
prosecution
if
they
participated
.


Forty
years
after
the
massacre
,
on
17
October
2001
,
Bertrand
Delanoë
,
the
Socialist
Mayor
of
Paris
,
put
up
a
plaque
in
remembrance
of
the
massacre
on
the
Pont
Saint-Michel
.


How
many
demonstrators
were
killed
is
still
unclear
.


In
the
absence
of
official
estimates
,
the
placard
which
commemorates
the
massacre
stated
:
``
In
memory
of
the
many
Algerians
killed
during
the
bloody
repression
of
the
peaceful
demonstration
of
17
October
1961
''
.


On
18
February
2007
(
the
day
after
Papon
's
death
)
calls
were
made
for
a
Paris
Métro
station
under
construction
in
Gennevilliers
to
be
named
``
17
Octobre
1961
''
in
commemoration
of
the
massacre
.


The
events
were
documented
by
a
number
of
photographs
,
many
of
them
graphic
.


The
Sandy
Hook
Elementary
School
shooting
occurred
on
December
14
,
2012
,
in
Newtown
,
Connecticut
,
United
States
,
when
20-year-old
Adam
Lanza
shot
and
killed
26
people
,
including
20
children
between
six
and
seven
years
old
,
and
six
adult
staff
members
.


Before
driving
to
the
school
,
he
shot
and
killed
his
mother
at
their
Newtown
home
.


As
first
responders
arrived
at
the
school
,
Lanza
committed
suicide
by
shooting
himself
in
the
head
.


The
incident
remains
the
deadliest
mass
shooting
at
either
a
high
school
or
grade
school
in
U.S.
history
and
the
fourth-deadliest
mass
shooting
by
a
single
person
in
U.S.
history
.


The
shooting
prompted
renewed
debate
about
gun
control
in
the
United
States
,
including
proposals
to
make
the
background-check
system
universal
,
and
for
new
federal
and
state
gun
legislation
banning
the
sale
and
manufacture
of
certain
types
of
semi-automatic
firearms
and
magazines
with
more
than
ten
rounds
of
ammunition
.


A
November
2013
report
issued
by
the
Connecticut
State
Attorney
's
office
concluded
that
Lanza
acted
alone
and
planned
his
actions
,
but
provided
no
indication
why
he
did
so
,
or
why
he
targeted
the
school
.


A
report
issued
by
the
Office
of
the
Child
Advocate
in
November
2014
said
that
Lanza
had
Asperger
syndrome
and
as
a
teenager
suffered
from
depression
,
anxiety
and
obsessive-compulsive
disorder
,
but
concluded
that
they
had
``
neither
caused
nor
led
to
his
murderous
acts
.
''


The
report
went
on
to
say
,
``
his
severe
and
deteriorating
internalized
mental
health
problems
...
combined
with
an
atypical
preoccupation
with
violence
...
(
and
)
access
to
deadly
weapons
...
proved
a
recipe
for
mass
murder
''

The
Columbian
Chemicals
plant
explosion
was
a
hoax
claiming
an
explosion
at
a
chemical
plant
in
Centerville
,
St.
Mary
Parish
,
Louisiana
.


On
September
11
,
2014
,
reports
of
an
alleged
explosion
were
sent
to
local
residents
via
text
messages
and
spread
through
various
social
media
.


Several
reports
claimed
that
the
militant
group
ISIS
had
taken
responsibility
for
the
attack
.


St.
Mary
Parish
officials
claimed
that
the
reports
of
an
explosion
were
a
hoax
.


A
spokesperson
for
the
company
told
reporters
that
the
reports
of
an
explosion
were
a
hoax
:
The
hoax
was
reported
to
have
involved
``
dozens
of
fake
accounts
that
posted
hundreds
of
tweets
for
hours
,
targeting
a
list
of
figures
precisely
chosen
to
generate
maximum
attention
.


The
perpetrators
didn
’
t
just
doctor
screenshots
from
CNN
;
they
also
created
fully
functional
clones
of
the
websites
of
Louisiana
TV
stations
and
newspapers
.
''


It
was
one
of
``
a
wave
of
similar
attacks
''
in
the
US
during
the
second
half
of
2014
that
used
hoaxes
(
including
fabricated
ebola
outbreaks
and
police
shootings
)
in
an
attempt
to
create
public
panic
or
outrage
.


The
Parker
Middle
School
dance
shooting

an
incident
that
occurred
on

at

facility
in
Edinboro
,
Pennsylvania
,
United

at
Nick

Place
(
a
nearby
banquet
hall
)
during
an
8th
grade
dinner
dance
.


Prior
to
the
shooting
,
Andrew
Wurst
was
described
as
an
average
student
,
and
somewhat
of
a
loner
.


One
student
noticed
that
he
had
become
curt
and
unfriendly
prior
to
the
shooting
,
and
had
told
others
that
he
wanted
to
``

sentenced
to
60
years
in

the
uprising
tour
was
a
concert
tour
organised
to
support
the
album
``
uprising
''
by
bob
marley
and
the
wailers
.


It
was
Marley
's
last
tour
and
the
biggest
music
tour
of
Europe
in
that
year
.


The
tour
started
at
the
Hallenstadion
in
Zürich
,
Switzerland
,
where
Marley
performed
for
the
first
time
,
on
30
May
1980
,
and
ended
at
the
Stanley
Theater
in
Pittsburgh
,
on
23
September
1980
,
which
was
Marley
's
last
concert
.


Two
days
prior
to
the
Pittsburgh
show
,
after
playing
two
shows
at
the
Madison
Square
Garden
,
Marley
collapsed
in
Central
Park
while
jogging
,
and
was
told
to
immediately
cancel
the
U.S.
leg
of
the
tour
,
but
he
instead
flew
to
Pittsburgh
to
perform
one
final
performance
.


He
was
rumoured
to
go
out
on
stage
to
say
``
Hi
''
to
fans
with
Stevie
Wonder
during
his
performance
of
Master
Blaster
but
this
is
not
true
.


Marley
went
to
a
few
treatment
clinics
in
the
United
States
,
Boston
,
New
York
and
Miami
(
maybe
Mexico
)
.


Each
place
gave
him
only
a
month
to
live
.


Marley
then
left
for
Germany
to
receive
cancer
treatment
which
eventually
was
not
successful
but
prolonged
his
life
6
months
more
than
any
medical
clinic
in
the
United
States
predicted
,
as
Marley
died
in
May
1981
.


The
concert
in
Dortmund
on
13
June
has
been
broadcast
in
the
1990s
by
German
TV
station

their
Rockpalast
concert
series

Numerous
other
performances
from

have
also
been
taped
on

on
27
June
,
when
Marley
performed
for
about
120,000
people
in

sold-out
San

stadium
,
is
still
regarded
in

The
Battle
of
Ramales
,
a
battle
of
the
First
Carlist
War
,
occurred
at
Ramales
in
Cantabria
on
May
12
,
1839
.


The
Liberals
were
commanded
by
Baldomero
Espartero
,
the
Carlists
by
Rafael
Maroto
.


The
Liberals
,
initially
outnumbering
the
Carlists
twice
over
,
ended
up
having
four
times
as
many
forces
.


This
resulted
from
the
fact
that
Maroto
kept
eight
of
his
seventeen
battalions
in
reserve
and
had
ordered
the
defenders
of
the
fortification
of
Guardamino
to
abandon
this
post
.


Maroto
was
later
accused
of
complicity
with
his
opponent
Espartero
for
having
performed
these
two
actions
.


Espartero
ordered
Leopoldo
O'Donnell
to
attack
the
Carlists
positioned
in
the
heights
of
Mazo
,
while
Ramón
Castañeda
was
ordered
by
Espartero
to
attack
the
Carlists
at
the
Peña
del
Moro
.


Ramales
was
battered
by
the
Isabeline
artillery
,
but
the
Liberals
were
only
able
to
take
this
town
after
annihilating
a
Carlist
force
of
27
men
entrenched
in
a
nearby
cave
.


There
are
different
versions
of
the
story
of
how
this
annihilation
took
place
.


Some
attribute
the
actions
of
the
Liberal
guerrilla
Juan
Ruiz
Gutierrez
,
known
as
``
Cobanes
''
,
and
say
that
Cobanes
threw
straw
into
the
cave
and
then
set
it
on
fire
,
thereby
dislodging
the
Carlist
defenders
.


Others
attribute
the
victory
to
a
7-hour
siege
of
artillery
or
the
use
of
Congreve
rockets
.


Ramales
was
ultimately
conquered
but
was
destroyed
both
by
the
Carlist
forces
in
retreat
and
by
the
Liberal
occupiers
.


Ramales
was
renamed
``
Ramales
de
La
Victoria
''
after
the
battle
,
and
Espartero
received
the
title
of
``
Duque
de
La
Victoria
''
(
Duke
of
La
Victoria
)
.


For
the
Carlists
,
the
loss
of
Ramales
meant
that
they
had
to
evacuate
the
valley
of
Carranza
,
lost
the
metal
foundry
at
Guriezo
,
and
had
to
abandon
the
chance
to
operate
from
Cantabrian
lands
and
potentially
invade
Asturias
and
Galicia
.

,
1947
)
is
an
American
politician
and
prosecutor
.


He
was
the
Los
Angeles
County
District
Attorney
from
2000
to
2012
.

2004
and

the
Republican

California
Attorney
General

John
C.
Eastman
and
Tom

in
the
June

Cooley
said
he
would
defend
Proposition
8
,
a
2008

measure
that
banned

in
California
but
was
then

.

lost
to
the
Democratic

,
San
Francisco
District
Attorney
Kamala

,
in
the

Operation
Weserübung
(
)
was
the
code
name
for
Germany
's
assault
on
Denmark
and
Norway
during
the
Second
World
War
and
the
opening
operation
of
the
Norwegian
Campaign
.


The
name
comes
from
the
German
for
``
Operation
Weser-Exercise
''
,
the
Weser
being
a
German
river
.


In
the
early
morning
of
9
April
1940
(
``
Wesertag
''
,
``
Weser
Day
''
)
,
Germany
occupied
Denmark
and
invaded
Norway
,
ostensibly
as
a
preventive
manoeuvre
against
a
planned
,
and
openly
discussed
,
Franco-British
occupation
of
Norway
known
as
Plan
R
4
.


After
the
occupation
of
Denmark
(
the
Danish
military
was
ordered
to
stand
down
as
Denmark
did
not
declare
war
with
Germany
)
,
envoys
of
the
Germans
informed
the
governments
of
Denmark
and
Norway
that
the
``
Wehrmacht
''
had
come
to
protect
the
countries
'
neutrality
against
Franco-British
aggression
.


Significant
differences
in
geography
,
location
and
climate
between
the
two
nations
made
the
actual
military
operations
very
dissimilar
.


The
invasion
fleet
's
nominal
landing
time
,
``
Weserzeit
''
(
``
Weser
Time
''
)
,
was
set
to
05:15
.

from
Surabaya
,

,
to
Colombo
,
Sri

was
operated
on
behalf
of

Indonesia
.


On
4
December
1974
,
the
aircraft
,
a
McDonnell
Douglas
DC-8-55CF
,
crashed
into
a
mountain
shortly
before

,
killing
all
191
people
aboard
–
182
Indonesian
hajj
pilgrims
bound
for
Mecca
,
and
9
crew
members
.


The

is
said
to
have
departed
Surabaya
,
Indonesia
at
approximately
12.03
UTC
heading
to
Jeddah
planning
a
stop
at
Bandaranaike
Airport
,
Colombo
,
Sri
Lanka
.


at
around
16.30
utc
colombo
control
cleared
the
flight
.


at
16.38
utc
another
air
traffic
controller
is
said
to
have
intervened
and
cleared
the
flight
down
to
5000
feet
and
reported
clearing
to
8000
feet
.


Colombo
approach
then
cleared
the
flight
down
to
2000
feet
at
16.44
and
told
the
flight
to
expect
a
runway
04
approach
.


The
crew
aboard
the
flight
were
then
asked
to
report
when
the
airfield
was
in
sight
.


The
crew
then
continued
their
descent
until
the
aircraft
crashed
into
Saptha
Kanya
Mountain
at
an
altitude
of
approximately
4,355
feet
and
at
around
40
nm
east
of
Colombo
.


All
191
passengers
and
crew
were
killed
.


the
crash
remains
the
deadliest
in
sri

and
the
unk
involving
a
dc-8
,
after
arrow
air
flight
1285
and

.


At
the
time
,
it
was
the
second-deadliest
aviation
accident
,
after
the
loss
of
Turkish
Airlines
Flight
981
which
occurred
earlier
that
same
year
.

The
final
and
complete
withdrawal
of
Soviet
combatant
forces
from
Afghanistan
began
on
15
May
1988
and
ended
on
15
February
1989
under
the
leadership
of
Colonel-General
Boris
Gromov
.


planning
for
the
withdrawal
of
the
soviet
union
(
ussr
)
from
the
afghanistan
war
began
soon
after
mikhail
gorbachev
became
the
general
secretary
of
the
central
committee
of
the
communist
party
of
the
soviet
union
.


Under
the
leadership
of
Gorbachev
,
the
Soviet
Union
attempted
to
consolidate
the
PDPA
's
hold
over
power
in
the
country
,
first
in
a
genuine
effort
to
stabilize
the
country
,
and
then
as
a
measure
to
save
face
while
withdrawing
troops
.


During
this
period
,
the
military
and
intelligence
organizations
of
the
USSR
worked
with
the
government
of
Mohammad
Najibullah
to
improve
relations
between
the
government
in
Kabul
and
the
leaders
of
rebel
factions
.


The
diplomatic
relationship
between
the
USSR
and
the
United
States
improved
at
the
same
time
as
it
became
clear
to
the
Soviet
Union
that
this
policy
of
consolidating
power
around
Najibullah
's
government
in
Kabul
would
not
produce
sufficient
results
to
maintain
the
power
of
the
PDPA
in
the
long
run
.


The
Geneva
Accords
,
signed
by
representatives
of
the
USSR
,
the
US
,
the
Islamic
Republic
of
Pakistan
and
the
Republic
of
Afghanistan
(
thus
renamed
in
1987
)
on
14
April
1988
,
provided
a
framework
for
the
departure
of
Soviet
forces
,
and
established
a
multilateral
understanding
between
the
signatories
regarding
the
future
of
international
involvement
in
Afghanistan
.


The
military
withdrawal
commenced
soon
after
,
with
all
Soviet
forces
leaving
Afghanistan
by
15
February
1989
.


Events
leading
up
to
military
withdrawal
.


Understanding
that
the
Soviet
Union
's
troublesome
economic
and
international
situation
was
complicated
by
its
involvement
in
the
Afghan
War
,
Gorbachev
``
had
decided
to
seek
a
withdrawal
from
Afghanistan
and
had
won
the
support
of
the
Politburo
to
do
so
[
by
October
1985
]
''
.


He
later
strengthened
his
support
base
at
the
top
level
of
Soviet
government
further
by
expanding
the
Politburo
with
his
allies
.


To
fulfill
domestic
and
foreign
expectations
,
Gorbachev
aimed
to
withdraw
having
achieved
some
degree
of
success
.


at
home
,
gorbachev
was
forced
to
satisfy
the
hawkish
military-industrial
complex
,
military
leadership
,
and
intelligence
agencies
(
later
,
gorbachev
would
tell
un
envoy
diego
cordovez
that
the
impact
of
the
war
lobby
should
not
be
overestimated
;
cordovez
recalls
that
gorbachev
's
advisors
were
not
unanimous
in
this
pronouncement
,
but
all
agreed
that
disagreements
with
the
us
,
pakistan
,
and
realities
in
kabul
played
a
bigger
role
in
delaying
withdrawal
)
.


Abroad
,
Gorbachev
aimed
to
retain
prestige
in
the
eyes
of
third-world
allies
.


He
,
like
Soviet
leaders
before
him
,
considered
only
a
dignified
withdrawal
to
be
acceptable
.


This
necessitated
the
creation
of
stability
within
Afghanistan
,
which
the
Soviet
Union
would
attempt
to
accomplish
until
its
eventual
withdrawal
in
1988-9
.


Three
objectives
were
viewed
by
Gorbachev
as
conditions
needed
for
withdrawal
:
internal
stability
,
limited
foreign
intervention
,
and
international
recognition
of
the
Democratic
Republic
of
Afghanistan
's
Communist
government
.

the
cape
grim
massacre
was
an
incident
on
10
february
1828
in
which
a
group
of
aboriginal
tasmanians
gathering
food
at
a
beach
in
the
north-west
of
tasmania
is
said
to
have
been
ambushed
and
shot
by
four
van
diemen
's
land
company
(
unk
)
workers
,
with
bodies
of
some
of
the
victims
then
thrown
from
a
cliff
.


About
30
men
are
thought
to
have
been
killed
in
the
attack
,
which
was
a
reprisal
action
for
an
earlier
Aboriginal
raid
on
a
flock
of
Van
Diemen
's
Land
Company
sheep
,
but
part
of
an
escalating
spiral
of
violence
probably
triggered
by
the
abduction
and
rape
of
Aboriginal
women
in
the
area
.


The
massacre
was
part
of
the
``
Black
War
''
,
the
period
of
violent
conflict
between
British
colonists
and
Aboriginal
Australians
in
Tasmania
from
the
mid-1820s
to
1832
.


news
of
the
cape
grim
killings
did
not
reach
governor
george
arthur
for
almost
two
years
.


Arthur
sent
George
Augustus
Robinson
,
who
held
an
unofficial
government
role
as
an
Aboriginal
conciliator
,
to
investigate
the
incident
,
and
later
statements
from
company
workers
,
a
diary
entry
by
the
wife
of
a
ship
's
captain
and
the
testimony
of
an
Aboriginal
woman
provided
some
further
information
.


Despite
the
witness
statements
however
,
detail
of
what
took
place
is
sketchy
and
Australian
author
Keith
Windschuttle
and
some
other
historians
have
subsequently
disputed
the
magnitude
of
the
massacre
or
denied
it
occurred
at
all
.


The
site
of
the
massacre
has
been
identified
as
the
present-day
Suicide
Bay
,
facing
the
island
outcrops
known
as
The
Doughboys
.


Because
a
number
of
tribes
were
in
the
area
at
the
time
,
it
is
uncertain
which
one
was
involved
in
the
clash
,
although
historian
Lyndall
Ryan
states
that
those
killed
were
members
of
the
Peerapper
clan
.


At
approximately
noon
local
time
on
Saturday
,
15
March
2008
,
at
an
ex-military
ammunition
depot
in
the
village
of
Gërdec
in
the
Vorë
Municipality
,
Albania
(
14
kilometers
from
Tirana
,
the
nation
's
capital
)
,
U.S
and
Albanian
munitions
experts
were
preparing
to
destroy
stockpiles
of
obsolete
ammunition
.


The
methodical
destruction
of
the
old
ammo
was
supposed
to
occur
with
a
series
of
small
,
controlled
explosions
,
but
a
chain
of
events
led
to
the
entire
stockpile
going
up
at
once
.


The
main
explosion
,
involving
more
than
400
tons
of
propellant
in
containers
,
destroyed
hundreds
of
houses
within
a
few
kilometers
from
the
depot
and
broke
windows
in
cars
on
the
Tirana-Durrës
highway
.


A
large
fire
caused
a
series
of
smaller
but
powerful
explosions
that
continued
until
2
a.m.
on
Sunday
.


The
explosions
could
be
heard
as
far
away
as
the
Macedonian
capital
of
Skopje
,
away
.


Thousands
of
artillery
shells
,
most
of
them
un-exploded
,
littered
the
area
.


The
blast
shattered
all
the
windows
of
the
terminal
building
at
the
country
's
only
international
airport
,
and
all
flights
were
suspended
for
some
40
minutes
.


Some
4,000
inhabitants
of
the
zone
were
evacuated
and
offered
shelter
in
state-owned
resorts
.


The
Government
declared
the
zone
a
disaster
area
.


According
to
subsequent
investigations
,
a
privately
managed
ammo
dismantling
process
was
ongoing
in
the
area
.


The
murder
of
Tia
Sharp
(
30
June
2000
–
2–3
August
2012
)
was
a
high-profile
case
of
child
murder
in
the
United
Kingdom
.


The
victim
was
a
12-year-old
girl
,
Tia
Sharp
,
who
was
reported
missing
from
and
later
found
dead
in
the
home
of
her
grandmother
in
New
Addington
,
London
,
in
August
2012
.


After
her
body
was
discovered
,
police
arrested
her
grandmother
,
Christine
Bicknell
,
and
Christine
's
then-boyfriend
,
Stuart
Hazell
on
suspicion
of
murder
.


Hazell
was
charged
with
Tia
Sharp
's
murder
on
12
August
.


Five
days
into
his
trial
at
the
Old
Bailey
in
May
2013
,
Hazell
changed
his
plea
from
not
guilty
to
guilty
.


He
was
sentenced
to
life
imprisonment
with
the
judge
setting
a
minimum
term
of
38
years
.

was
a
French
invasion
that
took
place
between
16
and
18
June
1779
during
the
Anglo-French
War
.


A
French
force
commander
named
Charles

the
British-controlled
part
of
the
island
,
assisted
by
local
Black
Caribs
who
held
the
northern
part
of
the
island
.


British
Governor
Valentine

and
military
commander
Lieutenant
Colonel
George

disagreed
on
how
to
react
and
ended
up
surrendering
without
significant
resistance
.


Both
leaders
were
subjected
to
inquiries
over
the
surrender

The
period
of
French

which
resulted
in
a

The
Great
Train
Wreck
of
1918
occurred
on
July
9
,
1918
,
in
Nashville
,
Tennessee
.


Two
passenger
trains
,
operated
by
the
Nashville
,
Chattanooga
and
St.
Louis
Railway
(
``
NC
&
StL
''
)
,
collided
head-on
,
costing
at
least
101
lives
and
injuring
an
additional
171
.


It
is
considered
the
worst
rail
accident
in
United
States
history
,
though
estimates
of
the
death
toll
of
this
accident
overlap
with
that
of
the
Malbone
Street
Wreck
in
Brooklyn
the
same
year
.


The
two
trains
involved
were
the
No

to
depart
Nashville
for
Memphis

Tennessee
at
7:00

about
a
half-hour
late
for
a

arrival
in
nashville
at

at
about
7:20
a.m.
,
the
two

collided
while
traversing
a
section
of
single

line
known
as
``
dutchman
's
curve
''
west
of
downtown
,
in
the
present-day
neighborhood
of
belle
meade
.


The
trains
were
each
traveling
at
an
estimated
50
to
60
miles
per
hour
;
the
impact
derailed
them
both
,
and
destroyed
several
wooden
cars
.


an
investigation
by
the
interstate
commerce
commission
(
icc
)
attributed
the
cause
of
the
accident
to
several
factors
,
notably
serious
errors
by
the
crew
of
train

,
all
of
whom
failed
to
properly
account
for

on
the
line
.


The
ICC
also
pointed
to
a
lack
of
a
proper
system
for
the
accurate
determination
of
train
positions
and
noted
that
the
wooden
construction
of
the
cars
greatly
increased
the
number
of
fatalities
.


During
12–16
August
1969
,
there
was
an
outbreak
of
political
and
sectarian
violence
in
Northern
Ireland
,
which
is
often
seen
as
the
beginning
of
the
thirty-year
conflict
known
as
the
Troubles
.


There
had
been
sporadic
violence
throughout
the
year
arising
out
of
the
civil
rights
campaign
,
which
demanded
an
end
to
discrimination
against
Catholics
and
Irish
nationalists
.


Civil
rights
marches
had
been
repeatedly
attacked
by
Ulster
Protestant
loyalists
and
also
came
into
frequent
conflict
with
the
Royal
Ulster
Constabulary
(
RUC
)
,
the
overwhelmingly
Protestant
police
force
.


On
12
August
,
the
Battle
of
the
Bogside
erupted
in
Derry
;
three
days
of
fierce
clashes
in
the
Bogside
district
between
the
RUC
and
thousands
of
Catholic/nationalist
residents
.


The
besieged
residents
built
barricades
and
set
up
first
aid
posts
and
workshops
for
making
petrol
bombs
.


Police
fired
CS
gas
at
rioters
for
the
first
time
in
the
United
Kingdom
.


In
support
of
the
Bogsiders
,
on
13
August
Catholics/nationalists
held
protests
elsewhere
in
Northern
Ireland
,
some
of
which
led
to
violence
.


The
bloodiest
clashes
were
in
Belfast
,
where
seven
people
were
killed
and
hundreds
wounded
.


Protesters
clashes
with
both
the
police
and
with
loyalists
,
who
attacked
Catholic
districts
.


Scores
of
homes
and
businesses
were
burnt
out
,
most
of
them
owned
by
Catholics
,
and
thousands
of
mostly
Catholic
families
were
driven
from
their
homes
.


In
some
cases
,
police
officers
helped
the
loyalists
and
failed
to
protect
Catholic
areas
.


Both
republican
and
loyalist
paramilitaries
were
involved
in
the
clashes
.


The
events
in
Belfast
are
viewed
by
some
as
an
attempted
pogrom
against
the
Catholic
minority
.


There
were
also
clashes
between
protesters
and
police
in
Armagh
(
where
a
protester
was
killed
)
,
Dungannon
and
Newry
.


The
British
Army
was
deployed
to
restore
order
on
14
August
,
beginning
the
37-year
Operation
Banner
,
and
peace
lines
were
built
to
separate
Catholic
and
Protestant
districts
.


The
Republic
of
Ireland
's
government
set
up
field
hospitals
and
refugee
centres
near
the
border
,
and
called
for
a
United
Nations
peacekeeping
force
to
be
sent
to
Northern
Ireland
.


The
British
government
held
an
inquiry
into
the
riots
,
and
the
reserve
police
force
was
disbanded
.


The
riots
led
to
the
formation
of
the
Provisional
Irish
Republican
Army
and
the
growth
of
loyalist
paramilitaries
.


The
Jyväskylä
rail
accident
occurred
on
6
March
1998
in
Jyväskylä
,
Finland
,
when
the
Sr1-driven
express
train
P105
from
Turku
bound
for
Joensuu
via
Pieksämäki
derailed
.


The
train
left
the
tracks
after
coming
in
too
fast
on
a
switch
near
the
station
.


300
people
were
on
board
(
some
sources
say
500
)
;
the
fireman
driving
the
train
and
nine
passengers
were
killed
,
and
94
passengers
injured
.


The
investigation
found
the
cause
of
the
accident
to
be
human
error
when
interpreting
signals
.


The
driver
of
the
train
was
expecting
the
train
to
enter
the
station
on
another
track
,
which
had
a
higher
speed
limit
of
.


An
estimate
of
the
total
cost
of
the
accident
was
21.5
million
FIM
(
3.6
million
euros
)
.


The
Elliot
Junction
rail
accident
occurred
on
28
December
1906
between
Arbroath
railway
station
and
Carnoustie
railway
station
in
Scotland
,
with
22
fatalities
.


A
Dundee
and
Arbroath
Railway
train
was
standing
at
Elliot
Junction
railway
station
during
a
blizzard
when
it
was
hit
by
a
North
British
Railway
train
.


The
Board
of
Trade
Inquiry
placed
primary
responsibility
on
the
driver
of
one
of
the
trains
who
had
``
failed
to
heed
instructions
to
drive
with
caution
''
.


It
also
discussed
the
role
of
alcohol
and
said
that
``
the
proximity
of
the
Victoria
Bar
to
the
up
platform
is
a
very
undesirable
feature
in
the
surroundings
of
[
Arbroath
]
station
.


The
substitution
of
a
coffee
shop
and
refreshment
room
would
be
greatly
in
the
general
interests
of
the
staff
''
.


One
of
those
injured
in
the
crash
was
the
Liberal
Member
of
Parliament
(

Alexander
William
Black
,
who
died
of
his
injuries
shortly
afterwards

1673
(
11
August
O.S

)


between
the
Dutch
and
the
combined
English
and
French
fleets
.


It
was
the
last
major
battle
of
the
Third
Anglo-Dutch
War
,
which
was
itself
part
of
the
Franco-Dutch
War
(
1672–1678
)
,
during
which
Louis

of
France
invaded
the
Republic
and
sought
to
establish
control
over
the
Spanish
Netherlands
.


english
involvement
came
about
because
of
the
treaty
of
dover
,
secretly
concluded
by
charles
ii
of
england
,
and
which
was
highly
unpopular
with
the
english
parliament
.


The
overall
commanders
of
the
English
and
Dutch
military
forces
were
Lord
High
Admiral
James
,
Duke
of

,
afterwards
King
James
II
of
England
,
and
Admiral-General
William
III
of
Orange
,
James
'
son-in-law
and
also
a
future
King
of
England
.


Neither
of
them
took
part
in
the
fight
.


Prince
Rupert
of
the
Rhine
commanded
the
Allied
fleet
of
about
92
ships
and
30
fireships
,
taking
control
of
the
centre
himself
,
with
Jean

d'Estrées
commanding
the

,
and
Sir
Edward
Spragge
the
rear
division
.


The
Dutch
fleet
of
75
ships
and

,
with
Lieutenant-Admirals
Adriaen
Banckert
in
charge
of
the
van
and
Cornelis
Tromp

The
Dutch
were
also
disadvantaged
due
to
their
warships
being
on
the
average
smaller
than
both
their
English
and
French
opponents
.


The
Restoring

rally
was
held

.


Billed
as
a
``
celebration
of
America
's
heroes
and
heritage
,
''
several
veterans
were
honored
.


Along
with
Beck
,
the
speakers
included

Republican
vice
presidential

and
activist
Alveda
King
,
a
niece
of

Beck
's
speech
urged
Americans
of
all
religions
to
turn
to
their
faith
in
God
,
``
turning
our
face
back
to
the
values
and
principles
that
made
us
great

''


Beck
's
and
Palin
's
speeches
praised
George
Washington
,
Abraham
Lincoln
,
and
Martin
Luther
King

,
as
well
as
American
war
veterans
.


Beck
called
for
Americans
to
unite
despite
political

The
attendance
at
the
rally
was
disputed
:
a
scientific
estimate
placed
the
crowd
size
around
87,000
,
while
media
reports
varied
wildly
from
tens
of
thousands
to
500,000
.


The
event
was
held
at
the
Lincoln
Memorial
,
the
same
location

and
the
47th
anniversary
of
the
1963
March
on
Washington
and
Martin
Luther
King
Jr.
's
historic
``

Have
a
Dream

speech
,
drawing
criticism
from
African
American
leaders
who
believed
the
rally
was
clouding
the
legacy
of
the
Civil

.


The
Battle
of
Koromo
River
took
place
during
the
opening
years
of
the
Kamakura
period
(
12th
century
)
of
Japan
.


After
the
destruction
of
the
Heike
,
Minamoto
no
Yoshitsune
conflicted
with
his
brother
Minamoto
no
Yoritomo
,
and
fled
into
Hiraizumi
,
Mutsu
Province
.


He
was
sheltered
by
Northern
Fujiwara
's
3rd
ruler
Fujiwara
no
Hidehira
.


Hidehira
appointed
Yoshitsune
as
general
to
be
opposed
to
Yoritomo
,
but
he
died
of
illness
on
October
29
,
1187
.


Yoritomo
strongly
pressured
Fujiwara
no
Yasuhira
,
the
2nd
son
and
successor
of
Hidehira
,
through
the
Imperial
Court
to
arrest
Yoshitsune
.


Against
the
will
of
his
father
,
Yasuhira
succumbed
to
the
repeated
pressure
of
Yoritomo
.


On
June
15
,
1189
,
he
led
500
soldiers
to
attack
Yoshitsune
and
an
entourage
of
servants
in
the
Koromogawa
no
tachi
residence
.


Yasuhira
defeated
Yoshitsune
and
his
compatriot
,
Saitō
no
Musashibō
Benkei
.


Throughout
the
battle
,
Benkei
defended
his
lord
.


Benkei
supposedly
died
standing
up
,
which
caused
great
fear
in
his
enemies
.


Yoshitsune
himself
committed
suicide
at
the
end
of
the
battle
.


The
2012–13
Ranji
Trophy
was
the
79th
season
of
the
Ranji
Trophy
.


It
was
contested
by
27
teams
divided
into
three
groups
of
nine
teams
each
.


The
top
three
teams
from
Groups
A
and
B
proceeded
to
the
quarterfinals
along
with
the
top
two
teams
from
Group
C.
Mumbai
won
this
year
's
trophy
for
the
40th
time
by
beating
Saurashtra
in
the
final
at
the
Wankhede
.


The
season
had
a
different
grouping
system
compared
to
that
of
the
previous
seasons
,
which
had
Elite
and
Plate
divisions
.


The
new
system
also
increased
the
number
of
matches
of
the
tournament
.


The
points
awarded
to
outright
wins
were
increased
from
five
to
six
in
order
to
encourage
results
.


The
knock-out
matches
will
be
played
across
five
days
instead
of
four
.


All
these
changes
were
recommended
by
the
BCCI
's
Technical
Committee
in
June
2012
.


The
Barricades
(
)
were
a
series
of
confrontations
between
the
Republic
of
Latvia
and
the
Union
of
Soviet
Socialist
Republics
in
January
1991
which
took
place
mainly
in
Riga
.


The
events
are
named
for
the
popular
effort
of
building
and
protecting
barricades
from
13
January
until
about
27
January
.


Latvia
,
which
had
declared
restoration
of
independence
from
the
Soviet
Union
a
year
earlier
,
anticipated
that
Soviet
Union
might
attempt
to
regain
control
over
the
country
by
force
.


After
attacks
by
the
Soviet
OMON
on
Riga
in
early
January
,
the
government
called
on
people
to
build
barricades
for
protection
of
possible
targets
(
mainly
in
the
capital
city
of
Riga
and
nearby
Ulbroka
,
as
well
as
Kuldīga
and
Liepāja
)
.


Six
people
were
killed
in
further
attacks
,
several
were
wounded
in
shootings
or
beaten
by
OMON
.


Most
victims
were
shot
during
the
Soviet
attack
on
the
Latvian
Ministry
of
the
Interior
on
January
20
.


One
other
person
died
in
a
building
accident
reinforcing
the
barricades
.


Casualties
among
Soviet
loyalists
are
considered
likely
,
but
the
exact
number
remains
unknown
.


A
total
of
15,611
people
have
registered
as
having
been
participants
of
the
Barricades
,
but
other
data
suggests
that
more
than
32,000
Latvians
took
part
.

The
unseasonable
rain
and
hailstorm
across
all
North
India
and
its
connected
states
caused
heavy
damage
to
the
crops
of
the
Rabi
Harvest
in
March
2015
.


Usually
this
period
of
the
year
does
not
get
rain
but
this
year
heavy
rainfall
destroyed
most
of
the
winter
harvest
that
was
near
to
being
cut
.


It
directly
affected
normal
life
,
especially
of
farmers
who
lost
their
harvest
for
this
season
.


Because
of
the
crop
damage
on
a
large
scale
,
increases
in
the
prices
of
basic
food
items
occurred
.


Approximately
106
lakh
hectares
harvest
was
damaged
and
80
farmers
attempted
suicide
in
March
alone
.


It
is
recorded
as
the
wettest
March
in
48
years
.


The
Aktion
Erntefest
(
)
was
a
World
War
II
mass
shooting
action
carried
out
by
the
SS
,
the
Order
police
,
and
the
Ukrainian
``
Sonderdienst
''
formations
in
the
General
Government
territory
of
occupied
Poland
.


The
operation
aimed
at
extermination
of
Jews
pressed
into
forced-labour
at
the
camps
of
the
Lublin
reservation
including
Majdanek
concentration
camp
and
all
its
subcamps
.


It
was
closely
linked
with
the
liquidation
of
the
ghetto
in
Lublin
.


``
Aktion
Erntefest
''
took
place
on
November
3
and
4
,
1943
.


On
the
orders
of
Christian
Wirth
and
Jakob
Sporrenberg
,
approximately
42,000–43,000
Polish
Jews
were
killed
simultaneously
.


Virtually
the
entire
Jewish
workforce
was
eliminated
,
thus
concluding
Operation
Reinhard
.


Operation
Harvest
Festival
was
the
single
largest
German
massacre
of
Jews
in
the
entire
war
.


It
surpassed
the
notorious
massacre
of
more
than
33,000
Jews
at
Babi
Yar
outside
Kiev
by
10,000
victims
.


It
was
exceeded
only
by
the
1941
Odessa
massacre
of
more
than
50,000
Jews
in
October
1941
,
committed
by
Romanian
troops
.


A
terrorist
attack
took
place
on
26
June
2015
in
Saint-Quentin-Fallavier
,
near
Lyon
,
France
,
when
a
Muslim
North
African
man
,
Yassin
Salhi
,
decapitated
his
employer
Hervé
Cornara
and
drove
his
van
into
gas
cylinders
at
a
gas
factory
in
Saint-Quentin-Fallavier
near
Lyon
,
France
,
which
caused
an
explosion
that
injured
two
other
people
.


Salhi
was
arrested
and
charged
with
murder
and
attempted
murder
linked
to
terrorism
.


Three
other
people
were
questioned
by
the
police
but
released
without
charge
.


Salhi
committed
suicide
in
jail
in
December
.


The
attack
occurred
on
the
same
day
as
several
other
Islamist
terrorist
attacks
,
which
have
subsequently
been
named
the
2015
Ramadan
attacks
,
though
any
relationship
between
the
various
incidents
is
disputed
.


French
authorities
believe
that
Salhi
has
links
with
the
Islamist
terrorist
group
the
Islamic
State
of
Iraq
and
Syria
(
ISIS
)
.


The
attack
occurred
during
heightened
public
fears
over
Islamist
attacks
in
France
,
a
few
months
after
the
Île-de-France
attacks
in
January
2015
,
including
the
``
Charlie
Hebdo
''
shooting
.

a
group
of
knife-wielding
terrorists
attacked
passengers
at
the
city
's
railway
station
.


Both
male
and
female

On
3
March
,
police
announced
that
the
six-man
,
two-woman
group
had
been
neutralized
after
the
arrest
of
three
remaining
suspects
.


No
group
stepped
forward
to
claim
responsibility
for
the
attack
.


Xinhua
News
Agency
and
the
government
of
Kunming
said
that
the
attack
had
been
linked
to
Xinjiang
separatist
terrorists
,
with
``

and
``
The
New

Times
''
also
reporting
that
members
of
Xinjiang
's
Uyghur
Muslims
were
involved
in
the

Police
said
that
they
had
confiscated
a
black

hand-painted
East
Turkestan
flag
at
the
scene
,
which
is
associated
with
the
Xinjiang

The
shelling
of
the

on
28
August
1995
by
the
Serb
army
is
considered
to
be
the
immediate
instigating
factor

The
operation
was
carried
out
between

Hurricane
Madeline
is
tied
with
1992
's
Hurricane
Iniki
as
the
second-strongest
landfalling
tropical
cyclone
on
record
in
the
Eastern
Pacific
basin
,
only
behind
2015
's
Hurricane
Patricia
.


Madeline
formed
on
September
29
,
not
far
from
Central
America
.


The
next
day
,
the
circulation
dissipated
,
and
as
a
result
weakened
to
a
remnant
low
.


Four
days
later
,
on
October
3
,
the
low
regenerated
into
a
tropical
depression
.


The
system
remained
weak
for
three
days
as
it
drifted
west-northwest
.


When
it
began
to
recurve
towards
Mexico
on
October
6
,
the
cyclone
rapidly
intensified
,
eventually
making
landfall
at
peak
intensity
as
a
Category
4
.


Shortly
after
landfall
,
the
cyclone
rapidly
dissipated
.


Prior
to
the
arrival
of
Madeline
,
15,000
people
evacuated
form
the
coast
,
which
had
already
been
impacted
by
Hurricane

Heavy
damage
was
reported

New

Organization
(

)
,
founded
by
composer
Joseph
Waters
in
Portland
,
Oregon
,
U.S.
in
1998
,
is
a
nonprofit
organization
based
in
San
Diego
,
California
that
produces
the
annual
international
festival
of
electro-acoustic
music
.


NWEAMO
is
dedicated
to
forging
connections
between
the
composers
,
performers
and
lovers
of
avant
garde
classical
music
with
the
DJ
’
s
,
MC
’
s
,
guitar-gods
,
troubadours
and
gourmets
of
experimental
popular
music
.


The
organization
promotes
music
that
involves
the
creative
use
of
computers
and
electronics
mixed
with
acoustics
.


Today
,
NWEAMO
has
showcased
artists
in
prime
venues
across
the
world
.


In
a
healthy
cultural
milieu
NWEAMO
celebrates
both
classical
and
popular
music
.


The
idea
behind
this
seemingly
controversial
connection
is
that
without
any
connection
,
both
genres
suffer
.


When
classical
music
does
not
connect
with
popular
culture
,
it
becomes
a
music
of
experts
,
unable
to
reflect
and
contribute
meaningfully
in
the
broad
marketplace
of
developing
ideas
and
cultural
experimentation
.


Popular
music
on
the
other
hand
,
becomes
naïve
and
superficial
,
untethered
to
its
historical
roots
and
broad
cultural
underpinnings
,
without
connection
and
communication
with
classical
music
.


NWEAMO
attempts
to
generate
a
synthesis
that
reveals
new
possibilities
for
both
.

shunter
passed
instructions
face-to-face
with
the
driver
whilst
they
waited
for
a
fish
train
to
pass
.


Once
his
signal
was
clear
the
shunter
signalled
the
driver
to

The
shunter
at
this
point
riding
on
the

the
three
carriage
trucks
,
at
this

were
clear
the
signalman
reversed
the

to
begin
the
propelling
movement
.


These
movements
were
completed
at
approximately
11.02

The
Austro-Prussian
War
or
Seven
Weeks
'
War
(
also
known
as
the
Unification
War
,
the
War
of
1866
,
the
Fraternal
War
,
in
Germany
as
the
German
War
,
and
also
by
a
variety
of
other
names
)
was
a
war
fought
in
1866
between
the
Austrian
Empire
and
the
Kingdom
of
Prussia
,
with
each
also
being
aided
by
various
allies
within
the
German
Confederation
.


Prussia
had
also
allied
with
the
Kingdom
of
Italy
,
linking
this
conflict
to
the
Third
Independence
War
of
Italian
unification
.


The
Austro-Prussian
War
was
part
of
the
wider
rivalry
between
Austria
and
Prussia
,
and
resulted
in
Prussian
dominance
over
the
German
states
.


The
major
result
of
the
war
was
a
shift
in
power
among
the
German
states
away
from
Austrian
and
towards
Prussian
hegemony
,
and
impetus
towards
the
unification
of
all
of
the
northern
German
states
in
a
that
excluded
the
German
Austria
.


It
saw
the
abolition
of
the
German
Confederation
and
its
partial
replacement
by
a
North
German
Confederation
that
excluded
Austria
and
the
other
South
German
states
.


The
war
also
resulted
in
the
Italian
annexation
of
the
Austrian
province
of
Venetia
.


The
Walsh
Street
police
shootings
were
the
1988
murders
of
two
Victoria
Police
officers
:
Constables
Steven
Tynan
,
22
,
and
Damian
Eyre
,

.


Tynan
and
Eyre
were
responding
to
a
report
of
an
abandoned
car
when
they
were
gunned
down
about
4:50am
in
Walsh
Street
,
South
Yarra
(
a
Melbourne
suburb
)
,
on
12
October
1988
.


Four
men
,
Victor
Peirce
,
Trevor
Pettingill
,
Anthony
Leigh
Farrell
and
Peter
David
McEvoy
,
were
charged
with
murder
and
later
acquitted
by
a
jury
in
the
Supreme
Court
of
Victoria
.


Two
other
suspects
,
Jedd
Houghton
and
Gary
Abdallah
,
were
shot
and
killed
by
Victoria
Police
before
being
brought
to
trial
.


During
2005
,
Wendy
Peirce
,
widow
of
Victor
,
gave
an
interview
to
the
mass
media
.


In
this
interview
,
she
stated
that
her
late
husband
had
planned
and
carried
out
the
murders
and
that
he
was
actually
guilty
as
charged
.


The
1941
Cabo
San
Lucas
hurricane
is
considered
one
of
the
worst
tropical
cyclones
on
record
to
affect
Cabo
San
Lucas
.


The
hurricane
was
first
reported
on
September
8
off
the
coast
of
Mexico
.


It
slowly
moved
northwestward
while
intensifying
.


After
peaking
in
intensity
,
it
entered
the
Gulf
of
California
,
and
weakened
rapidly
.


It
dissipated
on
September
13
.


This
system
brought
winds
and
heavy
rain
to
the
southern
tip
of
the
Baja
California
Peninsula
.


The
hurricane
destroyed
poorer
sections
of
La
Paz
and
its
nearby
villages
.


Two
villages
were
completely
destroyed
.


Furthermore
,
Cabo
San
Lucas
was
devastated
.


The
torrential
rains
damaged
roads
and
left
thousands
homeless
.


In
addition
,
the
hurricane
destroyed
the
tuna
canning
industry
in
San
José
del
Cabo
.


Throughout
the
devastated
peninsula
,
15
people
were
killed
,
and
many
others
were
injured
.


Initially
following
the
storm
,
Cabo
San
Lucas
was
abandoned
,
but
after
World
War
II
,
most
of
the
destroyed
buildings
were
rebuilt
.


The
remnants
of
the
storm
later
brought
rains
to
California
and
Arizona
,
peaking
at
at
Mormon
Lake
.


The
Siege
of
Fort
Erie
was
one
of
the
last
and
most
protracted
engagements
between
British
and
American
forces
during
the
Niagara
campaign
of
the
American
War
of
1812
.


From
4
August
to
21
September
1814
,
the
Americans
successfully
defended
Fort
Erie
against
a
British
army
.


During
the
siege
,
the
British
suffered
heavy
casualties
in
a
failed
storming
attempt
and
also
suffered
from
sickness
and
exposure
in
their
rough
encampments
.


Unaware
that
the
British
were
about
to
abandon
the
siege
,
the
American
garrison
later
launched
a
sortie
to
destroy
the
British
siege
batteries
,
during
which
both
sides
again
suffered
heavy
losses
.


After
the
British
abandoned
the
siege
,
the
reinforced
American
army
followed
up
cautiously
and
forced
a
second
retreat
at
Cook
's
Mills
,
but
with
the
onset
of
winter
and
shortage
of
supplies
they
later
withdrew
and
demolished
Fort
Erie
.


The
attempted
siege
ended
as
the
last
British
offensive
along
the
northern
border
.


Invicta

,
flying
from
Bristol
Lulsgate
to
Basel-Mulhouse
,
that
ploughed
into
a
snowy
,
forested
hillside
near
Hochwald
,
Switzerland
.


It
somersaulted
and
broke
up
,
killing
108
,
with
37
survivors
.


To
date
,
this
is
the
deadliest
accident
involving
a
Vickers
Vanguard
and
the
deadliest
aviation
accident
to
occur
on
Swiss
soil
.


Many
of
the
139
passengers
on
the
charter
flight
were

of
the
Axbridge
Ladies
Guild
,
from
the
Somerset
towns
and

,
Winscombe
and

Pilot
Anthony
Dorman
became
disoriented
,
misidentifying
two
radio
beacons
and
missing
another
.


When
co-pilot
Ivor
Terry
took
over
,
his
final
approach
was
based
on
the
wrong
beacon
and
the
aircraft
crashed
into
the
hillside
.

previously
been
suspended
from

eight
times
.


As
a
result
of
the
crash
tougher

were
introduced
in
the
UK
.


Despite
the
conclusions
of
the
official
Swiss
report
,
one
commentator
,
ex-KLM
pilot
Jan
Bartelski
,
has
argued
that
the
pilots
may
not
have
been
entirely
to
blame
and
that
there
is
a
possibility
that
they
were
led
off

Severe
Tropical
Cyclone
Kathy
was
a
powerful
tropical
cyclone
that
devastated
the
Sir
Edward
Pellew
Group
of
Islands
in
March
1984
.


Originating
from
a
tropical
low
off
the
southern
coast
of
Papua
New
Guinea
.


tracking
westward
,
the
system
attained
gale-force
winds
by
18
march
before
striking
the
cape
york
peninsula
.


After
crossing
the
area
,
Kathy
entered
the
Gulf
of
Carpentaria
where
environmental
conditions
favoured
significant
development
.


On
22
March
,
the
storm
attained
its
peak
intensity
as
a
Category
5
severe
tropical
cyclone
(
Australian
tropical
cyclone
intensity
scale
)
with
ten-minute
sustained
winds
of
205
km/h
(
125
mph
)
.


By
this
time
,
the
storm
had
been
tracking
towards
the
southwest
and
struck
the
Sir
Edward
Pellew
Group
of
Islands
later
on
22
March
before
moving
over
the
Australian
mainland
as
a
slightly
weaker
system
.


Once
over
land
,
Kathy
rapidly
degraded
,
losing
gale-force
winds
within
24
hours
;
the
storm
dissipated
over
the
Northern
Territory
on
24
March
.


Moving
through
the
Pellew
Islands
as
a
powerful
cyclone
,
Kathy
generated
a
maximum
storm
surge
of
and
winds
exceeding
.


Offshore
,
20
vessels
were
affected
,
one
of
which
sank
and
resulted
in
the
death
of
its
captain
.


In
mainland
Australia
,
the
system
struck
a
relatively
sparsely
populated
area
,
with
only
Borroloola
being
significantly
impacted
by
the
cyclone
.


Additionally
,
mangroves
at
along
the
McArthur
River
sustained
substantial
damage
.


Overall
,
losses
from
the
storm
were
placed
at
A
$
12
million
(
A
$
30.5
million
2011
AUD
;
US
$
24.1
million
2011
USD
)
.


Following
its
usage
,
the
name
``
Kathy
''
was
retired
and
will
never
be
used
again
to
name
an
Australian
cyclone
.


Hurricane
Klaus
was
a
minimal
Atlantic
hurricane
that
dropped
heavy
rainfall
across
the
Lesser
Antilles
in
October
1990
.


The
eleventh
tropical
cyclone
and
sixth
hurricane
of
the
1990
Atlantic
hurricane
season
,
Klaus
developed
from
a
tropical
wave
on
October
3
a
short
distance
east
of
Dominica
.


It
drifted
northwestward
,
and
quickly
intensified
to
attain
hurricane
status
on
October
5
.


though
its
closest
approach
to
the
lesser
antilles
was
within
12
miles
(
19
km
)
,
the
strongest
winds
remained
to
its
northeast
due
to
strong
wind
shear
,
which
caused
klaus
to
steadily
weaken
.


After
deteriorating
into
a
tropical
depression
,
Klaus
briefly
restrengthened
over
the
Bahamas
before
dissipating
on
October
9
under
the
influence
of
developing
tropical
storm
,
Marco
.


Heavy
rainfall
on
Saint
Lucia
destroyed
about
15
%
of
its
yearly
banana
crop
.


Damage
was
heaviest
on
Martinique
,
where
seven
casualties
occurred
and
1,500
people
were
left
homeless
as
the
heavy
rainfall
caused
severe
flooding
on
the
island
,
resulting
in
some
landslides
.


the
remnant
moisture
of
klaus
entered
the
southeastern
united
states
,
dropping
heavy
rainfall
and
causing
four
casualties
;
the
same
area
was
affected
with
more
precipitation
a
few
days
later
by
tropical
storm
marco
.


Due
to
the
damage
caused
by
the
storm
,
the
name
Klaus
was
retired
from
the
list
of
tropical
cyclone
names
.


The
Battle
of
Stow-on-the-Wold
(
21
March
1646
)
took
place
during
the
First
English
Civil
War
.


It
was
a
Parliamentarian
victory
by
detachments
of
the
New
Model
Army
over
the
last
Royalist
field
army
.


In
the
spring
of
1646
,
King
Charles
I
of
England
was
getting
ever
more
desperate
to
hold
the
Royalist
cause
together
whilst
waiting
for
the
long
promised
relief
forces
from
Ireland
,
Scotland
and
France
.


Sir
Jacob
Astley
took
command
of
the
Royalist
forces
in
the
west
and
began
to
gather
up
the
remnants
from
the
handful
of
Royalist
garrisons
still
left
in
the
West
Midlands
to
create
a
new
field
army
.


at
this
point
in
the
war
,
royalist
morale
was
low
.


However
,
Astley
,
a
stalwart
of
the
Royalist
commanders
and
an
experienced
soldier
,
was
able
to
cobble
together
a
force
of
3,000
.


While
returning
to
Oxford
he
was
intercepted
and
defeated
at
Stow-on-the-Wold
.


The
Siege
of
Genoa
took
place
in
1747
when
an
Austrian
army
under
the
command
of
Count
Schulenberg
launched
a
failed
attempt
to
capture
the
capital
of
the
Republic
of
Genoa
.


The
Austrians
had
captured
and
then
lost
Genoa
the
previous
year
and
made
it
the
central
objective
of
their
strategy
for
1747
before
they
would
consider
further
operations
against
Naples
or
an
invasion
of
France
.


Schulenberg
's
force
reached
the
outskirts
of
the
city
in
April
,
but
realising
they
needed
more
troops
they
waited
until
twelve
battalions
of
infantry
from
their
Sardinian
allies
arrived
in
June
.


The
delay
allowed
the
French
and
Spanish
to
send
reinforcements
to
the
city
under
Joseph
Marie
,
Duke
of
Boufflers
to
bolster
the
garrison
.


The
approach
of
a
Franco-Spanish
force
under
Marshal
Belle-Isle
and
General
Las
Minas
pressured
the
Sardinians
to
withdraw
to
try
to
defend
a
possible
threat
to
Milan
,
and
Schulenberg
then
abandoned
the
siege
blaming
the
Sardinians
.


The
failed
siege
led
to
recriminations
between
Vienna
and
Turin
with
both
complaining
to
their
British
allies
in
London
about
the
alleged
betrayal
of
the
other
.


The
Apalachee
massacre
was
a
series
of
raids
by
English
colonists
from
the
Province
of
Carolina
and
their
Indian
allies
against
a
largely
peaceful
population
of
Apalachee
Indians
in
northern
Spanish
Florida
that
took
place
in
1704
,
during
Queen
Anne
's
War
.


Against
limited
Spanish
and
Indian
resistance
,
a
network
of
missions
was
destroyed
;
most
of
the
population
either
was
killed
or
captured
,
fled
to
larger
Spanish
and
French
outposts
,
or
voluntarily
joined
the
English
.


The
only
major
event
of
former
Carolina
Governor
James
Moore
's
expedition
was
the
Battle
of
Ayubale
,
which
marked
the
only
large-scale
resistance
to
the
English
raids
.


Significant
numbers
of
the
Apalachee
,
unhappy
with
the
conditions
they
lived
in
under
the
Spanish
,
simply
abandoned
their
towns
and
joined
Moore
's
expedition
.


They
were
resettled
near
the
Savannah
and
Ocmulgee
Rivers
,
where
conditions
were
only
slightly
better
.


Moore
's
raiding
expedition
was
preceded
and
followed
by
other
raiding
activity
that
was
principally
conducted
by
English-allied
Creeks
.


The
cumulative
effect
of
these
raids
,
conducted
between
1702
and
1709
,
was
to
depopulate
Spanish
Florida
beyond
the
immediate
confines
of
Saint
Augustine
and
Pensacola
.


Hurricane
Gert
was
the
fourth
of
five
major
hurricanes
in
the
moderately
active
1999
Atlantic
hurricane
season
.


a
cape
verde
tropical
cyclone
,
gert
formed
on
september
11
off
the
coast
of
africa
before
heading
west-northwest
.


It
reached
a
peak
wind
speed
of
150
mph
(
240
km/h
)
by
September
15
over
the
open
central
Atlantic
east-northeast
of
the
Leeward
Islands
.


It
gradually
curved
to
the
northwest
and
later
to
the
north
,
due
to
a
weakness
in
the
subtropical
ridge
created
by
Hurricane
Floyd
.


Hurricane
Gert
passed
east
of
Bermuda
on
September
21
and
began
a
steady
weakening
trend
at
that
time
.


It
turned
to
the
northeast
,
and
on
September
23
,
Gert
transitioned
into
an
extratropical
cyclone
to
the
southeast
of
Atlantic
Canada
before
being
absorbed
by
a
larger
storm
.


For
several
days
,
Gert
threatened
to
strike
Bermuda
,
prompting
the
evacuation
of
tourists
.


although
gert
's
center
did
not
make
landfall
,
it
passed
a
short
distance
east
of
the
island
,
producing
hurricane-force
winds
that
left
11,000
people
without
power
.


High
waves
swept
two
people
out
to
sea
at
Acadia
National
Park
in
Maine
.


Later
,
strong
waves
struck
Newfoundland
and
left
heavy
marine
damage
.


The
Battle
of
Palmito
Ranch
is
considered
by
some
criteria
as
the
final
battle
of
the
American
Civil
War
.


It
was
fought
May
12
and
13
,
1865
,
on
the
banks
of
the
Rio
Grande
east
of
Brownsville
,
Texas
and
a
few
miles
from
the

.


since
the
confederacy
had
ceased
to
exist
,
it
is
also
argued
that
this
battle
should
be
classified
as
a
postwar
action
.


Union
and
Confederate
forces
in
southern
Texas
had
been
observing
an
unofficial
truce
since
the
beginning
of
1865
.


But
Union
Colonel
Theodore
H.
Barrett
,
newly
assigned
to
command
an
all-black
unit
,
and
never
having
been
in
combat
,
ordered
an
attack
on
a
Confederate
camp
near
Fort
Brown
for
unknown
reasons
.


The
Union
attackers
captured
a
few
prisoners
,
but
the
following
day
the
attack
was
repulsed
near
Palmito
Ranch
by
Colonel
John
Salmon
Ford
,
and
the
battle
resulted
in
a
Union
defeat
.


Union
forces
were
surprised
by
artillery
,
said
to
have
been
supplied
by
the
French
Army
occupying
the
nearby
Mexican
town
of
Matamoros
.


Casualty
estimates
are
not
dependable
,
but
Union
Private
John
J.
Williams
of
the
34th
Indiana
Infantry
Regiment
is
believed
to
have
been
the
last
man
killed
in
this
engagement
.


He
could
then
arguably
be
reckoned
as
the
last
man
killed
in
the
war
.


The
engagement
is
also
known
as
The
Battle
of
Palmito
Hill
.


The
Battle
of
Bautzen
(
or
Battle
of
Budziszyn
,
April
1945
)
was
one
of
the
last
battles
of
the
Eastern
Front
during
World
War
II
.


It
was
fought
on
the
extreme
southern
flank
of
the
Spremberg-Torgau
Offensive
,
seeing
days
of
pitched
street
fighting
between
forces
of
the
Communist
Polish
Second
Army
under
elements
of
the
Soviet
52nd
Army
and
5th
Guards
Army
on
one
side
and
elements
of
German
Army
Group
Center
in
the
form
of
the
remnants
of
the
4th
Panzer
and
17th
armies
on
the
other
.


The
battle
took
place
during
Ivan
Konev
's
1st
Ukrainian
Front
's
push
toward
Berlin
,
which
was
part
of
the
larger
Soviet
Berlin
Offensive
.


The
battle
was
fought
in
the
town
of
Bautzen
(
)
and
the
rural
areas
to
the
northeast
situated
primarily
along
the
Bautzen–Niesky
line
.


Major
combat
began
on
21
April
1945
and
continued
until
26
April
although
isolated
engagements
continued
to
take
place
until
30
April
.


The
Polish
Second
Army
under
Karol
Świerczewski
suffered
heavy
losses
,
but
,
with
the
aid
of
Soviet
reinforcements
,
prevented
the
German
forces
from
breaking
through
to
their
rear
.


After
the
battle
both
sides
claimed
victory
and
modern
views
as
to
who
won
the
battle
remain
contradictory
.


Because
the
war
was
almost
over
and
the
battle
had
no
strategic
impact
on
the
ongoing
Battle
of
Berlin
,
German
historiography
has
focused
more
on
its
tactical
aspects
.


The
German
operation
successfully
recaptured
Bautzen
and
its
surroundings
,
which
were
held
until
the
end
of
the
war
.


Operation
Pamphlet
,
also
called
Convoy
Pamphlet
,
was
a
World
War
II
convoy
operation
conducted
during
January
and
February
1943
to
transport
the
9th
Australian
Division
home
from
Egypt
.


The
convoy
involved
five
transports
,
which
were
protected
from
Japanese
warships
by
several
Allied
naval
task
forces
during
the
trip
across
the
Indian
Ocean
and
along
the
Australian
coast
.


The
division
embarked
in
late
January
1943
and
the
convoy
operation
began
on
4
February
.


No
contact
was
made
between
Allied
and
Japanese
ships
,
and
the
division
arrived
in
Australian
ports
during
late
February
with
no
losses
from
enemy
action
.


The
operation
came
after
the
British
and
United
States
governments
agreed
to
an
Australian
government
request
that
the
9th
Division
be
returned
home
,
and
ended
the
role
of
the
Second
Australian
Imperial
Force
in
the
Western
Desert
Campaign
.


This
followed
a
lengthy
debate
between
the
respective
national
leaders
,
with
Winston
Churchill
and
Franklin
D.
Roosevelt
attempting
to
convince
the
Australian
Prime
Minister
John
Curtin
to
withdraw
his
request
until
the
Allied
victory
in
North
Africa
was
complete
.


Curtin
was
unwilling
to
delay
,
as
he
and
the
Allied
military
leaders
in
the
South
West
Pacific
believed
that
the
veteran
division
was
needed
to
bolster
the
forces
for
offensive
operations
in
New
Guinea
.


A
convoy
to
return
the
9th
Australian
Division
to
Australia
was
assembled
in
the
Red
Sea
near
Massawa
from
late
January
to
early
February
1943
.


The
ships
began
their
voyage
across
the
Indian
Ocean
on
4
February
,
refuelled
at
Addu
Atoll
,
and
arrived
safely
at
the
Western
Australian
port
of
Fremantle
on
18
February
.


Four
transports
continued
to
the
Australian
east
coast
,
one
docking
at
Melbourne
on
25
February
and
the
remainder
arriving
at
Sydney
two
days
later
.


After
its
return
to
Australia
,
the
division
made
an
important
contribution
to
operations
in
New
Guinea
in
late
1943
.


The
British
Asian
Cup
was
a
day/night
Twenty20
cricket
charity
match
played
between
the
2008
Indian
Premier
League
(
IPL
)
champion
Rajasthan
Royals
and
the
2008
Twenty20
Cup
champion
Middlesex
Panthers
played
at
the
Lord
's
Cricket
Ground
,
London
,
England
.


A
portion
of
the
earnings
of
the
match
went
to
the
British
Asian
Trust
.


It
ended
as
the
Royals
defeated
the
Panthers
by
46
runs
.


Shaun
Udal
and
Shane
Warne
were
the
captains
for
the
Panthers
and
the
Royals
respectively
.


The
Royals
played
a
warm-up
game
with
the
Middlesex
Second
XI
before
the
match
,
and
won
it
by
28
runs
.


The
match
attracted
a
crowd
of
20,000
people
,
but
was
delayed
due
to
rain
.


Winning
the
toss
,
the
Panthers
opted
to
bowl
first
.


The
Royals
scored
162
runs
for
five
wickets
,
and
Swapnil
Asnodkar
and
Mohammad
Kaif
top-scored
with
41
run
each
.


Dawid
Malan
took
two
wickets
for
23
runs
.


In
reply
,
the
Panthers
made
116
runs
for
seven
wickets
,
as
the
Royals
won
by
46
runs
.


Sohail
Tanvir
took
three
wickets
for
20
runs
,
and
Dimitri
Mascarenhas
was
named
the
man
of
the
match
for
his
all-round
performance
.


The
2008–09
Australian
bushfire
season
was
the
Australian
bushfire
season
that
ran
from
late
December
2008
to
April/May
2009
.


Above
average
rainfalls
in
December
,
particularly
in
Victoria
,
delayed
the
start
of
the
season
,
but
by
January
2009
,
conditions
throughout
South
eastern
Australia
worsened
with
the
onset
of
one
of
the
region
's
worst
heat
waves
.


On
7
February
,
extreme
bushfire
conditions
precipitated
major
bushfires
throughout
Victoria
,
involving
several
large
fire
complexes
,
which
continued
to
burn
across
the
state
for
around
one
month
.


173
people
lost
their
lives
in
these
fires
and
414
were
injured
.


3,500+
buildings
were
destroyed
,
including
2,029
houses
,
and
7,562
people
displaced
.


Late
2008
had
relatively
few
bushfires
.


Victoria
in
particular
experienced
higher
than
average
rainfall
in
December
,
decreasing
the
fire
danger
in
many
regions
of
the
state
.


Initial
observations
in
October
2008
predicted
an
above
average
fire
potential
across
Australia
's
coastal
regions
and
a
below
average
potential
in
Central
Australia
,
where
drought
has
reduced
the
available
fuel
.


In
late
January
and
early
February
,
the
effects
of
the
2009
southeastern
Australia
heat
wave
increased
temperatures
across
south-eastern
Australia
,
particularly
in
Victoria
and
South
Australia
,
where
several
locations
broke
all
time
temperature
records
.


Various
days
of
high
wind
speed
,
combined
with
the
hot
dry
conditions
,
created
extreme
bushfire
conditions
between
25
January
and
7
February
2009
.


the
battle
of
malta
took
place
on
8
july
1283
in
the
entrance
to
the
grand
harbour
,
the
principal
harbour
of
malta
,
as
part
of
the
war
of
the
sicilian
vespers
.


An
Aragonese
fleet
of
galleys
,
commanded
by
Roger
of
Lauria
,
attacked
and
defeated
a
fleet
of
Angevin
galleys
commanded
by
Guillaume
Cornut
and
Bartholomé
Bonvin
.


The
Angevin
ships
arrived
in
Malta
first
,
and
proceeded
to
relieve
the
Angevin
garrison
,
which
was
besieged
within
the
walls
of
the
``
Castello
del
Mare
''
.


The
galleys
were
followed
in
close
pursuit
by
an
Aragonese
fleet
.


Roger
of
Lauria
easily
out-maneuvered
the
Angevin-Provençal
fleet
,
and
destroyed
almost
all
of
Cornut
and
Bonvin
's
vessels
.


Lauria
then
sailed
back
northwards
,
making
a
demonstration
off
Naples
,
raided
the
neighbouring
coast
,
attacked
and
then
garrisoned
Capri
and
Ischia
.


The
crushing
defeat
forced
Charles
I
of
Naples
to
postpone
his
plan
to
invade
Sicily
.


A
series
of
flash
floods
hit
different
areas
of
Thailand
and
Malaysia
in
2010
.


Separate
but
related
floods
began
in
the
Northeast
and
Central
Thailand
(
per
the
six-region
definition
)
in
early
October
due
to
abnormally
late
monsoon
moisture
over
the
Bay
of
Bengal
,
overflowed
the
Chao
Phraya
where
the
rivers
meet
,
and
affected
Bangkok
,
and
in
the
South
were
triggered
by
a
tropical
depression
about
two
weeks
later
,
and
was
later
aggravated
by
related
``
La
Niña
''
monsoon
rains
.


Floods
subsequently
occurred
in
the
Malaysian
states
of
Kedah
and
Perlis
in
November
2010
.


although
flooding
is
a
common
and
annual
occurrence
in
this
part
of
the
world
,
a
combination
of
inadequate
drainage
and
higher
than
average
rainfall
in
the
month
of
october
and
november
2010
which
caught
the
nation
off
guard
and
led
to
disaster
.


The
death
toll
in
Thailand
stands
at
232
people
.


According
to
the
Thai
government
data
the
floods
affected
nearly
7
million
people
in
more
than
25,000
villages
,
mostly
by
destruction
of
property
,
livelihood
and
infrastructure
.


The
government
announced
that
38
provinces
were
hit
by
floods
from
1
October
until
13
November
,
and
waters
had
receded
in
eight
provinces
,
leaving
30
provinces
still
affected
,
including
12
in
the
southern
region
of
the
country
.


The
``
Havørn
''
Accident
(
)
was
a
controlled
flight
into
terrain
of
a
Junkers
Ju
52
aircraft
into
the
mountain
Lihesten
in
Hyllestad
,
Norway
on
16
June
1936
at
07:00
.


the
aircraft
,
operated
by
norwegian
air
lines
,
was
en
route
from
bergen
to
UNK
.


The
pilots
were
unaware
that
they
were
flying
a
parallel
to
the
planned
course
,
further
east
.


The
crew
of
four
and
three
passengers
were
all
killed
in
what
was
the
first
fatal
aviation
accident
in
Norway
.


The
aircraft
landed
on
a
shelf
on
the
mountain
face
.


A
first
expedition
found
four
bodies
,
but
attempts
to
reach
the
shelf
with
the
main
part
of
the
aircraft
and
three
more
bodies
failed
.


A
second
party
was
sent
out
two
days
later
,
coordinated
by
Bernt
Balchen
and
led
by
Boye
Schlytter
and
Henning
Tønsberg

the
kyrgyz
revolution
of
2010
,
also
known
as
the
second
kyrgyz
revolution
,
the
melon
revolution
,
the
april
events
(
``
unk

''
)
or
officially
as
the
people
's
april
revolution
,
began
in
april
2010
with
the
ousting
of
kyrgyz
president
kurmanbek
bakiyev
in
the
capital
bishkek
.


It
was
followed
by
increased
ethnic
tension
involving
Kyrgyz
people
and
Uzbeks
in
the
south
of
the
country
,
which
escalated
in
June
2010
.


The
violence
ultimately
led
to
the
consolidation
of
a
new
parliamentary
system
in
Kyrgyzstan
.


During
the
general
mayhem
,
exiles
from
the
Uzbek
minority
claim
they
were
assaulted
and
driven
to
Uzbekistan
,
with
some
400,000
Kyrgyzstani
citizens
becoming
internally
displaced
.


Victims
interviewed
by
media
and
aid
workers
testify
to
mass
killing
,
gang

Then-head
of
the
Interim
government
Roza
Otunbayeva
indicated
that
the
death
toll
is
tenfold
higher

,
which
brings
the
number
of
the
dead
to
2,000
people
.


The
1967
Detroit
riot
,
also
known
as
the
1967
Detroit
Rebellion
or
12th
Street
riot
was
the
bloodiest
incident
in
the
``
Long
,
hot
summer
of
1967
''
.


Composed
mainly
of
confrontations
between
black
residents
and
the
Detroit
Police
Department
,
it
began
in
the
early
morning
hours
of
Sunday
July
23
,
1967
,
in
Detroit
,
Michigan
.


The
precipitating
event
was
a
police
raid
of
an
unlicensed
,
after-hours
bar
then
known
as
a
``
blind
pig
,
''
on
the
city
's
Near
West
Side
.


It
exploded
into
one
of
the
deadliest
and
most
destructive
riots
in
American
history
,
lasting
five
days
and
surpassing
the
violence
and
property
destruction
of
Detroit
's
1943
race
riot
24
years
earlier
.


To
help
end
the
disturbance
,
Governor
George
W.
Romney
ordered
the
Michigan
Army
National
Guard
into
Detroit
,
and
President
Lyndon
B.
Johnson
sent
in
the
United
States
Army
's
82nd
and
101st
Airborne
Divisions
.


The
result
was
43
dead
,
1,189
injured
,
over
7,200
arrests
,
and
more
than
2,000
buildings
destroyed
.


The
scale
of
the
riot
was
the
worst
in
the
United
States
since
the
1863
New
York
City
draft
riots
during
the
American
Civil
War
,
and
was
not
surpassed
until
the
1992
Los
Angeles
riots
25
years
later
.


The
riot
was
prominently
featured
in
the
news
media
,
with
live
television
coverage
,
extensive
newspaper
reporting
,
and
extensive
stories
in

The
Pakrac
clash
,
known
in
Croatia
as
the
Battle
of
Pakrac
(
)
,
was
a
bloodless
skirmish
that
took
place
in
the
Croatian
town
of
Pakrac
in
March
1991
.


The
clash
was
a
result
of
increasing
ethnic
tensions
in
Croatia
during
the
breakup
of
Yugoslavia
.


It
was
one
of
the
first
serious
outbreaks
of
violence
in
what
became
the
Croatian
War
of
Independence
.


The
clash
began
after
rebel
Serbs
seized
the
town
's
police
station
and
municipal
building
and
harassed
Croatian
government
officials
.


The
Croatian
government
carried
out
a
counterstrike
against
the
rebels
,
sending
Interior
Ministry
special
police
to
re-establish
control
.


Fighting
broke
out
between
the
two
sides
.


Despite
an
attempted
intervention
by
the
Yugoslav
National
Army
(
``
Jugoslovenska
Narodna
Armija
''
–
JNA
)
,
the
Croatian
government
reasserted
its
control
over
the
town
.


After
a
standoff
with
the
JNA
,
an
agreement
to
pull
out
the
special
police
and
the
JNA
was
reached
,
restoring
the
town
to
conditions
before
the
Serb
attempt
to
seize
control
of
the
police
there
.


Brutal
Assault
is
an
open-air
extreme
metal
festival
that
takes
place
in
the
18th-century
army
fortress
Josefov
,
located
in
Jaroměř
,
Czech
Republic
.


It
is
held
each
August
early
in
the
month
from
Wednesday
until
Saturday
.


The
festival
started
in
1996
,
originally
focused
on
grindcore
.


For
many
years
,
it
was
a
small
event
with
mainly
Czech
and
Slovak
bands
performing
.


It
changed
location
several
times
and
grew
into
a
large
event
by
2006
,
when
over
7,000
people
attended
the
festival
in
Svojšice
.


After
moving
to
Josefov
,
attendances
grew
further
to
15,000
in
2012
and
the
festival
has
operated
two
alternating
main
stages
since
.


Currently

the
february
revolution
(

tr
.


)
,
known
in
Soviet
historiography
as
the
February
Bourgeois
Democratic
Revolution
and
sometimes
as
the
March
Revolution
,
was
the
first
of
two
revolutions
which
took
place
in
Russia
in
1917
.


The
main
events
of
the
revolution
took
place
in
and
near
Petrograd
(
present-day
Saint
Petersburg
)
,
the
then-capital
of
Russia
,
where
long-standing
discontent
with
the
monarchy
erupted
into
mass
protests
against
food
rationing
on
23
February
Old
Style
(
8
March
New
Style
)
.


Revolutionary
activity
lasted
about
eight
days
,
involving
mass
demonstrations
and
violent
armed
clashes
with
police
and
gendarmes
,
the
last
loyal
forces
of
the
Russian
monarchy
.


On
27
February
O.S
.


(
12
March
N.S
.
)


mutinous
Russian
Army
forces
sided
with
the
revolutionaries
.


Three
days
later
Tsar
Nicholas
II
abdicated
,
ending
Romanov
dynastic
rule
and
the
Russian
Empire
.


A
Russian
Provisional
Government
under
Prince
Georgy
Lvov
replaced
the
Council
of
Ministers
of
Russia
.


The
revolution
appeared
to
break
out
without
any
real
leadership
or
formal
planning
.


Russia
had
been
suffering
from
a
number
of
economic
and
social
problems
,
which
compounded
after
the
start
of
World
War
I
in
1914
.


Disaffected
soldiers
from
the
city
's
garrison
joined
bread
rioters
,
primarily
women
in
bread
lines
,
and
industrial
strikers
on
the
streets
.


As
more
and
more
troops
deserted
,
and
with
loyal
troops
away
at
the
Front
,
the
city
fell
into
chaos
,
leading
to
the
overthrow
of
the
Tsar
.


In
all
,
over
1,300
people
were
killed
during
the
protests
of
February
1917
.


The
Nellie
massacre
took
place
in
central
Assam
during
a
six-hour
period
in
the
morning
of
18
February
1983
.


The
massacre
claimed
the
lives
of
2,191
people
(
unofficial
figures
run
at
more
than
10,000
)
from
14
villages—Alisingha

The
victims
were
Bengal
rooted
Muslims
whose
ancestors
had
relocated
in
pre-partition
British
India
.


Three
media
personnel
—
Hemendra
Narayan
of
Indian
Express
,
Bedabrata
Lahkar
of
Assam
Tribune
and
Sharma
of
ABC
—
were
witnesses
to
the
massacre
.


The
victims
were
descendants
of
Muslims
who
came
to
Assam
on
the
direct
patronage
of
the
then
Assam
Government
of
British
India
in
the
first
decade
of
the
20th
century
.


The
violence
that
took
place
in
Nellie
was
seen
as
a
fallout
of
the
decision
to
hold
the
controversial
state
elections
in
1983
in
the
midst
of
the
Assam
Agitation
,
after
Indira
Gandhi
's
decision
to
give
4
million
immigrants
from
Bangladesh
the
right
to
vote
.


It
has
been
described
as
one
of
the
worst
pogroms
since
World
War
II

The
2010
South

)
were
clashes
between
ethnic
Kyrgyz
and
Uzbeks
in
southern
Kyrgyzstan
,
primarily
in
the
cities
of
Osh
and
Jalal-Abad
,
in

.


it
is
part
of
the
larger
kyrgyz
revolution
of
2010
.


Violence
that
started
between
Kyrgyz
and
Uzbeks
on
19
May
in
Jalal-Abad
escalated
on
10
June
in
Osh
.


The
spreading
of
the
violence
required
the
Russian-endorsed
interim
government
led
by
Roza
Otunbayeva
to
declare
a
state
of
emergency
on
12
June
,
in
an
attempt
to
take
control
of
the
situation
.


Uzbekistan
launched
a
limited
troop
incursion
early
on
,
but
withdrew
and
opened
its
borders
to
Uzbek
refugees
.


The
clashes
killed
nearly
420
people
,
mostly
Uzbeks
,
and
displaced
another
80,000
.


Typhoon
Nepartak
,
known
in
the
Philippines
as
Typhoon
Weng
,
was
a
modest
tropical
cyclone
that
struck
the
central
Philippines
and
the
southern
China
island
of
Hainan
in
November
2003
.


Forming
as
a
tropical
depression
on
November
11
between
Yap
and
Guam
,
the
system
moved
westward
and
slowly
intensified
.


It
received
the
name
Nepartak
midday
on
November
12
from
the
Japan
Meteorological
Agency
,
becoming
the
20th
named
storm
of
the
2003
Pacific
typhoon
season
.


On
November
13
,
Napartak
struck
Samar
in
the
Philippines
and
bisected
the
island
chain
.


Up
to
four
million
people
lost
power
,
and
transportation
ground
to
a
halt
;
over
5,000
individuals
became
stranded
on
ships
forced
to
stay
in
port
during
the
tropical
storm
.


It
was
reported
that
13
individuals
lost
their
lives
to
the
storm
in
the
Philippines
.


After
entering
the
open
waters
of
the
South
China
Sea
,
Nepartak
continued
to
intensify
and
turned
more
toward
the
northwest
.


It
attained
its
peak
intensity
on
November
16
,
with
maximum
10‑minute
sustained
winds
of
120
km/h
(
75
mph
)
and
1-minute
winds
of
140
km/h
(
85
mph
)
.


After
weakening
slightly
,
the
storm
found
a
weakness
in
the
easterly
steering
currents
and
bore
north
,
reintensifying
slightly
and
directly
striking
southwestern
Hainan
.


There
,
heavy
rainfall
and
strong
winds
destroyed
crops
,
livestock
,
and
hundreds
of
homes
,
leaving
$
197
million
(
2003
USD
)
in
damage
.


The
storm
rapidly
deteriorated
in
the
Gulf
of
Tonkin
and
dissipated
as
it
neared
mainland
China
.


The
Great
Northern
War
(
1700–1721
)
was
a
conflict
in
which
a
coalition
led
by
the
Tsardom
of
Russia
successfully
contested
the
supremacy
of
the
Swedish
Empire
in
Northern
,
Central
and
Eastern
Europe
.


The
initial
leaders
of
the
anti-Swedish
alliance
were
Peter
I
of
Russia
,
Frederick
IV
of
Denmark–Norway
and
Augustus
II
the
Strong
of
Saxony–Poland–Lithuania
.


Frederick
IV
and
Augustus
II
were
defeated
by
Sweden
,
under
Charles
XII
,
and
forced
out
of
the
alliance
in
1700
and
1706
respectively
,
but
rejoined
it
in
1709
after
the
defeat
of
Charles
XII
at
the
Battle
of
Poltava
.


George
I
of
Great
Britain
and
of
Brunswick-Lüneburg
(
Hanover
)
joined
the
coalition
in
1714
for
Hanover
and
in
1717
for
Britain
,
and
Frederick
William
I
of
Brandenburg-Prussia
joined
it
in
1715
.


Charles
XII
led
the
Swedish
army
.


Swedish
allies
included
Holstein-Gottorp
,
several
Polish
magnates
under
Stanisław
I
Leszczyński
(
1704–1710
)
and
Cossacks
under
the
Ukrainian
Hetman
Ivan
Mazepa
(
1708–1710
)
.


The
Ottoman
Empire
temporarily
hosted
Charles
XII
of
Sweden
and
intervened
against
Peter
I
.


The
war
began
when
an
alliance
of
Denmark–Norway
,
Saxony
,
Poland
and
Russia
,
sensing
an
opportunity
as
Sweden
was
ruled
by
the
young
Charles
XII
,
declared
war
on
the
Swedish
Empire
and
launched
a
threefold
attack
on
Swedish
Holstein-Gottorp
,
Swedish
Livonia
,
and
Swedish
Ingria
.


sweden
parried
the
danish
and
russian
attacks
at
unk
(
august
1700
)
and
narva
(
november
1700
)
respectively
,
and
in
a
counter-offensive
pushed
augustus
ii
's
forces
through
the
unk
commonwealth
to
saxony
,
dethroning
augustus
on
the
way
(
september
1706
)
and
forcing
him
to
acknowledge
defeat
in
the
treaty
of
unk
(
october
1706
)
.


The
treaty
also
secured
the
extradition
and
execution
of
Johann
Reinhold
Patkul
,
architect
of
the
alliance
seven
years
earlier
.


Meanwhile
,
the
forces
of
Peter
I
had
recovered
from
defeat
at
Narva
and
gained
ground
in
Sweden
's
Baltic
provinces
,
where
they
cemented
Russian
access
to
the
Baltic
Sea
by
founding
Saint
Petersburg
in
1703
.


Charles
XII
moved
from
Saxony
into
Russia
to
confront
Peter
,
but
the
campaign
ended
in
1709
with
the
destruction
of
the
main
Swedish
army
at
the
decisive
Battle
of
Poltava
(
in
present-day
Ukraine
)
and
Charles
'
exile
in
the
Ottoman
town
of
Bender
.


The
Ottoman
Empire
defeated
the
Russian-Moldavian
army
in
the
Pruth
River
Campaign
,
but
that
peace
treaty
was
in
the
end
without
great
consequence
to
Russia
's
position
.


After
Poltava
,
the
anti-Swedish
coalition
revived
and
subsequently
Hanover
and
Prussia
joined
it
.


The
remaining
Swedish
forces
in
plague-stricken
areas
south
and
east
of
the
Baltic
Sea
were
evicted
,
with
the
last
city
,
Riga
,
falling
in
1710
.


The
coalition
members
partitioned
most
of
the
Swedish
dominions
among
themselves
,
destroying
the
Swedish
``
dominium
maris
baltici
''
.


Sweden
proper
was
invaded
from
the
west
by
Denmark–Norway
and
from
the
east
by
Russia
,
which
had
occupied
Finland
by
1714
.


Sweden
defeated
the
Danish
invaders
at
the
Battle
of
Helsingborg
(
1710
)
.


Charles
XII
opened
up
a
Norwegian
front
but
was
killed
in
Fredriksten
in
1718
.


The
war
ended
with
the
defeat
of
Sweden
,
leaving
Russia
as
the
new
dominant
power
in
the
Baltic
region
and
as
a
new
major
force
in
European
politics
.


The
Western
powers
,
Great
Britain
and
France
,
became
caught
up
in
the
separate
War
of
the
Spanish
Succession
(
1702–1715
)
,
which
broke
out
over
the
Bourbon
Philip
of
Anjou
's
succession
to
the
Spanish
throne
and
a
possible
joining
of
France
and
Spain
.


the
formal
conclusion
of
the
great
northern
war
came
with
the
unk
and
unk
treaties
of
stockholm
(
1719
)
,
the
dano-swedish
treaty
of
frederiksborg
(
1720
)
,
and
the
russo-swedish
treaty
of
nystad
(
1721
)
.


By
these
treaties
Sweden
ceded
her
exemption
from
the
Sound
Dues
and
lost
the
Baltic
provinces
and
the
southern
part
of
Swedish
Pomerania
.


The
peace
treaties
also
ended
her
alliance
with
Holstein-Gottorp
.


Hanover
gained
Bremen-Verden
,
Brandenburg-Prussia
incorporated
the
Oder
estuary
(
Stettin
Lagoons
)
,
Russia
secured
the
Baltic
Provinces
,
and
Denmark
strengthened
her
position
in
Schleswig-Holstein
.


in
sweden
,
the
absolute
monarchy
had
come
to
an
end
with
the
death
of
charles

Hammerfest
is
a
music
festival
held
annually
in
North
Wales
.


From
2013
,
Hammerfest
has
moved
to
the
Haven
site
in
Pwllheli
,
Hafan
y
Môr
Holiday
Park
as
the
festival
has
outgrown
its
original
site
at
Pontin
's
Holiday
Village
,
Prestatyn
,
Wales
.


It
is
not
related
to
a
music
festival
of
the
same
name
hosted
by
white
supremacist
groups
.


The
festival
is
owned
by
emc3i
Ltd
,
sponsored
by
their
music
magazine
Metal
Hammer
and
run
by
the
organizers
of
the
Hard

Hell
festival
.


Because
the
festival
is
held
at
a
holiday
camp
,
the
organizers
can
make
use
of
pre-built
venues
and
stages
,
and
attendees
can
stay
in
the
on-site
accommodation
.


This
enables
the
festival
to
be
held
during
the
winter/spring
months
when
outdoor
camping
is
not
desirable
.

dropped
heavy
rainfall

the
cyclone
damaged

23,000
people
homeless

to
rise
in
Mozambique
several
days
after
the
storm
's
passage
.


There
were
17
deaths
in
Mozambique
.

rainfall
destroyed
a
bridge
and
several
houses
in
Zimbabwe
,
killing
eight
people
.

Troude
's
expedition
to
the
Caribbean
was
a
naval
operation
by
a
French
force
under
Commodore
Amable-Gilles
Troude
during
the
Napoleonic
Wars
.


The
French
squadron
departed
from
Lorient
in
February
1809
in
an
attempt
to
reach
and
resupply
the
island
colony
of
Martinique
in
the
Caribbean
Sea
,
then
under
invasion
from
a
British
expeditionary
force
.


The
force
arrived
much
too
late
to
affect
the
outcome
of
the
successful
invasion
and
took
shelter
from
a
British
squadron
in
the
Îles
des
Saintes
,
where
they
were
blockaded
by
part
of
the
British
invasion
fleet
,
led
by
Vice-Admiral
Sir
Alexander
Cochrane
.


Two
weeks
after
the
French
ships
arrived
,
British
troops
invaded
and
captured
the
Saintes
,
constructing
mortar
batteries
to
bombard
the
French
squadron
.


With
his
position
unsustainable
,
Commodore
Troude
decided
to
break
out
.


Attempting
to
escape
under
cover
of
darkness
on
14
April
,
the
French
squadron
was
spotted
by
a
number
of
small
British
ships
stationed
close
inshore
.


These
ships
raised
the
alarm
and
the
main
British
squadron
followed
in
pursuit
.


The
rearmost
French
ship
of
the
line
,
``
Hautpoult
''
,
was
closely
followed
by
the
small
brig
HMS
``
Recruit
''
,
which
succeeded
in
delaying
``
Hautpoult
''
long
enough
that
the
main
British
squadron
was
able
to
attack
and
overwhelm
her
in
a
running
battle
that
lasted
three
days
and
ended
off
the
coast
of
Puerto
Rico
.


The
British
suffered
45
casualties
,
the
French
nearly
100
.


The
remainder
of
the
French
squadron
escaped
,
with
the
two
surviving
ships
of
the
line
sailing
directly
for
France
,
eventually
reaching
Cherbourg
in
May
.


The
French
expedition
's
two
frigates
,
both
only
partially
armed
,
were
detached
during
the
action
and
took
shelter
in
harbour
at
Guadeloupe
.


In
June
,
heavily
laden
with
trade
goods
,
they
attempted
to
escape
to
Europe
,
but
were
pursued
by
elements
of
the
British
blockade
force
.


``
Félicité
''
was
overrun
after
four
days
of
manoeuvre
,
submitting
to
the
more
powerful
British
frigate
HMS
``
Latona
''
without
a
fight
.


``
Furieuse
''
was
able
to
escape
immediate
pursuit
,
but
was
subsequently
discovered
on
3
July
by
the
smaller
British
ship
HMS
``
Bonne
Citoyenne
''
.


In
a
fierce
engagement
two
days
later
,
the
small
British
ship
was
able
to
defeat
and
capture
the
French

,
which
was
later
commissioned
into
the
Royal
Navy
.


The
Battle
of
Palo
Alto
(
)
was
the
first
major
battle
of
the
Mexican–American
War
and
was
fought
on
May
8
,
1846
,
on
disputed
ground
five
miles
(
8
km
)
from
the
modern-day
city
of
Brownsville
,
Texas
.


A
force
of
some
3,700
Mexican
troops
–
most
of
the
``
Army
of
The
North
''
–
led
by
General
Mariano
Arista
engaged
a
force
of
approximately
2,300
United
States
troops
–
the
Army
of
Occupation
led
by
General
Zachary
Taylor
.


On
April
30
,
following
the
Thornton
Affair
,
Mexican
General
Mariano
Arista
's
troops
began
to
cross
the
Rio
Grande
.


On
May
3
,
the
troops
began
to
besiege
the
American
outpost
at
Fort
Texas
.


Taylor
marched
his
Army
of
Occupation
south
to
relieve
the
siege
.


Arista
,
upon
learning
of
his
approach
,
diverted
many
of
his
units
away
from
the
siege
to
meet
Taylor
's
force
.


The
battle
took
place
on
May
8
,
three
days
before
the
formal
declaration
of
war
on
Mexico
by
the
United
States
.


Arista
ordered
two
cavalry
charges
,
first
against
the
American
right
flank
and
later
against
the
left
.


Both
were
unsuccessful
.


The
American
victory
is
widely
attributed
to
superior
artillery
,
while
the
U.S.
``
light
''
artillery
was
much
more
mobile
and
accurate
than
that
of
the
Mexican
forces
.


That
evening
,
Arista
was
forced
to
withdraw
further
south
.


The
armies
clashed
again
the
next
day
at
the
Battle
of
Resaca
de
la
Palma
.


The
Siege
of
Prague
was
an
unsuccessful
attempt
by
a
Prussian
army
led
by
Frederick
the
Great
to
capture
the
Bohemian
city
of
Prague
during
the
Third
Silesian
War
(
Seven
Years
'
War
)
.


It
took
place
in
May
1757
immediately
after
the
Battle
of
Prague
.


Despite
having
won
that
battle
,
Frederick
had
lost
14,300
dead
,
and
his
severely
depleted
force
was
not
strong
enough
to
assault
Prague
.


Instead
Frederick
decided
to
besiege
the
city
,
hoping
to
force
it
into
submission
through
lack
of
supplies
.


40,000
Austrian
troops
were
trapped
in
the
city
,
though
they
were
themselves
not
strong
enough
to
consider
launching
a
sortie
.


Frederick
attempted
to
gain
intelligence
from
within
Prague
by
sending
the
criminal
Christian
Andreas
Käsebier
several
times
into
the
besieged
city
.


An
Austrian
army
led
by
the
Count
von
Daun
made
a
sudden
march
to
the
north
,
threatening
Frederick
's
lines
of
supply
,
and
he
was
forced
to
break
off
the
siege
and
march
to
attack
them
.


Frederick
was
defeated
at
the
Battle
of
Kolín
and
his
force
was
now
too
weak
to
contemplate
continuing
the
Siege
of
Prague
,
and
he
was
forced
to
withdraw
from
Bohemia
entirely
.


It
marked
a
high-water
mark
for
the
Prussians
,
as
they
would
never
hold
so
advantageous
a
position
again
and
most
of
the
remainder
of
the
war
would
be
fought
on
their
own
territory
.


In
spite
of
this
the
Prussians
attempted
another
invasion
of
Austrian
territory
the
following
year
which
culminated
in
a
failed
attempt
to
take
Olomouc
.


The
Raid
on
the
Medway
,
during
the
Second
Anglo-Dutch
War
in
June
1667
,
was
a
successful
attack
conducted
by
the
Dutch
navy
on
English
battleships
laid
up
in
the
fleet
anchorages
off
Chatham
Dockyard
and
Gillingham
in
the
county
of
Kent
.


at
the
time
,
the
fortress
of
upnor
castle
and
a
barrier
chain
called
the
``
gillingham
line
''
were
supposed
to
protect
the
english
ships
.


The
Dutch
,
under
nominal
command
of
Willem
Joseph
van
Ghent
and
Lieutenant-Admiral
Michiel
de
Ruyter
,
over
several
days
bombarded
and
captured
the
town
of
Sheerness
,
sailed
up
the
Thames
estuary
to
Gravesend
,
then
sailed
into
the
River
Medway
to
Chatham
and
Gillingham
,
where
they
engaged
fortifications
with
cannon
fire
,
burned
or
captured
three
capital
ships
and
ten
more
ships
of
the
line
,
and
captured
and
towed
away
the
flagship
of
the
English
fleet
,
.


Politically
,
the
raid
was
disastrous
for
King
Charles
'
war
plans
and
led
to
a
quick
end
to
the
war
and
a
favourable
peace
for
the
Dutch
.


It
was
one
of
the
worst
defeats
in
the
Royal
Navy
's
history
,
and
one
of
the
worst
suffered
by
the
British
military
.


Horace
George
Franks
called
it
the
``
most
serious
defeat
it
has
ever
had
in
its
home
waters
.
''


The
Ojo
de
Agua
Raid
was
the
last
important
military
engagement
between
Mexican
Seditionistas
and
the
United
States
Army
.


It
took
place
at
Ojo
de
Agua
,
Texas
.


As
part
of
the
Plan
of
San
Diego
,
the
rebels
launched
a
raid
across
the
Rio
Grande
into
Texas
on
October
21
,
1915
aimed
at
harassing
the
American
outposts
along
the
Mexican
border
and
disrupting
the
local
economy
.


After
moving
across
the
border
,
the
Seditionistas
began
an
assault
against
the
United
States
Army
Signal
Corps
station
at
Ojo
de
Agua
.


The
small
group
of
American
defenders
was
cornered
into
a
single
building
and
suffered
heavy
casualties
before
reinforcements
arrived
driving
the
Seditionist
force
back
into
Mexico
.


The
raid
proved
to
be
the
tipping
point
in
the
American
conflict
with
the
Seditionistas
,
as
its
severity
convinced
American
officials
to
send
large
numbers
of
American
troops
to
the
area
in
order
to
deter
any
further
serious
border
raids
by
the
Mexican
force
.


The
2003
Southeast
Asian
Games
,
officially
known
as
the
22nd
Southeast
Asian
Games
(
)
was
a
Southeast
Asian
multi-sport
event
held
in
Hanoi
,
Vietnam
.


This
was
the
first
time
in
history
Vietnam
hosted
the
Southeast
Asian
Games
and
the
first
time
East
Timor
participated
at
the
Southeast
Asian
Games
.


The
games
was
held
from
5
to
13
December
2003
although
several
events
had
commenced
from
29
November
2003
.


Around
5000
athletes
from
11
participating
nations
participated
at
the
games
,
which
featured
442
events
in
32
sports
.


Vietnam
is
the
seventh
nation
to
host
the
Southeast
Asian
Games
after
Thailand
,
Myanmar
,
Malaysia
,
Singapore
,
Indonesia
,
Philippines
and
Brunei
.


The
games
was
opened
by
Phan
Văn
Khải
,
the
Prime
Minister
of
Vietnam
at
the
newly
constructed
Mỹ
Đình
National
Stadium
and
was
closed
by
Pham
Gia
Khiem
,
the
Deputy
Prime
Minister
of
Vietnam
.


The
final
medal
tally
was
led
by
host
Vietnam
,
followed
by
Thailand
and
Indonesia
.


Several
Games
and
National
Records
were
broken
during
the
games
.


The
games
were
deemed
generally
successful
with
the
rising
standard
of
competition
amongst
the
Southeast
Asian
nations
.


The
Great
Raid
of
1840
was
the
largest
raid
ever
mounted
by
Native
Americans
on
white
cities
in
what
is
now
the
United
States
.


it
followed
the
council
house
fight
,
in
which
republic
of
texas
officials
attempted
to
capture
and
take
prisoner
33
comanche
chiefs
who
had
come
to
negotiate
a
peace
treaty
,
killing
them
together
with
two
dozen
of
their
family
and
followers
.


The
Comanche
tribe
was
supposed
to
have
brought
white
hostages
as
their
part
of
the
negotiations
but
only
brought
one
young
girl
.


Arguments
and
fighting
then
broke
out
among
the
Texians
and
Comanches
.


The
Texas
Officials
were
determined
to
force
the
Comanche
to
release
all
white
captives
among
them
.


To
avenge
what
the
Comanche
viewed
as
a
bitter
betrayal
by
the
Texans
,
the
Comanche
war
chief
Buffalo
Hump
raised
a
huge
war
party
of
many
of
the
bands
of
the
Comanche
,
and
raided
deep
into
white-settled
areas
of
Southeast
Texas
.


The
Capture
of
Montauban
(
``
Monty-Bong
''
to
the
British
)
,
took
place
on
1
July
1916
,
the
first
day
of
the
Battle
of
the
Somme
,
between
the
British
Fourth
Army
and
the
German
2nd
Army
,
on
the
Western
Front
,
during
the
First
World
War
.


Montauban
is
a
commune
in
the
Somme
department
in
Picardy
in
northern
France
and
lies
on
the
D
64
,
between
Guillemont
to
the
east
and
Mametz
to
the
west
.


To
the
north
are
Bazentin-le-Petit
and
Bazentin-le-Grand
.


Bernafay
and
Trônes
woods
are
to
the
north-east
and
Maricourt
lies
to
the
south
.


Military
operations
began
in
the
area
of
Montauban
in
late
September
1914
during
the
Race
to
the
Sea
,
when
the
II
Bavarian
Corps
and
later
the
XIV
Reserve
Corps
of
the
German
6th
Army
,
attacked
westwards
down
the
Somme
valley
,
to
reach
Albert
,
Amiens
and
the
sea
.


The
attack
was
stopped
just
east
of
Albert
by
the
French
Second
Army
,
which
then
attempted
a
reciprocal
outflanking
move
further
north
and
forced
the
6th
Army
to
fight
a
defensive
battle
,
as
more
troops
were
moved
further
north
to
attempt
another
advance
around
Arras
,
Lille
and
Lens
.


On
1
July
1916
,
the
German
first
defensive
position
ran
south
of
the
village
,
along
the
lower
slopes
of
Montauban
Spur
.


The
junction
of
the
British
Fourth
Army
and
XX
Corps
of
the
French
Sixth
Army
ran
through
Maricourt
and
to
the
east
of
Montauban
.


The
30th
Division
of
XIII
Corps
held
the
right
of
the
corps
area
,
next
to
the
French
39th
Division
,
which
formed
the
northernmost
division
of
the
Sixth
Army
.


Signs
of
an
offensive
by
the
British
and
French
had
been
seen
in
May
1916
but
German
military
intelligence
anticipated
an
offensive
against
the
Fricourt
and
Gommecourt
spurs
,
with
a
possible
supporting
attack
in
between
,
rather
than
an
attack
further
south
around
Montauban
and
the
Somme
river
.


The
30th
Division
attacked
behind
a
creeping
barrage
and
captured
its
objectives
of
Montauban
and
the
Montauban
Ridge
,
inflicting
many
casualties
on
Bavarian
Infantry
Regiment
6
,
of
the
10th
Bavarian
Division
and
Infantry
Regiment
62
of
the
12th
Division
.


A
German
counter-attack
in
the
early
hours
of
2
July
was
a
costly
failure
and
the
30th
Division
began
operations
against
Bernafay
and
Trônes
woods
on
3
July
.


Montauban
was
recaptured
by
German
troops
on
25
March
1918
during
Operation
Michael
,
as
the
right
flank
units
of
the
17th
(
Northern
)
Division
and
the
1st
Dismounted
Brigade
of
the
1st
Cavalry
Division
retreated
.


The
village
was
recaptured
for
the
last
time
six
months
later
on
26
August
,
by
the
18th
(
Eastern
)
Division
,
during
the
Second
Battle
of
Bapaume
.


Operation
Sea
Dragon
occurred
during
the
Vietnam
War
and
was
a
series
of
American-led
naval
operations
beginning
in
October
1966
to
interdict
sea
lines
of
communications
and
supply
going
south
from
North
Vietnam
to
South
Vietnam
,
and
to
destroy
land
targets
with
naval
gunfire
.


sea
dragon
assets
were
a
part
of
task
force
70.8
,
whose
mission
was
naval
shore
bombardment
.


The
U.S

Seventh
Fleet
destroyers
USS
``
Mansfield
''
(
DD-728
)
and
USS
``
Hanson
''
(
DD-832
)
commenced
operations
on
25
October
1966
off
the
coast
of
Quang
Tri
Province
to
intercept
and
destroy
waterborne
supply
craft
which
were
attempting
to
carry
supplies
and
personnel
from
North
Vietnam
to
areas
south
of
the
Demilitarized
Zone
(
DMZ
)
in
South
Vietnam
.


although
the
initial
sweep
by
the
two
destroyers
was
unproductive
,
by
february
1967
raids
had
been
conducted
as
far
as
230
miles
north
of
the
dmz
to
the
20th
parallel
.


at
the
height
of
the
operation
in
may
1967
2
cruisers
and
12
destroyers
were
assigned
sea
dragon
missions
.


Targets
included
radar
stations
,
boat
repair
facilities
,
bridges
,
and
surface-to-air
missile
sites
.


Seventh
Fleet
calculated
that
after
one
year
of
operations
that
Sea
Dragon
assets
had
sunk
or
damaged
2000
logistics
craft
.


During
the
operation
lifetime
there
were
29
Sea
Dragon
ships
damaged
by
shore
battery
fire
with
5
sailors
killed
and
26
wounded
.


In
April
1968
,
the
area
of
operations
was
reduced
to
that
below
the
19th
parallel
,
only
150
miles
north
of
the
DMZ
.


The
operation
ended
on
31
October
1968
when
Seventh
Fleet
assets
withdrew
to
south
of
the

Ditton
Junction
is
near
Widnes
on
the
Liverpool
spur
of
the
former

This
complex
junction
had
eight
running
lines
and
associated
signal
gantries
.


On
17
September
1912
the
17:30
Chester

Conwy
,
who
had
little
experience
of

misread
the

Blame
was
attributed
to
the

On
24
February
2015
,
a
mass
shooting
occurred
at
the
restaurant
in
the
town
of
Uherský
Brod
,
Czech
Republic
.


Nine
people
were
killed
,
including
the
gunman
,
63-year-old
Zdeněk
Kovář
,
who
committed
suicide
after
a
standoff
with
police
that
lasted
nearly
two
hours
.


In
addition
,
one
other
person
was
injured
.


Uherský
Brod
is
260
kilometers
(
160
miles
)
east-southeast
of
the
Czech
capital
Prague
.


The
shooting
was
one
of
the
two
deadliest
mass
murders
in
the
country
's
peacetime
history
,
alongside
a
1973
vehicular
rampage
committed
by
Olga
Hepnarová
.


The
circumstances
of
the
shooting
led
to
an
examination
on
the
gun
politics
in
the
Czech
Republic
and
police
rules
of
engagement
against
active
shooters
.


Czech
media
speculated
that
the
rampage
may
have
been
triggered
by
an
apparent
attempt
of
the
authorities
to
review
Kovář
's
mental
state
.


Lady
Be
Good
is
a
USAAF
B-24D
Liberator
that
disappeared
without
a
trace
on
its
first
combat
mission
during
World
War
II
.


The
plane
,
which
was
from
376th
Bomb
Group
,
was
believed
to
have
been
lost—with
its
nine-man
crew—in
the
Mediterranean
Sea
while
returning
to
its
base
in
Libya
following
a
bombing
raid
on
Naples
on
April
4
,
1943
.


However
,
the
wreck
was
accidentally
discovered
inland
in
the
Libyan
Desert
by
an
oil
exploration
team
from
British
Petroleum
on
November
9
,
1958
.


Investigations
concluded
that
the
first-time
(
all
new
)
crew
failed
to
realize
they
had
overflown
their
air
base
in
a
sandstorm
.


After
continuing
to
fly
south
into
the
desert
for
many
hours
,
the
crew
bailed
out
when
the
plane
's
fuel
ran
out
.


The
survivors
then
died
in
the
desert
trying
to
walk
to
safety
.


All
but
one
of
the
crew
's
remains
were
recovered
between
February
and
August
1960
.

was
an
Airbus
A310-300
on
a
scheduled
domestic
passenger
flight
,
flying
from
Moscow
Domodedovo
to
Irkutsk
,
when
it
crashed
upon

at
07:44
local
time
on
9
July
2006
(

)
.


The
plane
overshot
the
runway
,
sliding
over
several
hundred
metres
of
wet
runway
and
grass
.


It
crashed
through
a
concrete
barricade
,
hit
a
group
of

garages
and
burst
into
flames
.


Television
pictures
showed
smoking
ruins
of
the
Airbus
with
only
the
tail
section
intact
.


It
took
two
hours
for
local
firefighters
from
five
different
fire
stations
to
extinguish
the
blaze
.


A
total
of
125
people
were
killed
in
the
accident
.


it
was
the
deadliest
plane
crash
in
irkutsk
since
vladivostok
air
flight
352
in
2001
.


It
was
also
the
company
's
deadliest
plane
crash
.


Currently
,
it
is
held
as
the
fourth
deadliest
plane
crash
in
Russia
and
the
third
deadliest
involving
an
Airbus
A310
,
after
Kenya
Airways
Flight
431
and
Yemenia
Flight
626
.


In
the
wake
of
the
crash
,
most
media
outlets
reported
that
a
brake
failure
occurred
in
Flight
778
.


However
,
the
final
report
of
the
Russian
Interstate
Aviation
Committee
(
MAK
)
,
concluded
that
the
cause
of
the
crash
was
pilot
error
.


The
1925
Florida
tropical
storm
was
the
deadliest
tropical
cyclone
to
impact
the
United
States
that
did
not
become
a
hurricane
.


The
fourth
and
final
storm
of
the
season
,
it
formed
as
a
tropical
depression
on
November
27
near
the
Yucatán
Peninsula
,
the
system
initially
tracked
southeastward
before
turning
north
as
it
gradually
intensified
.


After
skirting
western
Cuba
on
November
30
,
the
storm
reached
peak
winds
of
before
striking
central
Florida
on
December
1
.


Within
hours
,
the
system
transitioned
into
an
extratropical
cyclone
and
emerged
into
the
Atlantic
Ocean
.


The
system
moved
onshore
once
more
on
December
2
in
North
Carolina
before
turning
east
,
away
from
the
United
States
.


On
December
5
,
the
system
is
presumed
to
have
dissipated
offshore
.


Throughout
the
system
's
existence
,
it
was
responsible
for
73
fatalities
,
most
of
which
resulted
from
offshore
incidents
.


The
worst
loss
of
life
took
place
off
East
Coast
,
where
the
30
crewmen
of
the
American
``
SS

''
drowned
.


Property
damage
amounted
to
$
3
million

The
Belfast
Marathon
is
a
marathon
run
every
year
in
Belfast
,
Northern
Ireland
.


The
marathon
was
held
on
May
Day
each
year
for
36
years
(
1982
to
2017
)
,
changing
to
5
May
for
2019
.


In
2018
2,200
runners
finished
the
race
.


The
race
is
divided
into
several
categories
:
mens
,
ladies
,
relay
,
veterans
and
wheelchair
.


It
is
organised
jointly
by
Belfast
City
Council
and
Northern
Ireland
Athletics
.


In
2005
the
route
was
changed
to
provide
runners
with
a
flatter
course
.


This
proved
unpopular
,
as
it
took
runners
along
roads
such
as
the
Sydenham
by-pass
,
which
were
devoid
of
spectators
.


In
2006
the
original
route
was
reinstated
,
starting
at
the
City
Hall
and
passing
both
the
Shankill
and
the
Falls
,
finishing
in
Ormeau
Park
.


The
2011
route
was
unchanged
from
the
previous
two
years
.


In
2019
a

flatter
route
was
introduced

September
2009
in
the
southern
Pacific
Ocean
adjacent
to
the
Kermadec-Tonga
subduction
zone

)
.


It
was
the
largest
earthquake
of

.


A
tsunami
was
generated
which
caused
substantial
damage
and
loss
of
life
in
Samoa
,
American
Samoa
,
and
Tonga
.


The
Pacific
Tsunami
Warning
Center
recorded
a
rise
in
sea
levels
near
the
epicenter
,
and
New
Zealand
scientists
determined
that
the
waves
measured
at
their
highest
on
the
Samoan
coast
.


The
quake
occurred
on
the
outer
rise
of
the
Kermadec-Tonga
subduction
zone
.


This
is
part
of
the
Pacific
Ring
of
Fire
,
where
tectonic
plates
in

People
took
precautions
in

band
leader
Paul
McCartney
's
first
live
performances
there
since
the

'
final
tour
,
in
1966
,
and
the
only
time
Wings
would
perform
live
in
the
US
and
Canada
.


The
world
tour
was
well-attended
and
critically
acclaimed
,
and
resulted
in
a
triple
live
album
,
``
Wings
over
America
''
,
which
Capitol
Records
released
in
December
1976
.


in
addition
,
the
tour
was
documented
in
the
television
film
``
wings
over
the
world
''
(
1979
)
and
a
cinema
release
,
``

era
,
including
``
Yesterday
''
,
``
Lady
Madonna
''
and
``
The
Long

proved
especially
popular
and
marked
the
first
time
that
McCartney
had
performed
material
from
the
Beatles

Cyclone
Ernest
was
one
of
two
intense
tropical
cyclones
in
the
2004–05
South-West
Indian
Ocean
cyclone
season
.


The
eighth
tropical
disturbance
of
the
season
,
Ernest
formed
from
a
persistent
area
of
thunderstorms
in
the
central
Indian
Ocean
.


it
initially
moved
southwestward
,
intensifying
into
tropical
storm
ernest
on
january
20
while
moving
into
the
mozambique
channel
.


After
hitting
Mayotte
,
the
storm
quickly
intensified
to
reach
peak
winds
of
165
km/h
(
105
mph
)
off
the
western
coast
of
Madagascar
.


Ernest
weakened
slightly
before
striking
the
southwest
portion
of
that
country
on
January
23
,
producing
widespread
flooding
and
gusty
winds
.


The
next
day
the
cyclone
became
extratropical
before
dissipating
on
January
25
.


On
Mayotte
,
Ernest
produced
peak
wind
gusts
of
98
km/h
(
61
mph
)
.


The
storm
drew
moisture
away
from
Malawi
,
causing
a
nine-day
period
of
dry
conditions
.


a
few
days
after
ernest
struck
madagascar
,
tropical
storm
unk
affected
the
same
region
and
produced
further
flooding
.


The
combined
effects
of
the
storms
killed
78
people
and
left
over
32,000
homeless
.


Widespread
crop
damage
sparked
food
protests
,
although
the
World
Food
Programme
provided
an
emergency
supply
of

tropical
storm
allison
was
a
tropical
storm
that
devastated
southeast
texas
in
june
of
the
2001
atlantic
hurricane
season
.


An
arguable
example
of
the
``
brown
ocean
effect
''
,
Allison
lasted
unusually
long
for
a
June
storm
,
remaining
tropical
or
subtropical
for
15
days
,
most
of
which
when
the
storm
was
over
land
dumping
torrential
rainfall
.


The
storm
developed
from
a
tropical
wave
in
the
northern
Gulf
of
Mexico
on
June
4
,
2001
,
and
struck
the
upper
Texas
coast
shortly
thereafter
.


It
drifted
northward
through
the
state
,
turned
back
to
the
south
,
and
re-entered
the
Gulf
of
Mexico
.


The
storm
continued
to
the
east-northeast
,
made
landfall
on
Louisiana
,
then
moved
across
the
southeast
United
States
and
Mid-Atlantic
.


allison
was
the
first
storm
since
tropical
storm
frances
in
1998
to
strike
the
northern
texas
coastline
.


The
storm
dropped
heavy
rainfall
along
its
path
,
peaking
at
over
40
inches
(
1,000
mm
)
in
Texas
.


The
worst
flooding
occurred
in
Houston
,
where
most
of
Allison
's
damage
occurred
:
30,000
became
homeless
after
the
storm
flooded
over
70,000
houses
and
destroyed
2,744
homes
.


Downtown
Houston
was
inundated
with
flooding
,
causing
severe
damage
to
hospitals
and
businesses
.


Twenty-three
people
died
in
Texas
.


Along
its
entire
path
,
Allison
caused
$
8.5
billion
(
2001
USD
)
in
damage
and
41
deaths
.


Aside
from
Texas
,
the
places
worst
hit
were
Louisiana
and
southeastern
Pennsylvania
.


Following
the
storm
,
President
George
W.
Bush
designated
75
counties
along
Allison
's
path
as
disaster
areas
,
which
enabled
the
citizens
affected
to
apply
for
aid
.


Then
the
fourth-costliest
Atlantic
tropical
cyclone
and
still
the
costliest
Atlantic
tropical
cyclone
that
was
never
a
major
hurricane
,
Allison
was
the
first
Atlantic
tropical
storm
to
have
its
name
retired
without
ever
having
reached
hurricane
strength
.


Hurricane
Frank
was
a
strong
tropical
cyclone
that
caused
minor
damage
in
Mexico
in
late
August
2010
.


The
ninth
tropical
cyclone
,
sixth
named
storm
,
and
third
(
and
final
)
hurricane
of
the
inactive
2010
Pacific
hurricane
season
,
Frank
formed
from
an
area
of
thunderstorms
from
the
Caribbean
Sea
,
and
became
Tropical
Depression
Nine-E
on
August
21
while
located
just
south
of
the
Mexican
Coast
.


it
moved
northwest
,
and
became
tropical
storm
frank
only
12
hours
after
it
was
declared
a
depression
.


It
strengthened
to
its
initial
peak
as
a
moderate
tropical
storm
,
and
weakened
due
to
increasing
wind
shear
late
on
the
August
23
.


It
later
recovered
,
and
became
a
hurricane
on
August
25
.


After
peaking
as
a
strong
Category
1
hurricane
,
it
rapidly

The
2004
Indian
Ocean
earthquake
and
tsunami
(
also
known
as
the
Boxing
Day
Tsunami
)
occurred
at
00:58:53
UTC
on
26
December
,
with
an
epicentre
off
the
west
coast
of
northern
Sumatra
.


It
was
an
undersea
megathrust
earthquake
that
registered
a
magnitude
of
9.1–9.3
,
reaching
a
Mercalli
intensity
up
to
IX
in
certain
areas
.


The
earthquake
was
caused
by
a
rupture
along
the
fault
between
the
Burma
Plate
and
the
Indian
Plate
.


A
series
of
large
tsunami
waves
up
to
high
were
created
by
the
underwater
seismic
activity
.


Communities
along
the
surrounding
coasts
of
the
Indian
Ocean
were
seriously
affected
,
and
the
tsunamis
killed
an
estimated
227,898
people
in
14
countries
.


The
Indonesian
city
of
Banda
Aceh
reported
the
largest
number
of
victims
.


The
earthquake
was
one
of
the
deadliest
natural
disasters
in
recorded
history
.


The
direct
results
caused
major
disruptions
to
living
conditions
and
commerce
,
particularly
in
Indonesia
,
Sri
Lanka
,
India
,
and
Thailand
.


The
earthquake
was
the
third
largest
ever
recorded
and
had
the
longest
duration
of
faulting
ever
observed
;
between
eight
and
ten
minutes
.


It
caused
the
planet
to
vibrate
as
much
as
,
and
it
remotely
triggered
earthquakes
as
far
away
as
Alaska
.


Its
epicentre
was
between
Simeulue
and
mainland
Sumatra
.


The
plight
of
the
affected
people
and
countries
prompted
a
worldwide
humanitarian
response
,
with
donations
totaling
more
than
US
$
14
billion
.


The
event
is
known
by
the
scientific
community
as
the
Sumatra–Andaman
earthquake
.


The
Zalău
explosion
occurred
on
September
14
,
2007
in
a
block
of
flats
in
Zalău
,
Romania
as
the
result
of
a
gas
leak
.


Two
people
died
and
eight
were
injured
in
the
explosion
.


The
structure
was
severely
affected
and
the
block
of
flats
E24
was
demolished
in
October
2007
.


A
total
of
19
families
were
affected
by
the
deflagration
.


They
had
been
petitioning
local
natural
gas
distributor
E.ON
Gaz
for
two
years
before
the
explosion
as
a
strong
smell
of
gas
could
be
sensed
both
inside
and
outside
the
block
of
flats
.


The
gas
network
system
had
been
eight
years
overdue
before
the
explosion
.


On
September
19
,
2007
,
hundreds
of
people
participated
in
the
funeral
of
those
who
died
in
the
explosion
.


Because
E.ON
Gaz
did
not
provide
support
to
the
affected
families
,
they
protested
in
front
of
the
headquarters
of
the
company
in
Târgu
Mureș
on
September
14
,
2009
.


In
December
2010
,
six
persons
were
sentenced
to
prison
in
connection
with
the
explosion
,
but
in
December
2011
their
sentences
were
suspended
.


Compensations
owed
to
individuals
ranged
from
67,000
to
222,000
lei
.


In
March
2012
,
the
former
owners
started
to
rebuild
the
block
of
flats
.


Tropical
Depression
Auring
formed
as
a
tropical
disturbance
late
on
December
30
,
2008
,
to
the
southeast
of
Manila
in
the
Philippines
.


over
the
next
few
days
the
disturbance
gradually
developed
before
early
on
january
3
,
the
philippine
atmospheric
,
geophysical
and
astronomical
services
administration
(
pagasa
)
and
the
japan
meteorological
agency
(
jma
)
,
reported
that
the
disturbance
had
intensified
into
the
first
tropical
depression
of
the
season
with
pagasa
assigning
the
name
unk
to
the
depression
.


As
the
Depression
was
moving
into
a
high
level
of
vertical
wind
shear
,
it
did
not
develop
any
further
and
late
on
January
5
as
the
baroclinic
zone
approached
Auring
,
it
was
downgraded
to
an
area
of
low
pressure
by
the
PAGASA
before
the
JMA
followed
suit
the
next
day
as
it
was
declared
as
dissipated
by
the
JTWC
.


Heavy
rain
from
Auring
produced
severe
flooding
in
the
eastern
Philippines
.


Two
people
were
killed
and
nine
others
were
left
missing
.


A
total
of

(
8.6
acres
)
of
corn
were
damaged
.


About
43,851
people
were
affected
by
the
depression
and

Hurricane
Irene
was
a
large
and
destructive
tropical
cyclone
which
affected
much
of
the
Caribbean
and
East
Coast
of
the
United
States
during
late
August
2011
.


The
ninth
named
storm
,
first
hurricane
,
and
first
major
hurricane
of
the
2011
Atlantic
hurricane
season
,
Irene
originated
from
a
well-defined
Atlantic
tropical
wave
that
began
showing
signs
of
organization
east
of
the
Lesser
Antilles
.


due
to
development
of
atmospheric
convection
and
a
closed
center
of
circulation
,
the
system
was
designated
as
tropical
storm
irene
on
august
20
,
2011
.


After
intensifying
,
Irene
made
landfall
in
St.
Croix
as
a
strong
tropical
storm
later
that
day
.


Early
on
August
21
,
the
storm
made
a
second
landfall
in
Puerto
Rico
.


While
crossing
the
island
,
Irene
strengthened
into
a
Category
1
hurricane
.


The
storm
paralleled
offshore
of
Hispaniola
,
continuing
to
slowly
intensify
in
the
process
.


Shortly
before
making
four
landfalls
in
the
Bahamas
,
Irene
peaked
as
a
Category
3
hurricane
.


Thereafter
,
the
storm
slowly
leveled
off
in
intensity
as
it
struck
the
Bahamas
and
then
curved
northward
after
passing
east
of
Grand
Bahama
.


Continuing
to
weaken
,
Irene
was
downgraded
to
a
Category
1
hurricane
before
making
landfall
on
the
Outer
Banks
of
North
Carolina
on
August
27
,
becoming
the
first
hurricane
to
make
landfall
in
the
United
States
since
Hurricane
Ike
in
2008
.


Early
on
the
following
day
,
the
storm
re-emerged
into
the
Atlantic
from
southeastern
Virginia
.


although
irene
remained
a
hurricane
over
water
,
it
weakened
to
a
tropical
storm
while
making
yet
another
landfall
in
the
little
egg
inlet
in
southeastern
new
jersey
on
august
27
.


A
few
hours
later
,
Irene
made
its
ninth
and
final
landfall
in
Brooklyn
,
New
York
City
.


Early
on
August
29
,
Irene
transitioned
into
an
extratropical
cyclone
while
striking
Vermont
,
after
remaining
inland
as
a
tropical
cyclone
for
less
than
12
hours
.


Throughout
its
path
,
Irene
caused
widespread
destruction
and
at
least
49
deaths
.


Damage
estimates
throughout
the
United
States
are
estimated
near
$
13.5
billion
,
making
Irene
one
of
the
costliest
hurricanes
on
record
in
the
country
.


In
addition
,
monetary
losses
in
the
Caribbean
and
Canada
were
$
830
million
and
$
130
million
respectively
for
a
total
of
nearly
$
14.2
billion
in
damage
.


Hurricane
Iris
was
a
small
,
but
powerful
tropical
cyclone
that
caused
widespread
destruction
in
Belize
.


Iris
was
the
second-strongest
storm
of
the
2001
Atlantic
hurricane
season
,
behind
Hurricane
Michelle
.


It
was
the
ninth
named
storm
,
fifth
hurricane
,
and
third
major
hurricane
of
the
year
,
forming
from
a
tropical
wave
on
October
4
just
southeast
of
Barbados
.


It
moved
westward
through
the
Caribbean
,
intensifying
into
a
tropical
storm
on
October
5
south
of
Puerto
Rico
,
and
into
a
hurricane
on
the
following
day
.


While
passing
south
of
the
Dominican
Republic
,
Iris
dropped
heavy
rainfall
that
caused
landslides
,
killing
eight
people
.


Later
,
the
hurricane
passed
south
of
Jamaica
,
where
it
destroyed
two
houses
.


On
reaching
the
western
Caribbean
Sea
,
Iris
rapidly
intensified
into
a
Category
4
on
the
Saffir–Simpson
scale
.


A
small
hurricane
with
an
eye
of
only
7
mi
(
11
km
)
in
diameter
,
Iris
reached
peak
winds
of
145
mph
(
230
km/h
)
before
making
landfall
in
southern
Belize
near
Monkey
River
Town
on
October
9
.


the
hurricane
quickly
dissipated
over
central
america
,
although
its
remnants
contributed
to
the
formation
of
tropical
storm
manuel
in
the
eastern
pacific
ocean
.


The
hurricane
caused
severe
damage—destroying
homes
,
flooding
streets
,
and
leveling
trees—in
coastal
towns
south
of
Belize
City
.


Destruction
was
heaviest
in
Belize
and
totaled
$
250
million
(
2001
USD
)
.


Because
Iris
was
compact
,
the
damage
was
largely
confined
to
72
%
of
the
houses
in
the
Toledo
district
and
50
%
of
the
houses
in
the
Stann
Creek
district
.


The
hurricane
damaged
or
destroyed
3,718
homes
nationwide
,
and
wrecked
more
than
95
%
of
the
homes
in
35
villages
in
the
poorest
parts
of
the
country
.


Iris
left
about
15,000
people
homeless
,
many
receiving
assistance
from
the
government
and
the
local
Red
Cross
chapter
.


High
winds
also
damaged
large
swaths
of
forest
and
crops
,
mostly
affecting
the
banana
industry
.


Iris
killed
24
people
in
Belize
,
including
20
who
died
when
a
scuba
diving
boat
capsized
near
Big
Creek
.


The
storm
also
killed
eight
people
and
damaged
about
2,500
homes
in
neighboring
Guatemala
,
and
later
dropped
heavy
rainfall
in
southern
Mexico
,
where
two
people
died
.

After
hitting
Davao
Oriental
and
Compostela
Valley
provinces
,
Bopha
shifted
through
the
southern
and
central
regions
of
Mindanao
,
cutting
power
to
two
provinces
and
triggering
landslides
.


More
than
170,000
people
fled
to
evacuation
centers
,
as
the
system
moved
to
the
South
China
Sea
west
of
the
Palawan
island
province
,
eventually
dissipating
on
December

Tropical
Cyclone
Bingiza
was
the
only
named
storm
to
make
landfall
in
the
inactive
2010–11
South-West
Indian
Ocean
cyclone
season
.


The
second
of
three
storms
,
Bingiza
developed
on
February
9
to
the
northeast
of
Madagascar
.


For
a
few
days
it
meandered
generally
southwestward
,
failing
to
intensify
significantly
.


On
February
12
,
the
storm
began
a
steady
westward
track
as
environmental
conditions
became
more
favorable
.


In
a
24‑hour
period
,
Bingiza
developed
from
a
moderate
tropical
storm
into
an
intense
tropical
cyclone
with
a
well-defined
eye
.


After
attaining
peak
10–minute
sustained
winds
of
155
km/h
(
100
mph
)
,
the
cyclone
moved
ashore
in
northeastern
Madagascar
on
February
14
and
quickly
weakened
as
it
crossed
the
country
.


Bingiza
emerged
into
the
Mozambique
Channel
as
a
weak
tropical
disturbance
,
and
it
turned
southward
to
move
across
western
Madagascar
.


Bingiza
attained
tropical
storm
status
before
making
its
final
landfall
near
Morondava
,
degenerating
into
a
remnant
low
on
February
17
,
and
dissipating
two
days
later
.


Across
Madagascar
,
the
cyclone
killed
34
people
and
injured
13
others
.


High
winds
destroyed
25,464
houses
,
which
left
25,845
people
homeless
.


Bingiza
first
affected
the
Masoala
National
Park
,
destroying
half
of
a
village
and
leaving
it
isolated
.


High
winds
and
heavy
rainfall
left
over
500
kmkm
(
195
mi
)
of
damaged
crops
,
which
increased
food
prices
and
threatened
the
economic
livelihoods
of
the
affected
people
.


The
Clerkenwell
explosion
,
also
known
as
the
Clerkenwell
Outrage
,
was
a
bombing
in
London
on
13
December
1867
.


The
Irish
Republican
Brotherhood
,
nicknamed
the
``
Fenians
''
,
exploded
a
bomb
to
try
to
free
one
of
their
members
being
held
on
remand
at
Clerkenwell
Prison
.


The
explosion
damaged
nearby
houses
,
killed
12
people
and
caused
120
injuries
.


None
of
the
prisoners
escaped
.


The
event
was
described
by
``
The
Times
''
the
following
day
as
``
a
crime
of
unexampled
atrocity
''
,
and
compared
to
the
``
infernal
machines
''
used
in
Paris
in
1800
and
1835
and
the
Gunpowder
Treason
of
1605
.


The
bombing
was
later
described
as
the
most
infamous
action
carried
out
by
the
Fenians
in
Britain
in
the
19th
century
.


It
enraged
the
public
,
causing
a
backlash
of
hostility
in
Britain
which
undermined
efforts
to
establish
home
rule
or
independence
for
Ireland
.

The
Toronto
Marathon
,
held
annually
in
May
,
is
a
race
from
Mel
Lastman
Square
,
in
the
north
end
of
Toronto
,
to
Ontario
Place
.


The
race
was
initially
called
the
Canadian
International
Marathon
,
and
was
first
held
in
1995
under
its
current
organizer
.


The
origins
of
the
event
trace
back
to
1977
.


In
2003
,
its
name
was
changed
to
the
Toronto
Marathon
.


In
2008
,
it
was
again
renamed
for
a
new
primary
sponsor
,
GoodLife
Fitness
.


It
was
held
previously
on
the
third
Sunday
in
October
,
the
first
Sunday
after
Canadian
Thanksgiving
,
for
16
consecutive
years
.


Because
of
concerns
that
the
Toronto
Waterfront
Marathon
was
being
held
three
weeks
prior
lead
to
too
many
road
closures
,
the
Toronto
Marathon
is
now
run
in
May
,
beginning
in
2011
.


The
event
was
temporarily
held
mid-May
in

,
due
to
other
events
in
the
City
of
Toronto
that
year
.


The
event
is
now
held
on
the
first
Sunday
in
May
,
beginning
in
2012
.


In
addition
to
a
full
marathon
,
the
event
also
includes
a
half
marathon
,
a
10K
run
,
a
5K
run
,
and
an
eight-person
relay
across
the
marathon
course
.


The
marathon
meets
international
standards
and
is
a
qualifier
for
the
Boston
Marathon
.

The
1958
Masters
Tournament
was
the
22nd
Masters
Tournament
,
held
April
3–6
at
Augusta
National
Golf
Club
in
Augusta
,
Georgia
.


Arnold
Palmer
won
the
first
of
his
four
Masters
titles
,
one
stroke
ahead
of
runners-up
Doug
Ford
and
Fred
Hawkins
.


It
was
the
first
of
his
seven
major
titles
.


Palmer
,
age
28
,
was
the
third
round
co-leader
and
eagled
the
13th
hole
on
Sunday
to
propel
him
to
victory
,
as
he
three-putted
on
the
final
green
.


Three-time
champion
Sam
Snead
,
age
45
,
was
the
other
co-leader
after
54
holes
,
but
shot
a
79
(
+7
)
on
Sunday
to
fall
to
13th
place
.


One
stroke
back
entering
the
final
round
was
1955
champion
Cary
Middlecoff
,
who
carded
a
75
in
the
final
round
and
tied
for
6th
.


Palmer
's
first
Masters
victory
was
not
without
some
controversy
.


On
the
12th
hole
of
the
final
round
,
Palmer
thought
his
tee
ball
was
embedded
behind
the
green
but
the
on-site
rules
official
would
not
give
him
relief
.


Playing
that
ball
as
it
lay
,
Palmer
made
a
double-bogey
.


Upset
over
the
questionable
ruling
and
the
double-bogey
,
Palmer
then
played
a
second
ball
from
behind
the
green
and
,
after
taking
relief
,
made
a
par
.


Several
holes
later
word
came
from
the
tournament
officials
that
Palmer
was
entitled
to
relief
and
his
par
score
on
12
would
stand
.


Prior
to
the
tournament
,
two
stone
arch
bridges
crossing
Rae
's
Creek
were
dedicated
,
honoring
two-time
champions
Ben
Hogan
and
Byron
Nelson
.


Hogan
's
is
at
the
par-3
12th
hole
,
and
commemorated
his
record
72-hole
score
in
1953
,
his
second
win
at
Augusta
and
first
of
three
consecutive
majors
that
year
.


The
other
bridge
departs
the
13th
tee
;
Nelson
went
birdie-eagle
at
these
two
holes
in
the
final
round
in
1937
,
gained
six
strokes
on
the
leader
,
and
won
the
first
of
his
five
majors
.


``

Illustrated
''
writer
Herbert
Warren
Wind
first
used
the
term
``
Amen
Corner
''
in
a
story
to
describe
where
the
critical
final
day
's
action
had
occurred
.


This
was
the
first

The
Major
League
Baseball
All-Star
Game
,
also
known
as
the
``
Midsummer
Classic
''
,
is
an
annual
professional
baseball
game
sanctioned
by
Major
League
Baseball
(
MLB
)

considered
to
be
moderate
,
the
earthquake
's
depth
(
estimates
of
which
vary
between

were
more
widely
felt
.

The
Battle
of
Cedar
Creek
,
or
Battle
of
Belle
Grove
,
fought
October
19
,
1864
,
was
the
culminating
battle
of
the
Valley
Campaigns
of
1864
during
the
American
Civil
War
.


Confederate
Lt.
Gen.
Jubal
Early
launched
a
surprise
attack
against
the
encamped
army
of
Union
Maj.
Gen.
Philip
Sheridan
,
across
Cedar
Creek
,
northeast
of
Strasburg
,
Virginia
.


During
the
morning
fighting
,
seven
Union
infantry
divisions
were
forced
to
fall
back
and
lost
numerous
prisoners
and
cannons
.


Early
failed
to
continue
his
attack
north
of
Middletown
,
and
Sheridan
,
dramatically
riding
to
the
battlefield
from
Winchester
,
was
able
to
rally
his
troops
to
hold
a
new
defensive
line
.


A
Union
counterattack
that
afternoon
routed
Early
's
army
.


at
the
conclusion
of
this
battle
,
the
final
confederate
invasion
of
the
north
was
effectively
ended
.


The
Confederacy
was
never
again
able
to
threaten
Washington
,
D.C.
through
the
Shenandoah
Valley
,
nor
protect
one
of
its
key
economic
bases
in
Virginia
.


The
stunning
Union
victory
aided
the
reelection
of
Abraham
Lincoln
and
won
Sheridan

fame
.


The
2009
Peruvian
political
crisis
resulted
from
the
ongoing
opposition
to
oil
development
in
the
Peruvian
Amazon
by
local
Native
Americans
;
they
protested
Petroperú
and
confronted
the
National
Police
.


at
the
forefront
of
the
movement
to
resist
the
development
was
UNK
unk
de
desarrollo
de
la
selva
(
unk
)
,
a
coalition
of
indigenous
community
organizations
in
the
region
.


Following
the
government
's
decision
to
pass
regulations
allowing
companies
access
to
the
Amazon
,
natives
conducted
more
than
a
year
of
declared
opposition
and
advocacy
to
change
this
policy
and
,
from
9
April
,
began
a
period
of
protest
and
civil
disobedience
.


In
June
2009
,
the
Garcia
government
suspended
civil
liberties
,
declared
a
state
of
emergency
,
and
sent
in
the
military
to
stop
the
protests
.


The
military
intervention
,
referred
to
as
the
``
Baguazo
''
,
resulted
in
two
days
of
bloody
confrontations
,
resulting
in
a
total
of
23
police
deaths
,
10
native/civilians
deaths
and
more
than
150
native
wounded
.


This
conflict
has
been
described
as
Peru
's
worst
political
violence
in
years
and
is
the
worst
crisis
of
President
Alan
García
's
presidency
.


Prime
Minister
Yehude
Simon
was
forced
to
resign
his
post
in
the
aftermath
,
and
Congress
repealed
the
laws
that
led
to
the
protests
.


the
iraqi
revolt
against
the
british
,
also
known
as
the
1920
iraqi
revolt
or
great
iraqi
revolution
,
started
in
baghdad
in
the
summer
of
1920
with
mass
demonstrations
by
iraqis
,
including
protests
by
embittered
officers
from
the
old
ottoman
army
,
against
the
british
occupation
of
iraq
.


The
revolt
gained
momentum
when
it
spread
to
the
largely
tribal
Shia
regions
of
the
middle
and
lower
Euphrates
.


Sheikh
Mehdi
Al-Khalissi
was
a
prominent
Shia
leader
of
the
revolt
.


Sunni
and
Shia
religious
communities
cooperated
during
the
revolution
as
well
as
tribal
communities
,
the
urban
masses
,
and
many
Iraqi
officers
in
Syria
.


The
objectives
of
the
revolution
were
independence
from
British
rule
and
creation
of
an
Arab
government
.


though
the
revolt
achieved
some
initial
success
,
by
the
end
of
october
1920
,
the
british
had
crushed
the
revolt
.


although
the
revolt
was
largely
over
by
the
end
of
1920
,
elements
of
it
dragged
on
until
1922
.


During
the
1920
revolt
,
another
anti-British
rebellion
took
place
in
the
north
Iraq
by
the
Kurds
,
who
were
trying
to
gain
independence
.


One
of
the
major
Kurdish
leaders
of
the
Kurdish
revolt
was
Sheikh
Mahmoud
Barzanji
.

The
Reformasi
was
a
protest
movement
that
began
in
September
1998
throughout
Malaysia
initiated
by
Anwar
Ibrahim
after
his
sacking
as
Deputy
Prime
Minister
by
the
country
's
then-Prime
Minister
,
Mahathir
Mohamad
in
the
same
month
.


The
massive
movement
,
which
occurred
while
the
country
hosted
the
Commonwealth
Games
,
consisted
of
civil
disobedience
,
demonstrations
,
sit-ins
,
rioting
,
occupations
and
online
activism
,
involving
thousands
across
Malaysia
protesting
against
the
Barisan
Nasional
(
BN
)
government
under
the
Mahathir
Cabinet
.


The
movement
started
off
as
a
political
campaign
calling
for
the
resignation
of
Mahathir
,
Malaysia
's
longest-serving
Prime
Minister
and
the
end
of
corruption
and
cronyism
allegedly
associated
with
the
government
of
the
day
.


Building
on
the
momentum
of
the
Reformasi
,
a
political
movement
called
the
Social
Justice
Movement
(
)
(
ADIL
)
was
formed
and
led
by
Wan
Azizah
Wan
Ismail
,
Anwar
's
wife
in
1998
.


however
,
after
facing
difficulties
in
registering
adil
as
a
political
party
,
the
reformasi
movement
took
over
a
small
dormant
party
``
unk
masyarakat
islam
malaysia
''
(
unk
)
and
led
to
the
formation
of
a
new
unk
party
named
``
parti
keadilan
nasional
''
or
national
justice
party
(
keadilan
)
in
1999
.


On
3
August
2003
,
the
newly
merged
entity
of
KEADILAN
and
``
Parti
Rakyat
Malaysia
''
(
PRM
)
was
officially
launched
and
assumed
its
current
name
,
``
Parti
Keadilan
Rakyat
(
PKR
)
.


The
Reformasi
movement
is
still
considered
to
be
ongoing
even
after
the
2018
Malaysian
general
election
which
saw
Barisan
Nasional
(
BN
)
lose
its
parliamentary
majority
to
the
Pakatan
Harapan
(
PH
)
coalition
and
for
the
first
time
since
Malaysia
's
independence
become
the
official
opposition
.


The
2014
Caribbean
Cup
was
the
18th
edition
of
the
Caribbean
Cup
,
an
international
football
competition
for
national
teams
of
member
nations
affiliated
with
the
Caribbean
Football

March
2014
,
it
was
announced
that
Jamaica
would
host
the
final
stage
.


For
the
first
time
,
the
competition
and
its
qualifying
stages
were
scheduled
to
take
place
during
officially
sanctioned
FIFA
international
match
periods
.


The
change
was
made
to
assist
the
national
Football
Associations
selecting
high
profile
Caribbean
players
whose
clubs
would
be
otherwise
reluctant
to
lose
the
players
service
while
on
international
duty
.


Previous
editions
of
the
competition
have
taken
place
on
non-FIFA
calendar
dates
.


Horace
Burrell
,
the
Jamaican
Football
Federation
President
stated
that
the
change
would
``
ensure
the
tournament
has
star
power
''
.


The
top
four
teams
would
qualify
for
the
2015
CONCACAF
Gold
Cup
automatically
while
the
fifth
place
team
would
advance
to
a
play-off
against
the
fifth
place
team
from
the
2014
Copa
Centroamericana
tournament
.


This
is
the
first
time
that
the
two
overall
fifth-placed
teams
compete
to
qualify
for
the
CONCACAF
Gold
Cup
,
previously
five
teams
from
Central
America
and
four
from
the
Caribbean
have
qualified
for
the
Confederation
's
competition
.


The
winner
of
the
tournament
would
qualify
for
the
Copa
América
Centenario
,
a
16-team
tournament
of
CONMEBOL
and
CONCACAF
national
teams
to
be
held
in
the
United

in
2016

The
Northwestern
Syria
offensive
(
April–June
2015
)
,
dubbed
by
the
rebels
as
the
Battle
of
Victory
,
took
place
in
the
Idlib
and
Hama
governorates
during
the
Syrian
Civil
War
.


The
campaign
consisted
of
a
three-pronged
attack
,
with
the
two
main
assaults
spearheaded
by
Ahrar
ash-Sham
,
al-Qaeda-affiliated
Jabhat
al-Nusra
and
other
Islamist
factions
under
the
banner
of
the
Army
of
Conquest
,
and
the
remaining
attack
force
including
collaboration
with
Free
Syrian
Army
brigades
.


The
commander
of
the
FSA
13th
Division
stated
that
coordinating
with
other
groups
such
as
al-Nusra
Front
did
not
mean
they
were
aligned
with
them
.


Within
days
,
the
rebels
captured
the
city
of
Jisr
al-Shughur
and
later
on
an
Army
base
.


The
success
of
the
campaign
was
attributed
to
better
coordination
between
the
Syrian
opposition
's
backers
.


Still
,
the
operation
resulted
in
a
high
attrition
rate
for
both
sides
.

leg
in
England
,
the

The
1944
Great
Atlantic
hurricane
was
a
destructive
and
powerful
tropical
cyclone
that
swept
across
a
large
portion
of
the
United
States
East
Coast
in
September
1944
.


Impacts
were
most
significant
in
New
England
,
though
significant
effects
were
also
felt
along
the
Outer
Banks
,
Mid-Atlantic
states
,
and
the
Canadian
Maritimes
.


Due
to
its
ferocity
and
path
,
the
storm
drew
comparisons
to
the
1938
Long
Island
Express
,
known
as
one
of
the
worst
storms
in
New
England
history
.


though
the
precursor
to
the
1944
hurricane
was
first
identified
well
east
of
the
lesser
antilles
on
september
4
,
the
disturbance
only
became
well
organized
to
be
considered
a
tropical
cyclone
on
september
9
northeast
of
the
virgin
islands
.


Tracking
west-northwest
,
the
storm
gradually
intensified
and
reached
peak
intensity
as
a
Category
4-equivalent
hurricane
on
September
13
north
of
the
Bahamas
after
curving
northward
.


A
day
later
,
the
storm
passed
by
the
Outer
Banks
and
later
made
landfall
on
Long
Island
and
Rhode
Island
as
a
weaker
hurricane
on
September
15
.


The
storm
eventually
transitioned
into
an
extratropical
cyclone
,
after
which
it
continued
moving
northeast
before
merging
with
another
extratropical
system
off
of
Greenland
on
September
16

Tracking
northwestward
,
the

failed
to
develop
and
warnings
on
it
were
discontinued
on
May
27
.


at
the
same
time
,
a
second
system
began
organizing
along
the
west
coast
of
luzon
.


The
two
systems
ultimately
merged
into
one
over
the
Philippines
between
May
28
and
29
.


Now
tracking
northeastward
,
the
system
re-intensified
and
became
a
tropical
storm
on
May
30
.


Lucille
attained
its
peak
intensity
later
that
day
with
winds
of
85
km/h
(

mph
)
.


As
it
accelerated
over
open
waters
,
the
system
brushed
the
islands
of
Iwo
Jima
and
Chichi-jima
before
transitioning
into
an
extratropical
cyclone
on
June
1
.


The
remnants
of
Lucille
were
last
noted
on
June
4
near
the
International
Date
Line
.


Between
May
27
and
29
,
heavy
rains
fell
across
much
of
Luzon
as
Lucille
developed
.


These
rains
,
amounting
to
in
the
suburbs
of
Manila
,
triggered
destructive
floods
that
left
some
areas
under
of
water
.


The
worst
of
the
floods
took
place
during
the
overnight
hours
of
May
28
to
29
.


During
that
time
,
hundreds
of
homes
were
swept
away
and
an
estimated
300–500
people
,
including
at
least
80
children
,
were
killed
.


Monetary
losses
from
the
floods
exceeded
$
2
million
.


The
Battle
of
Møn
,
also
known
as
the
Battle
of
Lolland
,
took
place
31
May–1
June
1677
,
as
part
of
the
Scanian
War
.


A
smaller
Swedish
squadron
under
Admiral
Erik
Sjöblad
attempted
to
sail
from
Gothenburg
to
join
the
main
Swedish
fleet
in
the
Baltic
Sea
.


It
was
intercepted
by
a
superior
Danish
force
under
Niels
Juel
and
decimated
over
the
course
of
two
days
.


The
Swedes
lost
8
ships
and
over
1,500
men
dead
,
injured
or
captured
,
including
Admiral
Sjöblad
himself
,
while
the
Danish
losses
were
insignificant
.


The
victory
prevented
the
Swedish
navy
from
concentrating
its
forces
and
provided
valuable
prize
ships
for
the
Danish
navy
.


It
confirmed
Danish
supremacy
at
sea
during
the
war
and
laid
the
ground
for
the
major
Danish
victory
at
Køge
Bay

were
burning
across
the
Australian
state

Victoria
on
and
around
Saturday
,
7
February
2009
and
were
among

's
all-time
worst
bushfire
disasters
.


The
fires
occurred
during

resulted
in
Australia
's
highest
ever
loss
of
life
from
a
bushfire

Nigeria
clashes
happened
in
several
towns
in
northern
Nigeria
in
late
December
2011
,
within
the
context
of
the
Boko
Haram
insurgency
.


A
major
confrontation
between
suspected
Boko
Haram
members
and
security
forces
broke
out
in
the
city
of
Damaturu
on
22
December
2011
and
continued
into
the
next
day
.


Army
sources
confirmed
they
had
killed
at
least
50
militants
during
the
two-day
battle
,
over-running
an
insurgent
base
and
munitions
depot
.


At
least
7
soldiers
were
killed
during
the
clashes
,
including
four
that
were
shot
to
death
in
a
drive-by
attack
late
on
23
December
.


Another
shootout
took
place
in
the
remote
town
of
Maiduguri
,
where
at
least
11
people
were
confirmed
dead
by
the
local
morgue

The
canoeing
races
at
the
2012
Olympic
Games
in
London
were
contested
in
two
main
disciplines
:
the
slalom
,
from
29
July
to
2
August
,
and
the
sprint
,
from
6
to
11
August
.


The
slalom
competition
was
held
at
the
Lee
Valley
White
Water
Centre
and
the
sprint
events
were
staged
at
Eton
College
Rowing
Centre
,
at
Dorney
Lake
,
known
as
Eton
Dorney
.


Around
330
athletes
took
part
in
16
events
.


The
men
's
500m
sprints
were
replaced
by
a
200m
race
;
in
addition
,
the
men
's
C-2
500m
was
replaced
by
a
women
's
K-1
200m
sprint
.


This
was
confirmed
at
an
International
Canoe
Federation
board
meeting
at
Windsor
,
Berkshire
,
on
5
December
2009
.


For
the
first
time
,
women
competed
in
two
individual
events
in
sprint
canoeing
.


Because
of
the
changes
,
the
finals
were
spread
over
a
three-day
period
instead
of
the
traditional
two
days
which
had
been
in
effect
since
the
1976
Games
.


The
most
successful
nation
in
the
slalom
was
France
,
with
two
gold
medals
in
the
four
events
,
followed
by
Great
Britain
with
one
gold
and
one
silver
.


In
the
sprint
,
Hungary
was
the
most
successful
with
three
gold
,
two
silver
and
one
bronze
medal
,
while
Germany
topped
the

The
1992
Big
Bear
earthquake
occurred
at
on
June
28
in
Big
Bear
Lake
,
California
,
with
a
moment
magnitude
of
6.5
and
a
maximum
perceived
intensity
of
VIII
(
``
Severe
''
)
on
the
Mercalli
intensity
scale
.


The
earthquake
occurred
at
a
relatively
shallow
depth
of
and
caused
landslides
in
the
San
Bernardino
Mountains
.


The
Big
Bear
earthquake
happened
east
of
Los
Angeles
,
and
3
hours
26
minutes
after
the
M
7.3
1992
Landers
earthquake
occurred
22
miles
(
35
km
)
to
the
east
.


The
Big
Bear
earthquake
was
first
believed
to
be
an
aftershock
of
the
Landers
quake
.


However
,
the
United
States
Geological
Survey
determined
that
this
was
a
separate
,
but
related
,
earthquake
.


These
two
earthquakes
are
considered
a
regional
earthquake
sequence
,
rather
than
a
main
shock
and
aftershock
.


They
were
part
of
a
complex
pattern
of
regional
stress
adjustment
that
also
led
to
the
1999
Hector
Mine
earthquake
.


Hurricane
Erika
was
a
weak
hurricane
that
struck
extreme
northeastern
Mexico
near
the
Texas-Tamaulipas
border
in
mid-August
of
the
2003
Atlantic
hurricane
season
.


Erika
was
the
eighth
tropical
cyclone
,
fifth
tropical
storm
,
and
third
hurricane
of
the
season
.


at
first
,
the
national
hurricane
center
(
nhc
)
operationally
did
not
designate
it
as
a
hurricane
because
initial
data
suggested
winds
of
70
mph
(
115
km/h
)
at
erika
's
peak
intensity
.


It
was
not
until
later
data
was
analyzed
that
the
NHC
revised
it
to
Category
1
intensity
in
the
Saffir-Simpson
Hurricane
Scale
.


The
storm
developed
from
a
non-tropical
area
of
low
pressure
that
was
tracked
for
five
days
before
developing
in
the
eastern
Gulf
of
Mexico
on
August
14
.


Under
the
influence
of
a
high
pressure
system
,
Erika
moved
quickly
westward
and
strengthened
under
favorable
conditions
.


It
made
landfall
as
a
hurricane
on
northeastern
Mexico
on
August
16
and
rapidly
dissipated
inland
.


While
Erika
's
precursor
disturbance
was
moving
across
Florida
,
it
dropped
heavy
rainfall
.


In
south
Texas
,
Erika
produced
moderate
winds
of
50
to
60
mph
(
80
to
95
km/h
)
along
with
light
rain
,
causing
minor
and
isolated
wind
damage
in
the
state
.


In
northeastern
Mexico
,
Erika
produced
moderate
amounts
of
rainfall
,
resulting
in
mudslides
and
flooding
.


There
,
two
people
were
killed
when
their
vehicle
was
swept
away
by
floodwaters

Operation
Avalanche
was
a
four-week
U.S.-led
offensive
in
December
2003
designed
to
disrupt
a
resurgence
in
militant
activity
in
the
southeastern
territory
of
Afghanistan
and
to
establish
conditions
for
the
provision
of
humanitarian
aid
.


Described
by
the
U.S.
government
as
the
biggest
ground
operation
in
Afghanistan
since
the
fall
of
the
Taliban
in
late
2001
,
the
offensive
led
to
the
capture
of
more
than
100
suspects
and
the
deaths
of
10
.


Two
soldiers
from
the
Afghan
National
Army
were
killed
.


The
operation
was
marred
by
the
accidental
killings
of
15
children
in
raids
on
suspected
militants
.


The
operation
involved
2,000
U.S.
soldiers
supported
by
Afghan
troops
,
but
failed
to
engage
any
Taliban
or
allied
militants
.


Patrols
were
conducted
and
caves
searched
over
a
40
square
mile
(

featured
many
celebrity

,
and
Cory
Everson
.


The
Roadshow
was
overseen
by
the
HealthSouth

Chairman
was
Bo
Jackson
.


Board
Member
Dr.
James
Andrews
came
up
with
the
idea

The
1952
Kern
County
earthquake
occurred
on
July
21
in
the
southern
San
Joaquin
Valley
and
measured
7.3
on
the
moment
magnitude
scale
.


The
main
shock
occurred
at
4:52
am
Pacific
Daylight
Time
(
11:52
UTC
)
,
killed
12
people
and
injured
hundreds
,
and
caused
an
estimated
$
60
million
in
property
damage
.


A
small
sector
of
damage
near
Bealville
corresponded
to
a
maximum
Mercalli
intensity
of
XI
(
``
Extreme
''
)
,
though
this
intensity
rating
was
not
representative
of
the
majority
of
damage
.


The
earthquake
occurred
on
the
White
Wolf
Fault
near
the
community
of
Wheeler
Ridge
and
was
the
strongest
to
occur
in
California
since
the
1906
San
Francisco
earthquake
.


The
town
of
Tehachapi
suffered
the
greatest
damage
and
loss
of
life
from
the
earthquake
,
though
other
locations
in
Kern
County
experienced
significant
damage
as
well
,
but
its
effects
were
widely
felt
throughout
central
and
southern
California
.


The
July
mainshock
had
a
significant
aftershock
sequence
that
persisted
into
July
and
August
with
many
magnitude
5+
events
with
intensities
of
V
(
``
Moderate
''
)
to
VII
(
``
Very
strong
''
)
.


Six
of
these
aftershocks
occurred
on
the
day
of
the
mainshock
,
but
the
strongest
aftershock
came
on
August
22
as
a
M5.8
event
that
had
a
maximum
perceived
intensity
of
VIII
(
``
Severe
''
)
and
resulted
in
the
deaths
of
two
people
and
caused
an
additional
$
10
million
in
property
damage
.


Following
the
event
,
a
field
survey
was
conducted
along
the
fault
zone
with
the
goal
of
estimating
the
peak
ground
acceleration
of
the
shock
based
on
visually
evaluating
precarious
rock
formations
and
other
indicators
.


Ground
disturbances
that
were
created
by
the
earthquakes
were
also
surveyed
,
both
in
the
valley
and
in
the
foothills
,
with
both
vertical
and
horizontal
displacements
present
in
the
epicentral
area
.


The
strong
motion
records
that
were
acquired
from
the
event
were
significant
,
and
a
reconnaissance
report
was
recognized
for
its
coverage
of
the
event
,
and
how
it
set
a
standard
for
those
types
of
engineering
or
scientific
papers
.


Repercussions
of
the
sequence
of
earthquakes
were
still
being
felt
in
the
heavily
damaged
downtown
area
of
Bakersfield
well
into
the
1990s
as
city
leaders
attempted
to
improve
safety
of
the
surviving
unreinforced
masonry
buildings
.


the
katyn
commission
or
the
international
katyn
commission
was
the
international
red
cross
committee
formed
in
april
1943
under
request
by
germany
to
investigate
the
katyn
massacre
of
some
22,000
polish
nationals
during
the
soviet
occupation
of
eastern
poland
,
mostly
prisoners
of

from
the
september
campaign
including
polish
army
officers
,
intelligentsia
,
civil
servants
,
priests
,
police
officers
and
numerous
other
professionals
.


Their
bodies
were
discovered
in
a
series
of
large
mass
graves
in
the
forest
near
Smolensk
in
Russia
following
Operation
Barbarossa

The
investigation
was
led
by

,
Dr.
Ferenc
Orsós
from

and
Eduard
Miloslavić
,
Croatian
professor
of
pathology
among
others
.


the
commission
concluded
that
the
soviet
union
had
been
responsible
for
the
massacre
.


Consequently
,
the
German
government
made
extensive
reference
to
the
massacre
in
its
own
propaganda
in
an
attempt
to
drive
a
political
wedge
between
the
Allies
of

a
direct
result
of
Polish
support
for
the
investigation
.


the
soviets
denied
their
responsibility
for
the
crime
immediately
,
and
instead
,
created
their
own
extraordinary
state

Hurricane
Celia
was
the
costliest
tropical
cyclone
in
Texas
history
until
Hurricane
Alicia
in
1983
.


The
third
named
storm
,
second
hurricane
,
and
first
major
hurricane
of
the
1970
Atlantic
hurricane
season
,
Celia
developed
from
a
tropical
wave
in
the
western
Caribbean
Sea
on
July
31
.


Initially
,
the
depression
tracked
north-northwestward
without
significantly
strengthening
,
and
crossed
over
western
Cuba
on
August
1
.


Heavy
rains
on
the
island
caused
severe
flooding
,
leading
to
five
fatalities
.


the
depression
entered
the
gulf
of
mexico
and
was
upgraded
to
tropical
storm
celia
later
on
august
1
.


Due
to
warm
sea
surface
temperatures
,
Celia
rapidly
intensified
into
a
major
hurricane
on
August
1
and
after
the
creation
of
the
Saffir–Simpson
hurricane
wind
scale
in
1971
she
was
estimated
to
have
been
a
Category

of
florida
,
especially
the
panhandle
,
causing
eight
people
to
drown
.


Early
on
August
2
,
Celia
began
to
weaken
.


However
,
the
storm
underwent
rapid
deepening
again
and
peaked
as
a
Category
3
hurricane
with
winds
of
125
mph
(
205
km/h
)
on
August
3
.


In
Louisiana
,
tides
caused
minor
coastal
flooding
.


Minor
erosion
damage
was
reported
along
Highway
82
in
Cameron
Parish
.


Late
on
August
3
,
Celia
made
landfall
near
Corpus
Christi
,
Texas
.


Throughout
the
state
,
8,950
homes
were
destroyed
and
damaged
about
55,650
others
.


About
252
small
businesses
,
331
boats
,
and
310
farm
buildings
were
either
damaged
or
destroyed
.


Impact
was
the
worst
in

suffered
severe
damage
or
were
destroyed
.


Additionally
,
about
90
%
of
the
buildings
in
downtown
were
damaged
to
some
degree
.


Celia
weakened
as
it
continued
further
inland
and
dissipated
over
New
Mexico
on
August
6
.


The
remnants
of
Celia
brought

)
in
damage
.


The
1995
Gulf
of
Aqaba
earthquake
(
also
known
as
Nuweiba
earthquake
)
occurred
on
November
22
at
06:15
local
time
(
04:15
UTC
)
and
registered
7.3
on
the
scale
.


The
epicenter
was
located
in
the
central
segment
of
the
Gulf
of
Aqaba
,
the
narrow
body
of
water
that
separates
Egypt
's
Sinai
Peninsula
from
the
western
border
of
Saudi
Arabia
.


At
least
8
people
were
killed
and
30
were
injured
in
the
meizoseismal
area
.


The
earthquake
occurred
along
the
Dead
Sea
Transform
(
DST
)
fault
system
,
an
active
tectonic
plate
boundary
with
seismicity
that
is
characterized
by
long-running
quiescent
periods
with
occasional
large
and
damaging
earthquakes
,
along
with
intermittent
earthquake
swarms
.


It
was
the
strongest
tectonic
event
in
the
area
for
many
decades
and
caused
injuries
,
damage
,
and
deaths
throughout
the
Levant
and
is
also
thought
to
have
remotely
triggered
a
series
of
small
to
moderate
earthquakes
to
the
north
of
the
epicenter
.


In
the
aftermath
of
the
quake
,
several
field
investigations
set
out
to
determine
the
extent
of
any
surface
faulting
,
and
the
distribution
of
aftershocks
was
analyzed
.


The
Bombardment
of
Ancona
was

''
coming
out
as
the
victor
,
damaging
the
enemy
destroyer
.


The
next
day
on
May
24
,
the
majority
of
the
Austrian
fleet
at
Pola
steamed
for
the
Adriatic
coast
of
Italy
.


This
included
the
dreadnoughts
,
,
and
eight
pre-dreadnoughts
.


Other
Austro-Hungarian
ships
were
already
in
enemy
waters
or
proceeding
to
the
Ancona
coast
themselves
.


The
fleet
bombarded
several
of
the
Italian
coastal
cities
and
other
targets
in
and
around
the
Province
of
Ancona
,
especially
damaging
the
city
of

di
Ferrara
''
off
Ancona
.


The
pre-dreadnought
and
two
torpedo
boats
bombarded
Potenza
Picena
,
then
returned
to
Pola
naval
base
.


The
pre-dreadnought
—along
with
two
more
torpedo
boats—bombarded
Senigallia
,
destroying
a
train
and
damaging
a
railway
station
and
a
bridge
,
before
returning
to

.


The
torpedo
boat
was
unsuccessfully
bombed
by
an
Italian
flying
boat
.


Austrian
light
cruiser
bombarded
the
Italian
signal
station
at
Cretaccio
Island
,
while
—with
two
torpedo
boats—shelled
Rimini
,
damaging
a
freight
train
.


The
destroyer
attacked
the
signal
station
near
Torre
di
Mileto
.


The
light
cruiser
,
a
destroyer
and
two
torpedo
boats
entered
Corsini
Channel
and
shelled
an
Italian
torpedo
boat
station
,
another
semaphore
station
,
and
few
batteries
of
coastal
artillery
.


The
light
cruiser
—supported
by
four
destroyers—ran
into
the
Italian
destroyer
``
Turbine
''
,
in
a
pitched
battle
south
of
Pelagosa
.


The
destroyer
shelled
the
railway
embankment
near
Manfredonia
while
the
destroyer
shelled
the
Manfredonia
railway
station
.


Finally
Austro-Hungarian
flying
boats
dropped
ordnance
on
Venice
and
seaplane
hangars
at
Chiaravalle
.


Heavy
damage
was
inflicted
by
the
Austrian
navy
,
and
63
people
,
both
Italian
military
and
civilian
personnel
,
died
in
Ancona
alone
.


The
dome
of
Ancona
Cathedral
was
damaged
,
too
.


Austrian
casualties
were
light

The
war
in
the
Adriatic
Sea
continued
,
culminating
in
a
large
Allied
blockade
to
prevent
the
Austro-Hungarian
fleet
from
leaving
the
Adriatic
.


The
``
Otranto
Barrage
''
would
be
raided
by
the
Austro-Hungarians
several
times
throughout
the
war
,
but
major
Austro-Hungarian
warships
rarely
left
the
bases
after
this
raid
.


The
Forward
on
Climate
rally
was
held
at
the
National
Mall
in
Washington
,
D.C.
on
February
17
,
2013
.


The
goal
of
the
demonstration
was
to
spur
President
Barack
Obama
and
Congress
to
take
more
action
to
address
global
warming
.


Opposition
to
the
proposed
expansion
of
the
Keystone
XL
Pipeline
,
that
was
still
pending
at
the
time
,
was
a
particular
focus
of
the
rally
.


Among
the
speakers
were
Sierra
Club
Director
Michael
Brune
,
U.S
.


Senator
Sheldon
Whitehouse
,
actress
and
activist
Rosario
Dawson
,
350.org
founder
Bill
McKibben
,
and
Obama
's
former
Special
Advisor
for

Jobs
Van
Jones
.


participants
marched
from
the
national
mall
to
the
white
house
.


Attendance
was
estimated
at
35,000
(
estimates
ranged
from
10,000
by
a
police
officer
to
50,000
by
350.org
)
,
and
was
thought
to
have
been
the
largest
climate
rally
in
American
history
.


The
rally
was
arranged
by
the
Sierra
Club
,
the
Hip
Hop
Caucus
,
350.org
,
and

The
2011
Colorado
earthquake
occurred
on
August
22
at
with
a
moment
magnitude
of
5.3
and
a
maximum
Mercalli
intensity
of
V
(
``
Moderate
''
)
.


The
epicenter
of
the
intraplate
earthquake
was
west
northwest
of
Trinidad
,
Colorado
,
and
south
of
Denver
,
according
to
the
United
States
Geological
Survey
(
USGS
)
.


It
was
the
largest
natural
earthquake
to
affect
Colorado
for
more
than
a
hundred
years
.


The
earthquake
occurred
as
part
of
a
swarm
of
smaller
quakes
that
started
the
previous
day
.


The
last
time
the
Colorado
region
received
a
series
of
earthquakes
was
in
2001
,
when
about
a
dozen
smaller-sized
temblors
were
recorded
.


The
shock
occurred
as
a
result
of
normal
faulting
and
was
similar
in
depth
,
style
and
location
to
the
events
that
made
up
the
2001
swarm
.


Hurricane

season
.


Developing
from
a
tropical
disturbance
on
July
18
,
it
tracked
generally
northward
,
and
strengthened
to
attain
peak
winds
of
60
mph
(
95
km/h
)
under
generally
favorable
conditions
.


After
turning
to
the
northeast
,

weakened
over
cooler
waters
.


On
July
21
it
struck
the
island
of
Nantucket
,
and
shortly
thereafter
it
became
extratropical
.


The
extratropical
remnants
continued
northeastward
through
Nova
Scotia
,
and
on
July
22
it
merged
with
an
approaching

on
eastern
Cuba
on
September
8
.


The
hurricane
weakened
prior
to
continuing
into
the
Gulf
of
Mexico
,
but
increased
its
intensity
by
the
time
of
its
final
landfall
on
Galveston
,
Texas
on
September
13
,
before
becoming
an
extratropical
storm
on

.


The
remnants
of
Ike
continued
to
track
across
the
United
States
and
into
Canada
,
causing
considerable
damage
inland
,
before
dissipating
on
the
next
day
.


Ike
was
blamed
for
at
least
195
deaths
.


Of
these
deaths
,
74

in
Haiti
,
which
was
already
trying
to
recover
from
the
impact
of
three

still
missing
as
of
August
2011
.


Due
to
its
immense
size
,
Ike
caused
devastation
from
the
Louisiana
coastline
all
the
way
to
the
Kenedy
County
region
near
Corpus

,
amounting
to
a
total
of
at
least
$
38

.


At
the
time
,
the
hurricane
was
the
second-costliest
in
United

history
;
it
was
later
surpassed
by
Hurricanes
Sandy
(
2012
)
,
Harvey
(

Midwest
Express
Airlines
Flight
105
(
YX105/MEP105
)
was
a
scheduled
domestic
passenger
flight
which
crashed
into
an
open
field
in
Milwaukee
,
Wisconsin
shortly
after
taking
off
from
General
Mitchell
International
Airport
on
6
September
1985
.


The
airplane
,
a
Douglas
DC-9-14
twin
engine
jet
operated
by
Midwest
Express
Airlines
,
was
carrying
31
passengers
and
crew
.


None
of
them
survived
the
crash
.


Multiple
eyewitnesses
reported
that
the
plane
was
on
fire
shortly
after
it
took
off
from
the
airport
.


The
fire
was
caused
due
to
a
failure
on
the
right
engine
where
one
of
its
removable
sleeve
spacers
detached
.


The
removable
sleeve
spacer
suffered
metal
fatigue
which
caused
the
engine
to
explode
.


The
National
Transportation
Safety
Board
,
the
investigation
team
who
was
responsible
for
the
investigation
of
the
crash
,
concluded
that
despite
the
plane
suffering
engine
failure
,
the
response
of
the
crew
to
the
failure
was
the
main
cause
of
the
accident
.


The
crew
did
n't
properly
control
the
plane
during
the
emergency
.


Breakdown
of
the
crew
's
coordination
also
contributed
the
crash
.


Typhoon

.


It
was
the
tenth
named
storm
and
the
fourth
typhoon
of
the
2014
Pacific
typhoon
season
.


The
typhoon
is
believed
to
be
one
of
the
main
reasons
behind
the
crash
of
TransAsia
Airways
Flight
222
,
which
occurred
a
day
after
it
made
landfall
.


There
were
fifty-four

were
reported
to
be
children
)
and
a
crew
of
four
.


``
Taiwan

''
reported
that
``
first
suspicions
hinted
''
the
accident
might
be
related
to
Matmo
.


The
typhoon
developed
from
a
cluster
of
thundershowers
consolidating
around
an
area
of
low
pressure
in
the
doldrums
.


It
initially
followed
a
westward
track
,
then
made
a
sharp
northwest
turn
before
making
landfall
on
Taiwan
,
and
then
China
.


After
moving
further
inland
,
Matmo
slowly
curved
back
northeastwards
and
became
extratropical
before
its
remnants
affected
the
Korean
Peninsula
.


The
typhoon
caused
damage
of
US
$
418
million
and
there
were
65
deaths
related
to
the
storm
.


Matmo
brought
tropical

force
winds
and
heavy
rainfall
to
the
Philippines
,
typhoon
force
winds
and
torrential
rainfall
to
China
and
Taiwan
and
heavy

For
a
period
of
time
beginning
on
December
5
,
Rumbia
reorganized
and
strengthened
back
to
tropical
storm
intensity
before
wind
shear
began
to
weaken
the
system
.


Located
south
of
Vietnam
on
December
7
,
the
storm
's
circulation
center
became
devoid
of
convection
,
and
by
then
Rumbia
was
declared
by
the
JTWC
to
have
dissipated
.


In
the
Philippines
,
Rumbia
caused
roughly
US
$
1
million
in
damage
and
48
fatalities
.


Several
transportation
routes
were
suspended
in
the
lead-up
to
the
storm
's
landfall
.


As
a
result
of
the
tropical
storm
,
power
outages
occurred
,
especially
in
Surigao
.


Several
towns
and
villages
were
flooding
,
displacing
around
70,000
people
and
putting
4,100
people
into
temporary
emergency
sheltering

The
Sturgis
Motorcycle
Rally
is
an
American
motorcycle
rally
held
annually
in
Sturgis
,
South
Dakota
,
for
ten
days
usually
starting
the
first
Friday
in
August
.


In
2015
the
city
of
Sturgis
officially
expanded
the
dates
to
have
the
rally
start
on
the
Friday
before
the
first
full
week
of
August
and
end
on
the
second
Sunday
.


In
2016
,
Sturgis
City
Council
passed
a
resolution
to
begin
the
Rally
on
the
first
Friday
in
August
every
year
.


It
was
begun
in
1938
by
a
group
of
Indian
Motorcycle
riders
and
was
originally
held
for
stunts
and
races
.


Attendance
has
historically
been
around
500,000
people
,
reaching
a
high
of
over
700,000
in
2015
.


The

800
million
in
revenue
.


On
29
July
1967
,
a
fire
broke
out
on
board
the
aircraft
carrier
after
an
electrical
anomaly
caused
a
Zuni
rocket
on
a
F-4B
Phantom
to
fire
,
striking
an
external
fuel
tank
of
an
A-4
Skyhawk
.


The
flammable
jet
fuel
spilled
across
the
flight
deck
,
ignited
,
and
triggered
a
chain-reaction
of
explosions
that
killed
134
sailors
and
injured
161
.


At
the
time
,
``
Forrestal
''
was
engaged
in
combat
operations
in
the
Gulf
of
Tonkin
,
during
the
Vietnam
War
.


The
ship
survived
,
but
with
damage
exceeding
US
$
72
million
,
not
including
the
damage
to
aircraft
.


Future
United
States
Senator
John
McCain
and
future
four-star
admiral
and
U.S.
Pacific
Fleet
Commander
Ronald
J.
Zlatoper
were
among
the
survivors
.


Lt.
Tom
Treanore
returned
to
the
ship
as
its
commander
and
retired
an
admiral
.


The
disaster
prompted
the
Navy
to
revise
its
fire
fighting
practices
.


It
also
modified
its
weapon
handling
procedures
and
installed
a
deck
wash
down
system
on
all
carriers
.


the
newly
established

who
was
among
the
first

The
attack
on
Yokosuka
was
an
air
raid
conducted
by
the
United
States
Navy
on
18
July
1945
during
the
last
weeks
of
the
Pacific
War
.


The
Japanese
battleship
``
Nagato
''
was
the
raid
's
main
target
,
though
anti-aircraft
positions
and
other
warships
at
Yokosuka
Naval
Arsenal
were
also
attacked
.


Other
U.S.
Navy
and
Royal
Navy
aircraft
struck
airfields
in
the
Tokyo
area
.


While
``
Nagato
''
was
only
lightly
damaged
,
the
American
aircraft
sank
a
destroyer
,
a
submarine
and
two
escort
vessels
and
damaged
five
small
vessels
.


The
Allied
pilots
also
claimed
the
destruction
of
several
locomotives
and
43
Japanese
aircraft
as
well
as
damage
to
another
77
aircraft
.


Japanese
anti-aircraft
guns
shot
down
twelve
American
and
two
British
aircraft
.


The
Carnatic
Wars
(
also
spelled
Karnatic
Wars
)
were
a
series
of
military
conflicts
in
the
middle
of
the
18th
century
in
India
.


The
conflicts
involved
numerous
nominally
independent
rulers
and
their
vassals
,
struggles
for
succession
and
territory
,
and
included
a
diplomatic
and
military
struggle
between
the
French
East
India
Company
and
the
British
East
India
Company
.


They
were
mainly
fought
within
the
territories
of
Mughal
India
with
the
assistance
of
various
fragmented
polities
loyal
to
the
``
Great
Moghul
''
.


As
a
result
of
these
military
contests
,
the
British
East
India
Company
established
its
dominance
among
the
European
trading
companies
within
India
.


The
French
company
was
pushed
to
a
corner
and
was
confined
primarily
to
Pondichéry
.


The
East
India
Company
's
dominance
eventually
led
to
control
by
the
British
Company
over
most
of
India
and
eventually
to
the
establishment
of
the
British
Raj
.


In
the
18th
century
,
the
coastal
Carnatic
region
was
a
dependency
of
Hyderabad
.


Three
Carnatic
Wars
were
fought
between
1746
and
1763
.


The
Orgreave
Train
Collision
occurred
on
13
December
1926
near
Orgreave
Colliery
signal
box
on
the
Great
Central
Railway
line
about
east
of
Sheffield
.


A
goods
train
had
collided
with
a
preceding
goods
train
on
the
same
line
,
and
the
wreckage
had
obstructed
the
adjacent
passenger
line
.


A
workman
's
train
,
known
as
a
paddy
mail
,
ran
into
the
wreckage
;
paddy
mails
were
workmans
'
trains
operated
in
connection
with
all
three
shift
changes
at
the
collieries
.


These
were
hauled
from
Sheffield
Victoria
,
as
far
as
Orgreaves
Colliery
Sidings
by
the
main
line
company
,
using
whatever
locomotive
was
available
.


at
this
point
the
colliery
's
own
locomotives
took
over
and
in
connection
with
this
operation
unk

was
fitted
with
vacuum
brakes
.


The
train
then
ran
to
Orgreave
Colliery
platform
and
Treeton
Colliery
.


The
Northeastern
United
States
blizzard
of
1978
was
a
catastrophic
,
historic
nor'easter
that
struck
New
England
,
New
Jersey
,
and
the
New
York
metropolitan
area
.


The
``
Blizzard
of
'78
''
formed
on
Sunday
,
February
5
,
1978
,
and
broke
up
on
February
7
.


the
storm
was
primarily
known
as
``
storm
larry
''
in
connecticut
,
following
the
local
convention
promoted
by
the
travelers
weather
service
on
television
and
radio
stations
there
.


Snow
fell
mostly
from
Monday
morning
,
February
6
,
to
the
evening
of
Tuesday
,
February
7
.


Connecticut
,
Rhode
Island
,
and
Massachusetts
were
hit
especially
hard
by
this
storm
.


Boston
received
a
record-breaking
of
snow
;
Providence
also
broke
a
record
,
with
of
snow
;
Atlantic
City
broke
an
all-time
storm
accumulation
,
with
.


Nearly
all
economic
activity
was
disrupted
in
the
worst-hit
areas
.


The
storm
killed
about
100
people
in
the
Northeast
and
injured
about
4,500
.


It
caused
more
than

The
2010
Canterbury
earthquake
(
also
known
as
the
Darfield
earthquake
)
struck
the
South
Island
of
New
Zealand
with
a
moment
magnitude
of
7.1
at
on
,
and
had
a
maximum
perceived
intensity
of
X
(
``
Extreme
''
)
on
the
Mercalli
intensity
scale
.


Some
damaging
aftershocks
followed
the
main
event
,
the
strongest
of
which
was
a
magnitude
6.3
shock
known
as
the
Christchurch
earthquake
that
occurred
nearly
six
months
later
on
22
February
2011
.


Because
this
aftershock
was
centred
very
close
to
Christchurch
,
it
was
much
more
destructive
and
resulted
in
the
deaths
of
185
people
.


The
earthquake
on
4
September
caused
widespread
damage
and
several
power
outages
,
particularly
in
the
city
of
Christchurch
,
New
Zealand
's
second
largest
city
.


Two
residents
were
seriously
injured
,
one
by
a
collapsing
chimney
and
a
second
by
flying
glass
.


One
person
died
of
a
heart
attack
suffered
during
the
quake
,
although
this
could
not
be
directly
linked
to
the
earthquake
.


Mass
fatalities
were
avoided
partly
due
to
there
being
few
houses
of
unreinforced
construction
,
although
this
was
also
aided
by
the
quake
occurring
during
the
early
hours
of
the
morning
when
most
people
were
off
the
street
.


The
earthquake
's
epicentre
was
west
of
Christchurch
,
close
to
the
town
of
Darfield
.


The
hypocentre
was
at
a
depth
of
10
km
.


A
foreshock
of
roughly
magnitude
5.8
hit
five
seconds
before
the
main
quake
,
and
strong
aftershocks
were
reported
,
up
to
magnitude
5.4
.


The
quake
was
felt
as
lasting
up
to
40
seconds
,
and
was
felt
widely
across
the
South
Island
,
and
in
the
North
Island
as
far
north
as
New
Plymouth
.


As
the
epicentre
was
on
land
away
from
the
coast
,
no
tsunami
occurred
.


The
National
Crisis
Management
Centre
in
the
basement
of
the
Beehive
in
Wellington
was
activated
,
and
Civil
Defence
declared
a
state
of
emergency
for
Christchurch
,
the
Selwyn
District
,
and
the
Waimakariri
District
,
while
Selwyn
District
,
Waimakariri
and
Timaru
activated
their
emergency
operation
centres
.


Initially
,
a
curfew
was
established
for
parts
of
Christchurch
Central
City
from
7
pm
to
7
am
in
response
to
the
earthquake
.


The
New
Zealand
Army
was
deployed
to
the
worst
affected
areas
in
Canterbury
.


Insurance
claims
totalled
between
NZ
$
2.75
and
$
3.5
billion
,
although
it
is
unclear
how
much
cost
can
be
attributed
to
each
of
the
earthquake
events
in
the
2010–2011
Canterbury
earthquake
sequence
.


The
total
estimated
damage
bill
was
up
to
$
40
billion
,
making
it
the
fifth-biggest
insurance
event
in
the
world
since
1953
.


Hurricane
Carlotta
was
the
easternmost
tropical
cyclone
in
the
Eastern
Pacific
to
make
landfall
at
hurricane
intensity
since
1966
.


The
third
tropical
cyclone
and
third
named
storm
of
the
2012
Pacific
hurricane
season
,
Carlotta
developed
slowly
into
a
tropical
depression
from
a
tropical
wave
southwest
of
Central
America
on
June
14
.


It
moved
generally
west-northwestward
and
by
the
following
day
,
strengthened
into
tropical
storm
strength
.


Thereafter
,
gradual
intensification
occurred
and
the
storm
reached
hurricane
strength
on
June
15
.


Rapid
intensification
ensued
further
,
as
Carlotta
peaked
as
a
110
mph
(
175
km/h
)
Category
2
hurricane
on
the
same
day
.


at
0100
utc
the
following
day
,
carlotta
made
landfall
near
puerto
escondido
,
the
easternmost
landfalling
pacific
hurricane
in
recorded
history
at
the
time
.


The
next
day
the
storm
began
to
weaken
as
it
moved
onshore
Southwestern
Mexico
.


Carlotta
continued
to
weaken
rapidly
,
eventually
dissipating
on
June
16
.


Throughout
Mexico
,
widespread
power
outages
and
wind
damage
was
reported
,
particularly
in
Oaxaca
.


Infrastructural
damage
was
also
reported
due
to
winds
and
rain
,
as
well
as
damage
to
crops
.


Rainfall
from
Carlotta
peaked
at
13.78
in
(
35.0
cm
)
in
San
Juan
Bautista
Tuxtepec
.


Numerous
mudslides
resulted
from
the
heavy
rains
,
which
blocked
roads
and
damaged
structures
.


at
least
29,000
homes
and
2,500
businesses
sustained
damage
from
carlotta
,
mostly
in
oaxaca
.


Seven
people
were
killed
by
Carlotta
,
and
the
state
of
Oaxaca
requested
MX
$
1.44
billion
(
US
$
113
million
)
for
repairs
to
public
infrastructure
.


Operation
Juno
was
a
German
naval
offensive
late
in
the
Norwegian
Campaign
.


The
German
ships
involved
were
the
battleships
and
,
the
heavy
cruiser
and
the
destroyers
,
,
and
.


The
mission
was
launched
on
8
June
1940
,
as
an
attack
on
Harstad
to
relieve
pressure
on
the
German
garrison
at
Narvik
.


After
refuelling
at
Jan
Mayen
Island
the
mission
became
unnecessary
as
the
Allies
were
evacuating
from
Norway
.


On
his
own
initiative
,
however
,
the
German
commander
,
Admiral
Marschall
,
decided
to
seek
and
destroy
the
Allied
transports
.


The
troop
transport
``
Orama
''
,
the
tanker
``
Oil
Pioneer
''
and
the
minesweepeing
trawler
were
sunk
.


Marschall
ordered
the
``
Admiral
Hipper
''
and
the
destroyers
to
Trondheim
,
where
they
arrived
in
the
morning
of
9
June
.


The
next
day
,
``
Admiral
Hipper
''
attempted
to
leave
Trondheim
,
but
was
forestalled
by
the
sighting
of
a
British
submarine
.


World
War
II
in
Yugoslav
Macedonia
started
with
the
Axis
occupation
of
Yugoslavia
.


Macedonian
communist
Partisans
of
the
People
's
Liberation
Army
of
Macedonia
,
part
of
the
Yugoslav
Partisan
movement
,
started
a
political
and
military
campaign
on
11
October
1941
to
resist
the
occupation
of
Vardar
Macedonia
by
Bulgarian
,
German
,
Italian
,
and
Albanian
forces
.


Officially
,
the
area
was
called
then
Vardar
Banovina
,
because
the
very
name
``
Macedonia
''
was
prohibited
in
the
Kingdom
of
Yugoslavia
.


Initially
it
had
no
real
success
,
starting
to
grow
only
in
1943
with
the
capitulation
of
Italy
and
the
Soviet
victories
over
Nazi
Germany
.


The
role
of
the
Bulgarian
communists
,
which
avoided
organizing
mass
armed
resistance
,
was
also
a
key
factor
.


their
influence
over
the
macedonian
party
organization
remained
dominant
until
the
spring
of
1943
when
tito
's
special
emissary
svetozar
unk
arrived
in
macedonia
.


This
led
to
the
rise
of
younger
generation
anti-Bulgarian
oriented
partisan
leaders
,
who
were
loyal
to
Yugoslavia
.


In
the
western
part
of
the
area
,
the
Albanian
Partisans
also
participated
in
the
resistance
movement
.


After
Bulgaria
switched
sides
in
the
war
in
September
1944
,
the
Bulgarian

in
Macedonia

borders
of
Bulgaria
.


In
the
early
October
the
newly
formed
Bulgarian
People
's
Army
together
with
the
Red
Army
reentered
occupied
Yugoslavia
to
blocking
the
German
forces
withdrawing
from
Greece
.


Vardar
Macedonia
was
liberated
in
end
of
November
when
communist
Yugoslavia
was
established
.


The
operation
was
called
the
National
Liberation
War
of
Macedonia
(
)
by
the
Partisans
,
in
line
with
the
greater
Yugoslav
People
's
Liberation
War
,
but
combatants
also
developed
further
aspirations
over
the
geographic
region
of
Macedonia
.


It
marked
the
defeat
of
Bulgarian
nationalism
and
the
victory
of
Macedonism
in
the
area
.


The
Lithuanian
partisans
(
)
were
partisans
who
waged
a
guerrilla
warfare
in
Lithuania
against
the
Soviet
Union
in
1944–1953
.


Similar
anti-Soviet
resistance
groups
,
also
known
as
Forest
Brothers
and
cursed
soldiers
,
fought
against
Soviet
rule
in
Estonia
,
Latvia
,
Poland
,
Romania
and
Galicia
.


It
is
estimated
that
a
total
of
30,000
Lithuanian
partisans
and
their
supporters
were
killed
.


at
the
end
of
world
war
ii
,
the
red
army
pushed
the
eastern
front
towards
lithuania
.


The
Soviets
invaded
and
occupied
Lithuania
by
the
end
of
1944
.


As
forced
conscription
into
Red
Army
and
Stalinist
repressions
intensified
,
thousands
of
Lithuanians
used
forests
in
the
countryside
as
a
natural
refuge
.


these
spontaneous
groups
became
more
organized
and
centralized
culminating
in
the
establishment
of
the
union
of
lithuanian
freedom
fighters
in
february
1948
.


In
their
documents
,
the
partisans
emphasized
that
their
ultimate
goal
is
recreation
of
independent
Lithuania
.


As
the
partisan
war
continued
,
it
became
clear
that
the
West
would
not
interfere
in
Eastern
Europe
(
see
Western
betrayal
)
and
that
the
partisans
had
no
chance
of
success
against
the
far
stronger
opponent
.


Eventually
,
the
partisans
made
an
explicit
and
conscious
decision
not
to
accept
any
new
members
.


The
leadership
of
the
partisans
was
destroyed
in
1953
thus
effectively
ending
the
partisan
war
,
though
individual
fighters
held
out
until
the
1960s
.

Hurricane
Gabrielle
was
a
powerful
tropical
cyclone
that
caused
nine
fatalities
in
the
United
States
and
Canada
,
despite
remaining
hundreds
of
miles
offshore
.


The
tenth
tropical
cyclone
,
seventh
named
storm
,
and
third
hurricane
of
the
1989
Atlantic
hurricane
season
,
Gabrielle
developed
on
August
30
from
a
tropical
wave
near
the
west
coast
of
Africa
.


under
favorable
conditions
,
the
depression
intensified
and
became
tropical
storm
gabrielle
early
on
the
following
day
.


Rapid
strengthening
occurred
thereafter
,
with
Gabrielle
reaching
hurricane
intensity
early
on
September
1
.


After
becoming
a
hurricane
,
further
intensification
was
steady
,
though
by
September
5
,
Gabrielle
peaked
as
a
moderate
Category
4
hurricane
.


On
the
following
day
,
Gabrielle
began
to
slowly
level-off
in
intensity
,
while
gradually
curving
northward
.


After
weakening
to
a
Category
2
hurricane
,
the
storm
passed
east
of
Bermuda
on
September
8
.


Gabrielle
eventually
decelerated
,
and
by
early
on
September
10
,
it
curved
westward
and
weakened
to
a
tropical
storm
.


Gabrielle
re-curved
northeastward
on
September
11
and
began
paralleling
Nova
Scotia
.


It
further
weakened
to
a
tropical
depression
on
September
12
and
was
then
absorbed
by
a
developing
storm
near
Newfoundland
on
September
13
.


Due
to
its
large
size
,
Gabrielle
produced
swells
and
high
tides
in
the
Lesser
Antilles
,
Bermuda
,
the
East
Coast
of
the
United
States
,
and
Atlantic
Canada
.


Rough
seas
along
the
East

caused
one
fatality
in

two
in
Massachusetts
,
one
in

,
and
four
in

the
1982
florida

officially
known
as
subtropical
storm
one
,
was
the
only
subtropical
cyclone
of
the
inactive
1982
atlantic
hurricane
season
.


The
storm
originated
from
two
different
systems
around
the
Gulf
of
Mexico
and
Caribbean
Sea
on
June
16
.


The
systems
merged
into
trough
while
a
circulation
began
to
form
off
the
coast
of
Florida
on
June
18
.


The
depression
made
landfall
in
Florida
and
strengthened
into
a
storm
over
land
.


The
storm
entered
the
Atlantic
Ocean
and
headed
to
the
northeast
,
becoming
extratropical
on
June
20
near
Newfoundland
.


The
storm
was
the
only
system
of
1982
to
affect
the
eastern
half
of
the
United
States
,
and
it
caused

and
vietnam
in
july
2003
.


The
eighth
tropical
storm
in
the
western
Pacific
that
year
,
Koni
originated
from
a
disturbance
situated
within
the
monsoon
trough
well
east
of
the
Philippines
on
July
15
.


Tracking
westward
,
intensification
was
slow
and
the
system
remained
a
tropical
depression
as
it
moved
across
the
central
Philippines
on
July
17
.


upon
moving
into
the
south
china
sea
,
however
,
conditions
allowed
for
quicker
strengthening
,
and
as
such
the
cyclone
reached
tropical
storm
status
on
july
18
before
reaching
its
peak
intensity
with
maximum
sustained
winds
of
110
km/h
(
70
mph
)
and
a
minimum
barometric
pressure
of
975
mbar
(
hpa
;
28.79
inhg
)
,
making
it
a
severe
tropical
storm
.


However
,
atmospheric
conditions
began
to
deteriorate
as
Koni
made
landfall
on
Hainan
on
July
21
,
weakening
the
system
.


The
tropical
storm
continued
to
weaken
as
it
moved
over
the
Gulf
of
Tonkin
prior
to
a
final
landfall
near
Hanoi
,
Vietnam
the
following
day
.


Tracking
inland
,
the
combination
of
land
interaction
and
wind
shear
caused
Koni
to
dissipate
over
Laos
on
July
23
.


Shortly
after
development
Koni
tracked
through
the
Philippines
,
killing
two
people
.


After
moving
into
the
South
China
Sea
,
turbulence
produced
by
the
storm
resulted
in
an
aviation
incident
involving
a
commercial
airliner
off
the
western
Philippines
.


Three
of
the
plane
's
occupants
received
minor
injuries
.


In
Hainan
,
Koni
caused
heavy
rainfall
,
peaking
at
189
mm
(
7.44
in
)
at
a
station
on
Wuzhi
Mountain
.


The
rains
resulted
in
the
collapse
of
1,400
homes
and
an
estimated
CN¥140.27
million
(
US
$
16.9
million
)
in
direct
economic
losses
.


Effects
were
worst
in
Vietnam
,
where
three
people
were
killed
.


Widespread
power
outages
occurred
,
and
strong
winds
resulted
in
agricultural
and
infrastructural
damage
,

typhoon
mary
,
also
nicknamed
``
bloody
mary
''
by
the
joint
typhoon
warning
center
(
jtwc
)
,
was
an
extremely
damaging
storm
that
was
part
of
the
1960
pacific
typhoon
season
.


It
began
as
a
circulation
in
a
trough
in
the
South
China
Sea
.


A
tropical
depression
formed
on
June
2
,
as
it
was
traveling
clockwise
.


It
became
a
tropical
storm
on
the
next
day
,
and
received
the
name
``
Mary
''
.


It
slowly
moved
across
the
sea
,
strengthening
to
a
typhoon
.


Mary
made
landfall
in
Hong
Kong
on
June
8
,
and
moved
through
Guangdong
and
Fujian
.


It
reemerged
back
to
the
Pacific
Ocean
,
and
restrengthened
into
a
typhoon
temporarily
.


It
then
traveled
east
,
weakening
and
becoming
extratropical
on
June
12
.


Mary
caused
a
significant
amount
of
damage
in
Hong
Kong
and
China
.


It
was
considered
the
worst
storm
to
hit
Hong
Kong
since
the
typhoon
in
1937
.


The
storm
destroyed
weak
shacks
made
by
refugees
from
the
mainland
,
leaving
thousands
homeless
.


There
were
multiple
landslides
,
and
most
of
the
infrastructure
were
damaged
.


More
than
400
small
watercraft
were
either
damaged
or
destroyed
.


In
China
,
dikes
and
dams

Occupy
Central
was
an
occupation
protest
,
which
took
place
in
Central
,
Hong
Kong
and
lasted
from
15
October
2011
to
11
September
2012
.


The
camp
was
set
up
at
a
plaza
beneath
the
HSBC
headquarters
.


On
13
August
2012
,
the
High
Court
granted
an
injunction
against
the
continuation
of
the
protest
,
and
ordered
the
occupants
to
leave
by
9
p.m.
on
27
August

protesters
defied
the
order
and
remained
in
place
until
15
days
after
the
deadline
,
when
court
bailiffs
were
sent
to
evict
the
occupants
.

the
lengthiest
Occupy
movements
in
the
world
.


The
Occupy
movement
is
an
international
protest
movement
against
social
and
economic
inequality
,
its
primary
goal
being
to
make
the
economic
structure
and
power
relations
in
society
more
fair
.


Different
local
groups
have
different
foci
,
but
among
the
prime
concerns
is
the
claim
that
large
corporations
and
the
global
financial
system
control
the
world
in
a
way
that
disproportionately
benefits
a
minority
,
undermines
democracy
and
is
unstable
.

1914
during
the
Race
to
the
Sea
,
when
the
divisions
of
the
II
Bavarian
Corps
advanced
westwards
on
the

Butte
de
Warlencourt

which
was
captured
several
times
and
lost
to
German
counter-attacks
,
during
the
rest

Battle
of

to
be
the
foulest
sector
of
the

Operation
Jupiter
was
an
offensive
by
VIII
Corps
of
the
British
Second
Army
on
10
July
1944
during
the
Battle
of
Normandy
in
the
Second
World
War
.


The
objective
of
the
43rd
(
Wessex
)
Infantry
Division
(
Major-General
Ivo
Thomas
)
,
was
to
capture
the
villages
of
Baron-sur-Odon
,
Fontaine-Étoupefour
,
Chateau
de
Fontaine
and
to
recapture
Hill

Infantry
Division
would
take
Éterville
,
Maltot
and
the
ground
up
to
the
River
Orne
and
then
the
tanks
of
the
4th
Armoured
Brigade

by
infantry
,
would
advance
through
the
captured
ground
and
secure
several
villages
to
the
west
of
the
River
Orne
.


It
was
hoped
that
the
initial
objectives
could
be
captured
by
after
which
the
4th
Armoured
Brigade
would
exploit
the
success
.


The
British
advance
went
well
at
first
but
fighting
for
Hill
112
took
all
day
and
Maltot
changed
hands
several
times
.

in
the
afternoon
,
forced
the
British
off
the
top
of
Hill
112
to
positions
on
the
north-facing
slope
.


The
operation
was
a
tactical
failure
for
VIII
Corps
but
a
strategic
success
for
the
Allies
,
attrition
having
reduced
the
II
SS
Panzer
Corps
to
a
condition
from
which
it
never
recovered
.


British
operations
of
the
Second
Battle
of
the
Odon
conducted
in
the
Odon
valley
continued
in
July
and
the
53rd
(
Welsh
)
Infantry
Division
occupied
Hill

almost
unopposed
on

by
mainly
Imperial
Japanese
Army
troops
against
United
States
Army
forces
during
the

Georgia
Campaign

Japanese
counterattack
was
to
destroy
the
American

by
attacking
their
exposed
flank
and
rear
areas

The
Japanese
succeeded
in

attacking
several
isolated
outposts
in
the
American
rear
areas
,
but
failed
to
inflict
significant
casualties
on
the
American
forces

the
Japanese
counterattack
was
defeated
,

allies
captured

The
Siege
of
Port
Royal
in
1707
was
two
separate
attempts
by
English
colonists
from
New
England
to
conquer
Acadia
(
roughly
the
present-day
Canadian
provinces
of
Nova
Scotia
and
New
Brunswick
)
by
capturing
its
capital
Port
Royal
(
now
Annapolis
Royal
)
during
Queen
Anne
's
War
.


Both
attempts
were
made
by
colonial
militia
,
and
were
led
by
men
inexperienced
in
siege
warfare
.


Led
by
Acadian
Governor
Daniel
d'Auger
de
Subercase
,
the
French
troops
at
Port
Royal
easily
withstood
both
attempts
,
assisted
by
irregular
Acadians
and
the
Wabanaki
Confederacy
outside
the
fort
.


The
first
siege
began
on
June
6
,
1707
,
and
lasted
11
days
.


The
English
colonel
,
John
March
,
was
able
to
establish
positions
near
Port
Royal
's
fort
,
but
his
engineer
claimed
the
necessary
cannons
could
not
be
landed
,
and
the
force
withdrew
amid
disagreements
in
the
war
council
.


The
second
siege
began
August
22
,
and
was
never
able
to
establish
secure
camps
,
owing
to
spirited
defensive
sorties
organized
by
Acadian
Governor
Daniel
d'Auger
de
Subercase
.


The
siege
attempts
were
viewed
as
a
debacle
in
Boston
,
and
the
expedition
's
leaders
were
jeered
upon
their
return
.


Port
Royal
was
captured
in
1710
by
a
larger
force
that
included
British
Army
troops
;
that
capture
marked
the
end
of
French
rule
in
peninsular
Acadia
.


The
1986
Chalfant
Valley
earthquake
struck
southern
Mono
County
near
Bishop
and
Chalfant
,
California
at
Pacific
Daylight
Time
on
July
21
.


With
a
moment
magnitude
of
6.2
and
a
maximum
Mercalli
intensity
of
VI
(
``
Strong
''
)
,
the
shock
injured
two
people
and
caused
property
damage
estimated
at
$
2.7
million
in
the
affected
areas
.


There
was
a
significant
foreshock
and
aftershock
sequence
that
included
a
few
moderate
events
,
and
was
the
last
in
a
series
of
three
earthquakes
that
affected
southern
California
and
the
northern
Owens
Valley
in
July
1986
.


Strong
motion
stations
at
the
Long
Valley
Dam
and
an
instrumented
building
in
Bishop
captured
light
to
moderate
readings
from
the
event
.


The
faulting
reached
the
surface
of
the
ground
,
but
the
maximum
amount
of
measurable
slip
was
limited
to
about
of
strike-slip
motion
along
the
White
Mountain
Fault
Zone
.


Other
destructive
and
surface-rupturing
earthquakes
,
as
well
as
large
volume
volcanic
eruptions
,
have
occurred
in
the
area
.


although
the
series
of
shocks
occurred
within
the
white
mountain
seismic
gap
,
the
region
continues
to
have
potential
for
a
very
large
earthquake
.


The
2011
Champions
League
Twenty20
was
the
third
edition
of
the
Champions
League
Twenty20
,
an
international
Twenty20
cricket
tournament
.


It
was
held
in
India
from
19
September
to
9
October
2011
.


It
was
the
first
edition
after
Nokia
replaced
Bharti
Airtel
as
the
tournament
's
title
sponsor
.


The
defending
champions
were
the
Chennai

.


The
Mumbai
Indians
emerged
the
winners
of
the
tournament
,
defeating
the
Royal

in
the
final
.


David
Warner
from
the

.


Hurricane
Dora
was
the
strongest
tropical
cyclone
in
the
northeastern
Pacific
in
2011
.


Dora
developed
from
a
tropical
wave
south
of
Honduras
on
July
18
.


Moving
northwestward
in
favorable
conditions
,
the
system
quickly
intensified
to
tropical
storm
status
and
attained
hurricane
intensity
the
next
day
.


Rapid
intensification
ensued
shortly
thereafter
,
bringing
the
storm
to
its
peak
intensity
on
July
21
as
a
Category
4
hurricane
,
with
a
minimum
barometric
pressure
of
929
mbar
(
hPa
;
27.43
inHg
)
and
maximum
sustained
winds
of
155
mph
(
250
km/h
)
.


However
,
the
storm
's
path
into
an
area
with
cool
sea
surface
temperatures
and
wind
shear
caused
Dora
to
quickly
deteriorate
and
weaken
.


By
July
24
,
Dora
had
degenerated
into
a
remnant
low-pressure
area
west
of
the
Baja
California
Peninsula
.


Dora
brought
stormy
conditions
to
the
southwestern
Mexico
coast
and
the
Baja
California
Peninsula
throughout
its
existence
.


Remaining
off
the
coast
from
its
formation
to
dissipation
,
Dora
's
effects
on
land
were
slight
.


However
,
the
outer
rainbands
of
the
hurricane
caused
flooding
and
mudslides
in
southern
Mexico
and
Guatemala
,
while
rough
surf
toppled
a
lighthouse
and
damaged
60
restaurants
along
the
coast
.


The
hurricane
's
remnants
contributed
to
heightened
shower
and
thunderstorm
activity
across
New
Mexico
and
Arizona
in
late
July
.


The
Second
Sudanese
Civil
War
was
a
conflict
from
1983
to
2005
between
the
central
Sudanese
government
and
the
Sudan
People
's
Liberation
Army
.


It
was
largely
a
continuation
of
the
First
Sudanese
Civil
War
of
1955
to
1972
.


although
it
originated
in
southern
sudan
,
the
civil
war
spread
to
the
nuba
mountains
and
the
blue
nile
.


It
lasted
for
22
years
and
is
one
of
the
longest
civil
wars
on
record
.


The
war
resulted
in
the
independence
of
South
Sudan
six
years
after
the
war
ended
.


Roughly
two
million
people
died
as
a
result
of
war
,
famine
and
disease
caused
by
the
conflict
.


Four
million
people
in
southern
Sudan
were
displaced
at
least
once
(
and
normally
repeatedly
)
during
the
war
.


The
civilian
death
toll
is
one
of
the
highest
of
any
war
since
World
War
II
and
was
marked
by
numerous
human
rights
violations
.


These
include
slavery
and
mass
killings
.


Typhoon
Dujuan
,
known
in
the
Philippines
as
Typhoon
Onyok
,
was
the
strongest
tropical
cyclone
to
strike
the
Pearl
River
delta
since
Typhoon
Hope
in
1979
.


The
13th
storm
and
7th
typhoon
of
the
2003
Pacific
typhoon
season
,
Dujuan
developed
on
August
27
to
the
east
of
Taiwan
.


It
initially
moved
to
the
northwest
,
slowly
intensifying
into
a
tropical
storm
while
drawing
moisture
and
rainfall
over
the
Philippines
.


On
the
island
of
Luzon
,
one
person
was
killed
and
areas
were
flooded
.


Dujuan
quickly
intensified
after
turning
and
moving
quicker
to
the
west-northwest
,
developing
an
eye
.


It
reached
peak
winds
of
150
km/h
(
90
mph
)
on
September
1
,
and
shortly
thereafter
passed
just
south
of
Taiwan
.


There
,
Dujuan
left
590,000
people
without
power
,
killed
three
,
and
caused
NT
$
200
million
(
NWD
,
$
115
million
USD
)
in
crop
damage
.


While
moving
through
the
South
China
Sea
,
the
typhoon
developed
concentric
eyewalls
.


Dujuan
weakened
to
severe
tropical
storm
status
before
making
landfall
on
September
2
in
southern
China
,
just
east
of
Hong
Kong
near
Shenzhen
,
Guangdong
.


The
storm
dissipated
the
next
day
after
causing
40
deaths
and
¥2.3
billion
(
CNY
,
$
277
million
USD
)
in
damage
.


Most
of
the
deaths
were
in
Shenzhen
where
the
storm
moved
ashore
,
and
the
city
experienced
a
near-total
power
outage
.


Hurricane
Linda
was
the
second-strongest
eastern
Pacific
hurricane
on
record
.


Forming
from
a
tropical
wave
on
September
9
,
1997
,
Linda
steadily
intensified
and
reached
hurricane
status
within
36
hours
of
developing
.


The
storm
rapidly
intensified
,
reaching
sustained
winds
of
185
mph
(
295
km/h
)
and
an
estimated
central
pressure
of
;
both
were
records
for
the
eastern
Pacific
until
Hurricane
Patricia
surpassed
them
in
2015
.


The
hurricane
was
briefly
forecast
to
move
toward
southern
California
,
but
instead
,
it
turned
out
to
sea
and
lost
its
status
as
a
tropical
cyclone
on
September
17
,
before
dissipating
on
September
21
.


Linda
was
the
fifteenth
tropical
cyclone
,
thirteenth
named
storm
,
seventh
hurricane
,
and
fifth
major
hurricane
of
the
1997
Pacific
hurricane
season
.


While
near
peak
intensity
,
Hurricane
Linda
passed
near
Socorro
Island
,
where
it
damaged
meteorological
instruments
.


The
hurricane
produced
high
waves
along
the
southwestern
Mexican
coastline
,
forcing
the
closure
of
five
ports
.


If
Linda
had
made
landfall
on
southern
California
as
predicted
,
it
would
have
been
the
strongest
storm
to
do
so
since
a
storm
in
1939
.


though
it
did
not
hit
the
state
,
the
hurricane
produced
light
to
moderate
rainfall
across
the
region
,
causing
mudslides
and
flooding
in
the
san
gorgonio
wilderness
;
two
houses
were
destroyed
and
77
others
were
damaged
,
and
damage
totaled
us
$
3.2
million
(
as
of
1997
;
value
$
5.2
million
as
of
2018
)
.


San
Felipe
Hurricane
was
the
second
tropical
cyclone
of
the
1876
Atlantic
hurricane
season
.


The
storm
was
first
observed
east
of
the
Leeward
Islands
on
September
12
,
later
intensifying
to
a
category
3
hurricane
while
approaching
Puerto
Rico
.


In
the
upcoming
days
,
the
storm
would
make
landfall
on
Hispaniola
and
Cuba
,
while
also
at
hurricane
intensity
.


Weakening
to
a
tropical
storm
,
it
crossed
the
island
until
emerging
over
central
Cuba
,
and
passing
just
east
of
Florida
.


The
storm
re-intensified
into
a
hurricane
and
struck
near
Wilmington
,
North
Carolina
as
a
minimal
hurricane
.


continuing
inland
,
the
san
felipe
hurricane
gradually
weakened
over
the
united
states
,
reaching
near
cape
cod
before
dissipation
on
september
19
.


The
San
Felipe
Hurricane
was
the
only
tropical
cyclone
in
the
season
to
result
in
fatalities
,
according
to
records
of
the

The
Edge
Festival
was
an
annual
music
festival
held
in
Edinburgh
,
Scotland
,
during
August
of
each
year
.


Formerly
known
as
T
on
the
Fringe
,
The
Edge
was
part
of
the
Edinburgh
Festival
Fringe
,
the
world
's
largest
arts
fringe
festival
(
to
the
larger
Edinburgh

)
.


Unlike
other
music
festivals
,
The
Edge
did
not
take
place
at
one
location
,
with
performers
instead
playing
numerous
venues
across
the
city
during
the
month
.


The
festival
was
founded
under
the
T
on
the
Fringe
name
by
DF
Concerts
and
Tennent
's
Lager
,
with
DF
continuing
to
promote
the
festival
after
the
departure
of
Tennent
's
from
2008
until
2012
.


The
festival
began
in
2000
,
with
fifteen
concerts
in
its
first
year
.


It
was
founded
by
Dave
Corbett
,
after
realising
the
lack
of
contemporary
music
taking
place
at
the
Edinburgh
Festival
.


since
2000
,
t
on
the
fringe
has
played
host
to
some
of
the
most
commercially
successful
artists
as
well
as
the
best
in
alternative
and
emerging
talent
.


over
the
years
the
event
has
seen
performances
by
the
likes
of
pixies
,
muse
,
morrissey
,
nancy
sinatra
,
franz
ferdinand
and
arcade
fire
.


The
2007
festival
featured
three
concerts
taking
place
at
the
25,000

,
a
record
for
the
festival
at
the
time
.

.


The
Championship
consisted
of
a
single

having
emerged
from
Ulster
unchallenged
.


As
a
consequence
,
Antrim

treated
as
defending
Ulster
Champions
despite
no
matches
taking
place
.


Antrim
emerged
victorious
by
41
points
to
12
.


The
exact
breakdown
of
the
final

has
been
lost
to
history
.


Antrim
advanced
to
the
semifinal
of
the
1901

where
they
were
defeated
by
Wexford

;
each

The

advanced
to
the

,
a
new

against
the
other

and
then
played
each

the
qualifiers
from
the
other

(
in
other
words
,
each
qualifier
from
Group
A
played
each
qualifier

The
Division
II
tournament
was
held
in
Maribor
,
Slovenia
,
from
March
25
to
31
for
Group
A
.


Group
B
was
contested
from
March
10
to
16
in
Seoul
,
South
Korea
.


In
both
tournaments
the
first
placed
team
was
promoted
and
the
last
placed
team
relegated
,
so
,
the
Group
B
winner
moved
up
to
Group
A
,
and
the
Group
A
winner
moved
up
to
Division
I
Group
B
.


The
last
placed
in
Group
A
was
relegated
to
Group
B
.


While
the
rules
stated
that
the
5th
and
6th
placed
teams
in
Group
B
must
enter
a
qualification
tournament
for
next
year
if
more
member
nations
apply
to
compete
,
this
did
not
happen
.


Previously
these
tournaments
were
known
as
Division

The
2009
Women
's
Hockey
Champions
Trophy
was
the
17th
edition
of
the
Hockey
Champions
Trophy
for
women
.


It
was
held
between
11–19
July
2009
in
Sydney
,
Australia
.


Argentina
won
the
tournament
for
the
third
time
after
defeating
Australia
4–3
in
the
final
on
penalty
strokes
after
a
0–0
draw
.


Despite
finishing
runner-up
,
Australia
were
relegated
from
next
year
's
tournament
instead
of
the
sixth-placed
team
England
,
due
to
England
being
the
host
of
the
2010
edition
.


Relegation
was
decided
based
on
rankings
from
the
2008
Olympics
.


Australian
coach
Frank
Murray
strongly
criticised
the
rule
,
calling
it
``
a
ridiculous
qualification
process
''
,
upon
discovering
prior
to
the
final
that
Australia
would
have
to
win
the
tournament
to
avoid
relegation
.


He
stated
that
the
tournament
's
lowest-placed
team
bar
the
next
hosts
should
instead
be
relegated
,
and
noted
that
the
rule
incentivised
Australia
to
deliberately
lose
to
England
,
to
help
England
to
finish
higher
than
sixth
.

it
was
the
28th
and
final
event
to
be
promoted
under
the
in

banner
,
as
shortly
thereafter
the
wwf
decided
to
give
their
monthly

permanent
names
;
backlash
became
the
name
for
the
unk

beginning
in
2000
and
retained
that
name
until
2009
,
before
being
resurrected
in
2016
(
albeit
after
summerslam
)
before
getting
back
to
the
unk
slot
the
following
year
.


The
concept
of
the

was
based
around
the
backlash
from
WWF
's
premiere

event
WrestleMania
.


As
such
,
the
main
event
was
a

from

Uruguay
v
Brazil
was
the
decisive
match
of
the
final
group
stage
at
the
1950
FIFA
World
Cup
.


The
match
was
played
at
the
Estádio
do
Maracanã
in
the
then-Brazilian
capital
of
Rio
de
Janeiro
on
16
July
1950
.


Unlike
other
World
Cups
,
the
1950
winner
was
determined
by
a
final
group
stage
,
with
the
final
four
teams
playing
in
round-robin
format
,
instead
of
a
knockout
stage
.


With
Brazil
one
point
ahead
of
Uruguay
going
into
the
match
,
Uruguay
needed
a
win
while
Brazil
needed
only
to
avoid
defeat
to
claim
the
title
of
world
champions
.


Brazil
took
the
lead
shortly
after
half-time
on
a
goal
by
Friaça
,
but
Juan
Alberto
Schiaffino
equalised
for
Uruguay
midway
through
the
half
.


Alcides
Ghiggia
scored
the
winning
goal
with
11
minutes
remaining
in
the
match
,
resulting
in
one
of
the
biggest
upsets
in

history
,
and
the
term
Maracanazo
(
,
pronounced
,
roughly
translated
as
``
The
Agony
of
Maracanã
''
,
after
the
name
of
the
stadium
)
became
synonymous
with
the
match
.


It
was
the
second
(
and
to
date
,
the
last
)
final
match
featuring
two
South
American
teams
(
the
first
being
the
1930
final
between
Uruguay
and
Argentina
,
which
was
also
won
by
Uruguay
)
.


Ghiggia
was
the
last

game
;
he
died
on

was
a
naval
operation
by
the
Pakistan
Navy
to
attack
the
Indian
coastal
town
of
Dwarka
on
7
September
1965
.


This
was
the
first
use

,
armies
and
air
forces
of
both
nations
were
involved
in
intense
fighting
in
the
Punjab
region
and
in
Kashmir
.


To
relieve
pressure
on
the
southern
front
,
Pakistan
decided
to
use
its
navy
in
the
war
by
launching
a
quick
strike
on
Indian
coast
.


The
primary
objective
of
the
attack
ostensibly
was
to
destroy
the
radar
station
at
Dwarka
which
Pakistani
Naval
intelligence
believed
had
a
Huff-Duff
beacon
to
guide
Indian
bombers

between
the
British
Royal
Naval
frigate
and
the
Spanish

under
Commodore
George
Johnstone
,
was

when
he

the
Spanish
38-gun
frigate
``
Santa
Margarita
''
.


``
Tartar
''
,
with
the
wind
behind
her
,
caught
up
and
engaged
the
Spanish
vessel
.


After
around
two
hours
of
fighting
``
Santa
Marguerita
''
was
almost
dismasted
when
her
captain
decided
to
strike
her
colours
.


``
Santa
Margarita
''
was
added
to
the
Royal
Navy
under
her
existing
name

a
12-pounder
36-gun
frigate
.


She
had
a

The
2010
AFL
Grand
Final
was
a
series
of
two
Australian
rules
football
matches
between
the
Collingwood
Football
Club
and
the
St
Kilda
Football
Club
.


Together
they
are
considered
the
114th
annual
grand
final
of
the
Australian
Football
League
(
formerly
the
Victorian
Football
League
)
,
and
were
staged
to
determine
the
premiers
for
the
2010
AFL
season
.


The
premiership
is
usually
decided
by
a
single
match
;
however
,
as
the
first
grand
final
ended
in
a
draw
,
a
grand
final
replay
was
played
the
following
week
and
was
won
by
Collingwood
.


Both
grand
finals
were
held
at
the
Melbourne
Cricket
Ground
in
Melbourne
.


The
first
was
held
on
25
September
2010
.


The
game
was
attended
by
100,016
spectators
,
the
highest
crowd
for
a
VFL/AFL
game
since
the
1986
VFL
Grand
Final
.


The
match
ended
in
a
draw
,
with
both
teams
scoring
68
points
.


This
was
the
third
draw
in
a
VFL/AFL
grand
final
,
the
previous
two
occurring
in
1948
and
1977
.


The
premiership
was
decided
by
a
full
replay
on
2
October
2010
.


It
was
attended
by
93,853
people
.


Collingwood
defeated
St
Kilda
by
56
points
,
marking
Collingwood
's
fifteenth
VFL/AFL
premiership
victory
and
their
first
since
1990
.


It
was
the
last
grand
final
to
be
replayed
prior
to
the
introduction
of
extra
time
.


The
1968
VFL
Grand
Final
was
an
Australian
rules
football
game
contested
between
the
Carlton
Football
Club
and
Essendon
Football
Club
,
held
at
the
Melbourne
Cricket
Ground
on
Saturday
,
28
September
1968
.


It
was
the
72nd
annual
Grand
Final
of
the
Victorian
Football
League
,
staged
to
determine
the
premiers
for
the
1968
VFL
season
.


The
match
,
attended
by
a
record
crowd
of
116,828
spectators
,
was
won
by
Carlton
(
``
The
Blues
''
)
by
a
margin
of
3
points
,
making
it
that
club
's
tenth
premiership
victory
,
but
its
first
since
winning
the
1947
VFL
Grand
Final
.


The
Blues
emerged
victorious
despite
Essendon
kicking
more
goals
,
the
only
time
that
happened
in
a
VFL
Grand
Final
.


There
was
a
strong
wind
blowing
during
the
whole
game
,
which
did
not
help
it
as
a
spectacle
and
possibly
contributed
to
Carlton
's
inaccuracy
.


Garry
Crane
starred
on
the
wing
for
the
Blues
with
30
possessions
.


Essendon
came
within
a
point
of
Carlton
at
the
20
minute
mark
of
the
final
term
after
a
goal
to
Geoff
Blethyn
.


Despite
being
goal-less
in
the
final
quarter
,
Carlton
managed
to
keep
their
lead
,
thanks
largely
to
20th
man
Neil
Chandler
,
who
took
some
crucial
marks
in
the
dying
stages
.


Aided
by
the
opening
during
the
year
of
the
ground
's
new
Western
Stand
,
the
attendance
of
116,828
was
the
highest
at
a
VFL
premiership
decider
up
to
that
time
,
breaking
the
record
of
115,902
spectators
who
witnessed
the
1956
VFL
Grand
Final
.


The
new
record
was
broken
at
the
1969
VFL
Grand
Final
,
and
that
record
was
broken
in
turn
at
the
1970
VFL
Grand
Final
.

However
with

playing
in
an

1999
,
at

Memphis
Pyramid
in

,
Tennessee
.


The

,
Paul

.


Eight
professional
wrestling
matches
were
scheduled
on
the
event
's
card
.


The
first
main
event
was
that
of
the
WWF
Championship
.


As
The
Rock
and
Mankind
had
fought
many
times
previously
with
ambiguous
match
endings
,
it
was
decided
the
match
would
be
a
Last
Man
Standing
match
,
a
match
where
a
wrestler
loses
if
they
can
not
stand
up
before
the
referee
counts
to
ten
.


The
second
main
event
was
a
steel
cage
match
between
Stone
Cold
Steve
Austin
and
the
owner
of
the
company
,
Vince
McMahon
,
to
decide
whether

the
following
month
.


The
Nine
Years
'
War
,
sometimes
called
Tyrone
's
Rebellion
,
took
place
in
Ireland
from
1593
to
1603
.


It
was
fought
between
an
Irish
alliance—led
mainly
by
Hugh
O'Neill
of
Tír
Eoghain
and
Hugh
Roe
O'Donnell
of
Tyrconnell—against
English
rule
in
Ireland
,
and
was
a
response
to
the
then-ongoing
Tudor
conquest
of
Ireland
.


The
war
was
fought
in
all
parts
of
the
country
,
but
mainly
in
the
northern
province
of
Ulster
.


The
Irish
alliance
won
some
important
early
victories
,
such
as
the
Battle
of
Clontibret
(
1595
)
and
the
Battle
of
the
Yellow
Ford
(
1598
)
,
but
the
English
won
a
decisive
victory
against
the
alliance
and
their
Spanish
allies
in
the
Siege
of
Kinsale
(
1601-2
)
.


the
war
ended
with
the
treaty
of
mellifont
(
1603
)
.


Many
of
the
defeated
northern
lords
left
Ireland
to
seek
support
for
a
new
uprising
in
the
Flight
of
the
Earls
(
1607
)
,
never
to
return
.


This
marked
the
end
of
Gaelic
Ireland
and
led
to
the
Plantation
of
Ulster
.


The
war
against
O'Neill
and
his
allies
was
the
largest
conflict
fought
by
England
in
the
Elizabethan
era
.


At
the
height
of
the
conflict
(
1600–1601
)
more
than
18,000
soldiers
were
fighting
in
the
English
army
in
Ireland
.


By
contrast
,
the
English
army
assisting
the
Dutch
during
the
Eighty
Years
'
War
was
never
more
than
12,000
strong
at
any
one
time
.


The
1975
World
Ice
Hockey
Championships
were
the
42nd
Ice
Hockey
World
Championships
and
the
53rd
European
Championships
of
ice
hockey
.


The
tournament
took
place
in
West
Germany
from
3
April
to
19
April
and
the
games
were
played
in
Munich
and
Düsseldorf
.


Six
teams
took
part
in
the
main
tournament
,
each
playing
each
other
twice
.


The
Soviet
Union
won
all
of
their
games
,
and
became
World
Champions
for
the
fourteenth
time
,
and
won
their
17th
European
title
.


This
year
did
not
offer
much
in
the
way
of
drama
,
with
the
expected
order
of
finish
happening
again
,
and
the
host
not
even
playing
in
the
top
level
tournament
.


This
helped
to
change
the
player
eligibility
rules
and
change
the
format
.


Finland
narrowly
missed
a
medal
again
,
finishing
fourth
for
the
sixth

during
the
annual
Sturgis
Motorcycle
Rally
.


After
the
first

,
WCW

.


in

,
it

WrestleCrap
writer
Art

''
and
said
that
WCW
held
``
a

pay-per-view
at
a

rally
with

because

During
the
1925–26
Victorian
bushfire
season
a
series
of
major
bushfires
occurred
between
26
January
and
10
March
1926
in
the
state
of
Victoria
in
Australia
.


A
total
of
60
people
were
killed
,
700
injured
,
and
1000
buildings
were
destroyed
across
the
south-east
of
the
state
.


On

Black
Sunday
,
bushfires
swept
across
Gippsland
,
the
Yarra
Valley
,
the
Dandenong
Ranges
and
the
Kinglake
area
.


The
fires
had
originated
in
forest
areas
on
26
January
,
but
wind
gusts
of
up
to
97
km
per
hour
led
to
the
joining
of
the
fire
fronts
on
14
February
.


In
the
Warburton
area
alone
,
31
deaths
were

The
Vilna
offensive
was
a
campaign
of
the
Polish–Soviet
War
of
1919–1921
.


The
Polish
army
launched
an
offensive
on
April
16
,
1919
,
to
take
Vilnius
(
)
from
the
Red
Army
.


After
three
days
of
street
fighting
from
April
19–21
,
the
city
was
captured
by
Polish
forces
,
causing
the
Red
Army
to
retreat
.


During
the
offensive
,
the
Poles
also
succeeded
in
securing
the
nearby
cities
of
Lida
,
Pinsk
,
Navahrudak
,
and
Baranovichi
.


The
Red
Army
launched
a
series
of
counterattacks
in
late
April
,
all
of
which
ended
in
failure
.


The
Soviets
briefly
recaptured
the
city
a
year
later
,
in
spring
1920
,
when
the
Polish
army
was
retreating
along
the
entire
front
.


In
the
aftermath
,
the
Vilna
offensive
would
cause
much
turmoil
on
the
political
scene
in
Poland
and
abroad
.


The
Battle
of
Bitlis
refers
to
a
series
of
engagements
in
the
summer
of
1916
for
the
town
of
Bitlis
and
to
a
lesser
extent
nearby
Moush
,
between
Russian
Imperial
forces
and
their
Ottoman
counterparts
.


The
first
military
confrontation
at
Bitlis
occurred
in
July
1915
,
when
Russian
troops
launched
an
unsuccessful
assault
on
the
town
's
fortifications
.


The
second
confrontation
began
in
February
1916
and
ended
with
the
capture
of
Bitlis
by
new
Russian
corps
,
which
largely
consisted
of
the
1st
Battalion
of
the
Armenian
volunteer
units
under
the
command
of
Andranik
Ozanian
.


The
town
was
the
last
stronghold
of
the
Ottoman
Empire
to
prevent
the
Russians
from
entering
in
Anatolia
and
Mesopotamia
.


After
their
defeat
,
the
Ottoman
Army
gave
Mustafa
Kemal
the
organization
of
the
defense
of
the
region
.


The
Ottomans
,
however
,
were
quickly
overwhelmed
,
and
after
resistance
from
1–9
August
1916
,
the
entire
region
fell
to
the
Russian
Empire
and
Armenian
volunteers
.


On
7
August
,
Mustafa
Kemal
rallied
his
troops
and
mounted
a
counteroffensive
.


He
had
so
strengthened
the
morale
of
his
force
,
following
its
defeat
,
that
within
five
days
,
two
of
his
divisions
captured
not
only
Bitlis
but
the
equally
important
town
of
Muş
,
greatly
disturbing
the
calculations
of
the
Russian
Command
.

WCW
Uncensored
was
an
annual
professional
wrestling
pay-per-view
(
PPV
)
event
from
World
Championship
Wrestling
(
WCW
)
held
in
the
month
of
March
from
1995
through
2000
.


It
was
replaced
by
Greed
in
2001
.


The
recurring
concept
of
``
Uncensored
''
was
that
it
was
an
event
that
,
in
storylines
,
the
(
fictional
)
WCW
Board
of
Directors
had
washed
their
hands
of
.


Thus
,
each
match
on
the
card
was
ostensibly
unsanctioned
,
meaning
they
were
not
subject
to
the
normal
rules
of
WCW-sanctioned
wrestling
matches
.


In
reality
,
it
was
a
normally-booked
WCW
show
,
albeit
one
with
a
tendency
to
feature
more
gimmick
matches
than
usual
.


This
notion
,
however
,
was
downplayed
during
the
last
few
years
that
it
was
part
of
the
WCW
PPV
schedule
.


Hulk
Hogan
was
featured
in
the
main
event
of
all
six
versions
of
the
event
.


In
2014
,
All
WCW
pay-per-views
were
made
available
on
the
WWE
Network
.


Invasion
(
also
typeset
as
InVasion
)
was
a
professional
wrestling
pay-per-view
(
PPV
)
event
produced
by
the
then
World
Wrestling
Federation
(
WWF
)
.


It
took
place
on
July
22
,
2001
at
the
Gund
Arena
in
Cleveland
,
Ohio
.


This
event
was
initially
planned
to
be
called
Fully
Loaded
,
as
it
was
advertised
at
the
King
of
the
Ring
event
,
which
immediately
preceded
Invasion
.


Invasion
was
the
first
pay-per-view
to
feature
the
ongoing
Invasion
storyline
,
which
featured
wrestlers
from
the
WWF
taking
on
The
Coalition
,
a
combined
force
of
wrestlers
from
World
Championship
Wrestling
(
WCW
)
and
Extreme
Championship
Wrestling
(
ECW
)
,
later
known
as
The
Alliance
.


The
event
featured
WWF
wrestlers
facing
WCW
and
ECW
wrestlers
.


The
main
event
,
dubbed
the
``
Inaugural
Brawl
,
''
was
a
five-on-five
tag
team
match
between
Team
WWF
and
Team
WCW/ECW
.


the
other
main
match
was
a
singles
match
for
the
wwf
hardcore
championship
between
rob
van
dam
and
jeff
hardy
.


With
a
buyrate
of
770,000
,
the
event
is
the
highest
grossing
non-WrestleMania
pay-per-view
in
WWE
history
.


Operation
Mars
,
also
known
as
the
Second
Rzhev-Sychevka
Offensive
Operation
(
Russian
:
Вторая
Ржевско-Сычёвская
наступательная
операция
)
,
was
the
codename
for
an
offensive
launched
by
Soviet
forces
against
German
forces
during
World
War
II
.


It
took
place
between
25
November
and
20
December
1942
around
the
Rzhev
salient
in
the
vicinity
of
Moscow
.


The
offensive
was
a
joint
operation
of
the
Soviet
Western
Front
and
Kalinin
Front
coordinated
by
Georgy
Zhukov
.


The
offensive
was
one
in
a
series
of
particularly
bloody
engagements
collectively
known
in
Soviet
and
Russian
histories
as
the
Battles
of
Rzhev
,
which
occurred
near
Rzhev
,
Sychevka
and
Vyazma
between
January
1942
and
March
1943
.


The
battles
became
known
as
the
``
Rzhev
meat
grinder
''
(
``
Ржевская
мясорубка
''
)
for
their
huge
losses
,
particularly
on
the
Soviet
side
.


For
many
years
they
were
relegated
to
a
footnote
in
Soviet
military
history
.


The
(
1180–1185
)
was
a
national
civil
war
between
the
Taira
and
Minamoto
clans
during
the
late-Heian
period
of
Japan
.


It
resulted
in
the
downfall
of
the
Taira
and
the
establishment
of
the
Kamakura
shogunate
under
Minamoto
no
Yoritomo
in
1192
.


The
name
``
Genpei
''
(
sometimes
romanized
as
``
Gempei
''
)
comes
from
alternate
readings
of
the
``
kanji
''
``
Minamoto
''
(
源
``
Gen
''
)
and
``
Taira
''
(
平
``
Hei
''
)
.


The
conflict
is
also
known
in
Japanese
as
the
,
after
the
two
Imperial
eras
between
which
it
took
place
.


It
followed
a
coup
d'état
by
the
Taira
in
1179
with
the
removal
of
rivals
from
all
government
posts
,
and
subsequently
banishing
them
,
and
a
call
to
arms
against
them
,
led
by
the
Minamoto
in
1180
.


The
ensuing
battle
of
Uji
took
place
just
outside
Kyoto
,
starting
a
five-year-long
war
,
concluding
with
a
decisive
Minamoto
victory
in
the
naval
battle
of
Dan-no-ura
.


The
1971
Football
League
Cup
Final
took
place
in
February
1971
at
Wembley
Stadium
.


It
was
the
eleventh
Football
League
Cup
final
and
the
fifth
to
be
played
at
Wembley
.


It
was
contested
between
Tottenham
Hotspur
and
Aston
Villa
.


Tottenham
Hotspur
were
riding
high
in
the
First
Division
(
as
the
top
level
of
league
football
in
England
was
then
known
)
and
Aston
Villa
,
the
most
successful
club
of
the
late
Victorian
and
Edwardian
eras
and
a
traditional
heavyweight
,
were
in
the
Third
Division
(
then
the
third
tier
of
English
football
)
,
a
level
to
which
it
had
never
previously
sunk
.


This
match
signalled
the
reversal
of
a
long
period
of
decline
for
Villa
.


Ten
years
later
they
were
champions
of
England
and
the
following
year
they
had
become
the
champions
of
Europe
.


The
1999
IBAF
Intercontinental
Cup
was
held
in
Australia
from
3
November
to
14
November
1999
.


Eight
countries
contested
the
tournament
,
and
has
been
the
only
Intercontinental
Cup
hosted
in
the
Southern
Hemisphere
.


The
eight
participating
countries
were
Cuba
,
Australia
,
Italy
,
the
Netherlands
,
Japan
,
South
Korea
,
United
States
and
Chinese
Taipei
.


The
tournament
was
sanctioned
by
the
International
Baseball
Federation
.


The
Cup
was
perhaps
the
brightest
moment
in
the
history
of
the
Australia
national
baseball
team
,
as
they
stunned
the
Cuba
national
baseball
team
in
the
finals
,
winning
the
game
4-3
.


The
MVP
of
the
tournament
was
also
Australian
MLB
player
and
former
All-Star
,
Dave
Nilsson
.


On
10
December
1983
a
bomb
exploded
at
the
Royal
Artillery
Barracks
in
Woolwich
,
South
East
London
.


The
explosion
injured
five
people
and
caused
minor
damage
to
the
building
.


The
bomb
exploded
in
a
guard
room
,
leaving
a
crater
deep
.


A
Christmas
party
was
underway
in
the
Sergeants
'
Mess
,
around
away
,
when
the
bomb
exploded
.


The
Scottish
National
Liberation
Army
claimed
responsibility
for
the
bombing
,
stating
that
``
more
will
follow
''
,
although
Scotland
Yard
believed
that
the
IRA
were
behind
the
attack
.


The
IRA
later
admitted
responsibility
for
the
attack
.


In
November
1974
a
pub
close
to
the
barracks
which
was
popular
with
local
soldiers
was
bombed
by
the
IRA
in
which
a
soldier
and
a
barman
were
killed
and
over
30
people
were
injured
.


In
May
2013
a
soldier
from
the
barracks
was
murdered
just
outside
the
base
.


The
Seven
Days
Battles
were
a
series
of
seven
battles
over
seven
days
from
June
25
to
July
1
,
1862
,
near
Richmond
,
Virginia
,
during
the
American
Civil
War
.


Confederate
General
Robert
E.
Lee
drove
the
invading
Union
Army
of
the
Potomac
,
commanded
by
Maj.
Gen.
George
B.
McClellan
,
away
from
Richmond
and
into
a
retreat
down
the
Virginia
Peninsula
.


The
series
of
battles
is
sometimes
known
erroneously
as
the
Seven
Days
Campaign
,
but
it
was
actually
the
culmination
of
the
Peninsula
Campaign
,
not
a
separate
campaign
in
its
own
right
.


The
Seven
Days
began
on
Wednesday
,
June
25
,
1862
,
with
a
Union
attack
in
the
minor
Battle
of
Oak
Grove
,
but
McClellan
quickly
lost
the
initiative
as
Lee
began
a
series
of
attacks
at
Beaver
Dam
Creek
(
Mechanicsville
)
on
June
26
,
Gaines
's
Mill
on
June
27
,
the
minor
actions
at
Garnett
's
and
Golding
's
Farm
on
June
27
and
28
,
and
the
attack
on
the
Union
rear
guard
at
Savage
's
Station
on
June
29
.


McClellan
's
Army
of
the
Potomac
continued
its
retreat
toward
the
safety
of
Harrison
's
Landing
on
the
James
River
.


Lee
's
final
opportunity
to
intercept
the
Union
Army
was
at
the
Battle
of
Glendale
on
June
30
,
but
poorly
executed
orders
and
the
delay
of
Stonewall
Jackson
's
troops
allowed
his
enemy
to
escape
to
a
strong
defensive
position
on
Malvern
Hill
.


at
the
battle
of
malvern
hill
on
july
1
,
lee
launched
futile
frontal
assaults
and
suffered
heavy
casualties
in
the
face
of
strong
infantry
and
artillery
defenses
.


The
Seven
Days
ended
with
McClellan
's
army
in
relative
safety
next
to
the
James
River
,
having
suffered
almost
16,000
casualties
during
the
retreat
.


Lee
's
army
,
which
had
been
on
the
offensive
during
the
Seven
Days
,
lost
over
20,000
.


As
Lee
became
convinced
that
McClellan
would
not
resume
his
threat
against
Richmond
,
he
moved
north
for
the
northern
Virginia
campaign
and
the
Maryland
campaign
.


Battle
of
Ceber
took
place
overnight
of
August
4
and
August
5
,
1944
in
the
village
of
Ceber
in
the
Holy
Cross
Mountains
(
Świętokrzyskie
)
.


A
battalion
of
Polish
partisans
of
the
Home
Army
's
2nd
Legions
'
Infantry
Regiment
led
by
Capt
.


Michał
Mandziara
(
nom
de
guerre
Siwy
)
assaulted
a
German
garrison
of
the
village
,
took
it
by
surprise
and
annihilated
it
after
a
brief
encounter
.


The
battle
was
part
of
a
larger
Operation
Tempest
.


The
Polish
unit
numbered
84
men
(
entire
3rd
battalion
of
the
2nd
Legions
'
Infantry
Regiment
)
and
was
organised
into
two
platoons
led
by
second
lieutenant
Dionizy
Mędrzycki
(
nom
de
guerre
Reder
)
and
second
lieutenant
Witold
Józefowski
(
nom
de
guerre
Miś
)
.


The
Poles
assaulted
the
German
garrison
overnight
and
from
numerous
directions
.


After
a
brief
fight
the
enemy
force
was
destroyed
.


The
Poles
acquired
plenty
of
war
materiel
,
including
22
machine
guns
,
a
gun
repair
shop
,
an
infantry
mortar
with
ammunition
,
an
ambulance
and
plenty
of
supplies
.


Polish
losses
were
relatively
small
:
only
one
soldier
and
one
officer
were
wounded
in
action
and
died
the
following
day
.


German
losses
were
approximately
40
killed
and
39
taken
prisoner
of
war
.

The
Tamworth
Country
Music
Festival
is
an
annual
music
festival
in
January
held
in
Tamworth
,
New
South
Wales
,
Australia
and
is
a
celebration
of
country
music
culture
and
heritage
in
particular
the
national
Australian
country
music
scene
,
with
numerous
concerts
and
live
performances
at
various
venues
.


The
festival
lasts
for
two
weeks
over
Australia
Day
and
during
this
period
the
city
of
Tamworth
comes
alive
,
with
visitors
from
all
across
the
country
and
worldwide
who
come
to
join
in
the
festivities
.


The
festival
has
many
times
been
counted
among
the
world
's
top
ten
music
festivals
.


In
2007
``
Forbes
''
rated
it
as
number
8
of
the
World
's
Coolest
Music
Festivals
.


The
enormous
number
of
visitors
during
the
bash
doubles
the
city
's
population
and
brings
significant
tourism
and
economic
benefits
to
the
region
.


Visitor
numbers
for
the
2012
festival
were
estimated
at
50,000
.


The
mass
number
of
visitors
means
that
accommodation
throughout
the
area
is
consistently
booked
out
for
this
period
up
to
12
months
in
advance
,
with
many
visitors
camping
in
caravans
,
camper
vans
and
tents
by
the
city
's
riverside
and
numerous
other
temporary
camping

The
Saintonge
War
was
a
feudal
dynastic
encounter
that
occurred
in
1242
and
1243
between
forces
of
Alphonse
,
Count
of
Poitiers
,
supported
by
Louis
IX
of
France
,
and
those
of
Hugh
X
of
Lusignan
and
Raymond
VII
of
Toulouse
,
backed
by
Henry
III
of
England
.


Saintonge
is
the
region
around
Saintes
in
the
centre-west
of
France
in
which
most
of
the
war
occurred
.


The
conflict
arose
because
vassals
of
Louis
in
Poitou
were
displeased
with
the
accession
of
his
brother
,
Alphonse
,
as
Count
of
Poitou
.


The
French
decisively
defeated
the
English
and
rebel
forces
at
the
Battle
of
Taillebourg
and
concluded
the
struggle
at
the
Siege
of
Saintes
.


Louis
further
repressed
the
Toulousians
into
surrendering
.


Because
of
dynastic
sensibilities
and
the
desire
to
go
on
a
crusade
,
Louis
did
not
annex
Guyenne
,
and
the
result
was
relatively
status
quo
.


The
battle
was
the
last
major
conflict
between
the
English
and
French
until
the
Anglo-French
war
of
1294-1303
.


The
war
further
planted
the
seeds
for
the
Second
Barons
'
war
in
England
,
due
to
the
waste
of
funds
and
to
the
growing
resentment
among
the
barons
towards
the
king
,
for
his
tyrannical
ways
(
by
ignoring
the
Magna
Carta
)
and
for
his
incompetence
in
war
.

in
``
[

]
armed
formations
.
''


The
operation
involved
the
use
of
ground
troops
who
accompanied
a
complement
of
military
vehicles
,
artillery
and
helicopter
gunships
to
be
used
to
root
out
the
self-described
Armenian
``
fedayeen
''
.


However
,
contrary
to
their
stated
objectives
,
Soviet
troops
and
the
predominantly
Azerbaijani
soldiers
in
the
AzSSR
OMON
and
army
forcibly
uprooted
Armenians
living
in
the
24
villages
strewn
across
Shahumyan
to
leave
their
homes
and
settle
elsewhere
in
Nagorno-Karabakh
or
in
the
neighboring
Armenian
SSR
.


Following
this
,
the
Armenian
inhabitants
of
17
villages
across
the
Shushi
and
Hadrut
regions
were
forcibly
removed
.


British
journalist
Thomas
de
Waal
has
described
``
Ring
''
as
the
Soviet
Union
's
first
and
only
civil
war
.


Some
authors
have
also
described
the
actions
of
the
joint
Soviet
and
Azerbaijani
force
as
ethnic
cleansing
.


The
military
operation
was
accompanied
by
systematic
and
gross
human
rights
abuses
.


The
Second
Carlist
War
,
or
the
War
of
the
Matiners
(
Catalan
for
``
early-risers
,
''
so-called
from
the
harassing
action
that
took
place
at
the
earliest
hours
of
the
morning
)
,
was
a
civil
war
occurred
in
Spain
,
to
some
historians
considered
a
direct
catalan
revolt
against
Madrid
,
fought
primarily
in
Catalonia
by
the
Carlists
under
General
Ramón
Cabrera
against
the
forces
of
the
government
of
Isabella
II
.


The
uprising
began
in
September
1846
and
continued
until
May
1849
,
spreading
to
Galicia
.


Theoretically
,
the
war
was
fought
to
facilitate
the
marriage
of
Isabella
II
with
the
Carlist
pretender
,
Carlos
de
Borbón
(
or
``
Carlos
VI
''
)
,
which
was
supported
by
the
moderate
party
and
by
the
Carlists
.


The
marriage
never
took
place
,
as
Isabella
II
was
wed
to
Francisco
de
Borbón
.


The
main
reasons
of
the
uprising
were
the
liberal
centrist
policies
of
queen
Isabella
II
,
and
the
promise
of
the
carlist
pretender
of
restoring
the
catalan
constitutions
or
``
furs
''
abolished
a
century
ago
by
the
Nueva
Planta
decrees
.


The
conflict
was
rather
minor
in
the
Basque
Country
in
the
Basque
context
,
a
central
focus
of
Carlist
uprisings
,
it
was
non-existent
,
so
``
Second
Carlist
War
''
invariably
refers
to
the
Third
Carlist
War
.


It
coincided
with
the
democratic
Revolutions
of
1848
,
when
Maria
Christina
revoked
the
constitution
of
Ramón
de
Narváez
.


Narváez
himself
led
the
counterattack
against
the
revolt
in
Galicia
while
Fernando
de
Córdova
,
captain-general
of
Catalonia
,
put
down
the
isolated
rebel
cells
in
that
region
by
early
1849
.


In
June
of
that
year
,
amnesty
was
granted
to
the
Carlists
and
those
who
had
fled
returned
.


The
war
caused
between
30,000
and
100,000
casualties
.


The
2004
Australian
embassy
bombing
took
place
on
9
September
2004
in
Jakarta
,
Indonesia
.


A
one-tonne
car
bomb
,
which
was
packed
into
a
small
Daihatsu
delivery
van
,
exploded
outside
the
Australian
embassy
at
Kuningan
District
,
South
Jakarta
,
at
about
10:30
local
time
(
03:30
UTC
)
,
killing
9
people
including
the
suicide
bomber
,
and
wounding
over
150
others
.


The
explosion
gutted
the
Greek
embassy
on
the
12th
floor
of
an
adjacent
building
,
where
three
diplomats
were
slightly
wounded
.


Damage
to
the
nearby
Chinese
embassy
was
also
reported
.


Numerous
office
buildings
surrounding
the
embassy
were
also
damaged
by
the
blast
,
which
shattered
windows
in
buildings
away
,
injuring
many
workers
inside
,
mostly
by
broken
glass
.


A
dispute
ensued
as
to
how
many
civilians
died
after
the
explosion
:
local
health
authorities
in
Jakarta
reported
9
deaths
,
compared
to
11
deaths
reported
by
Australian
officials
.


Nonetheless
,
all
Australians
working
at
the
embassy
were
reported
alive
.


Among
the
victims
killed
were
embassy
security
guard
Anton
Sujarwo
,
23
,
and
four
Indonesian
policemen
on
duty
at
the
embassy
.


The
rest
were
civilians
,
including
the
embassy
gardener
,
Suryadi
,
34
,
two
embassy
workers
,
a
visa
applicant
,
and
a
pedestrian
.

as
a
non-frontal
low
,
it
moved
rapidly
throughout
its
duration
and
struck
southwestern
Florida
early
the
next
day
as
a
gale-force
storm
.


In
the
state
,
the
winds
damaged
some
crops
and
power
lines
,
but
no
serious
damage
was
reported
.


The
system
became
a
tropical
storm
after
emerging
over
the
Atlantic
Ocean
before
quickly
transitioning
into
an
extratropical
cyclone
on
February
4
.


Strong
winds
and
waves
washed
a
freighter
ashore
,
but
no
injuries
were
related
to
the
event
.


Subsequently
,
the
storm
brushed
eastern
New
England
,
causing

outages
,
before

moved
inland
near
Maine
.


There

Atlantic
hurricane
season
.

seventh
tropical
cyclone
,
third
hurricane
,
and
second
major
hurricane
of
the
season
,
Gustav
caused
serious
damage
and
casualties
in
Haiti
,
the
Dominican
Republic
,
Jamaica
,
the
Cayman
Islands
,
Cuba
and
the
United
States
.


Gustav
caused
at
least
$
8.31
billion
(
2008
USD
)
in
damages
.


It
formed
on
the
morning
of
August
25
,
2008
,
about
southeast
of
Port-au-Prince
,
Haiti
,
and
rapidly
strengthened
into
a
tropical
storm
that
afternoon
and
into
a
hurricane
early
on
August
26
.


Later
that
day
it
made
landfall
near
the
Haitian
town
of
Jacmel
.


It
inundated
Jamaica
and
ravaged
Western
Cuba
and
then
steadily
moved
across
the
Gulf
of
Mexico
.


Once
into
the
Gulf
,
Gustav
gradually
weakened
because
of
increased
wind
shear
and
dry
air
.


It
weakened
to
a
Category
2
hurricane
late
on
August
31
,
and
remained
at
that
intensity
until
landfall
on
the
morning
of
September
1
near
Cocodrie
,
Louisiana
.


Weakening
continued
,
and
Gustav
weakened
to
a
tropical
storm
that
evening
and
to
a
tropical
depression
the
next
day
as
it
meandered
around
the
south-central
US
.


The
weak
system
became
extratropical
on
September
4
and
was
absorbed
by
another
low
on
September
5
.


In
total
,
an
estimated
153
deaths
had
been
attributed
to
Gustav
in
the
U.S.
and
Caribbean
.


Damage
in
the
U.S.
totaled
to
$
6
billion
(
2008
USD
)
with
additional
damage
of
$
2.1
billion
in
Cuba
and
$
210
million
in
damage
in

The
Ukrainian
War
of
Independence
,
a
period
of
sustained
warlike
conflict
,
lasted
from
1917
to
1921
and
resulted
in
the
establishment
and
development
of
a
Ukrainian
republic
–
later
a
part
of
the
Soviet
Union
as
the
Ukrainian
Soviet
Socialist
Republic
of
1922–1991
.


The
war
consisted
of
a
series
of
military
conflicts
between
different
governmental
,
political
and
military
forces
.


Belligerents
included
Ukrainian
nationalists
,
anarchists
,
Bolsheviks
,
the
forces
of

and
resulted
in
the
division
of
Ukraine
between
the
Bolshevik
Ukrainian
SSR
,
Poland
,
Romania
,
and
Czechoslovakia
.


The
conflict
is
frequently
viewed
within
the
framework
of
the
Russian
Civil
War
of
1917–1922
,
as
well
as
the
closing
stage
of
the
Eastern
Front
of
the
First
World
War
of
1914–1918
.

estimated
no
more
than
800,000

with
the

putting
the
figure
between

,
comparable
to
the

national
park
service
no
longer
makes
official
estimates
of

referring
to
it
as

aggressive
and
even
occasionally

almost
delightfully

Hurricane
Claudette
was
the
third
tropical
storm
and
first
hurricane
of
the
2003
Atlantic
hurricane
season
.


A
fairly
long-lived
July
Atlantic
hurricane
,
Claudette
began
as
a
tropical
wave
in
the
eastern
Caribbean
.


It
moved
quickly
westward
,
brushing
past
the
Yucatán
Peninsula
before
moving
northwestward
through
the
Gulf
of
Mexico
.


Claudette
remained
a
tropical
storm
until
just
before
making
landfall
in
Port
O'Connor
,
Texas
,
when
it
quickly
strengthened
to
a
strong
Category
1
hurricane
on
the
Saffir-Simpson
Hurricane
Scale
.


Forecasting
of
its
path
and
intensity
was
uncertain
throughout
its
lifetime
,
resulting
in
widespread
and
often
unnecessary
preparations
along
its
path
.


Claudette
was
the
first
hurricane
to
make
landfall
in
July
in
the
United
States
since
Hurricane
Danny
in
the
1997
season
.


The
hurricane
caused
two
deaths
and
moderate
damage
in
Texas
,
mostly
from
strong
winds
,
as
well
as
extensive
beach
erosion
.


Because
of
the
damage
,
President
George
W.
Bush
declared
portions
of
South
Texas
a
Federal
Disaster
Area
,
allowing
the
affected
citizens
to
apply
for
aid
.


Claudette
also
caused
significant
rainfall
and
minor
damage
in
the
Mexican
state
of
Quintana
Roo
as
a
tropical
storm
,
as
well
as
minor
damage
on
Saint
Lucia
before
developing
into
a
tropical
cyclone
.
