in O

, O
was O
preparing B-getready
to O
launch B-process_start
the O
military O
rebellion O
in O
the O
city O
. O

However O
, O
when O
he O
tried O
to O
march B-motion_directional
out O
of O
the O
barracks O
, O
his O
2,500 O
troops O
were O
forced B-motion
back O
inside O
the O
compound B-cause_to_amalgamate
by O
hostile O
crowds O
and O
armed O
trade O
unionists O
. O

On O
the O
20th O
, O
the O
barracks O
was O
stormed B-catastrophe
by O
a O
mixture O
of O
workers O
and O
`` O
Guardias O

'' O
( O

loyal O
to O

, O
as O

as O
five O
battalions O
of O
the O
Communist-led O
Antifascist O
Worker O
and O
Peasant O
Militias O
( O
MAOC O
) O
—one O
of O
these O
battalions O
became B-becoming
the O
famous O
`` O
Fifth O
Regiment O
'' O
— O
totaling O
about O
10,000 O
fighters O
. O

The O
fighting B-hostile_encounter
was O
chaotic O
, O
and O
on O
several O
occasions O
some O
soldiers O
within O
the O
barracks O
indicated B-coming_to_believe
their O
willingness O
to O
surrender B-surrendering
, O
only O
for O
other O
troops O
to O
keep O
firing O
at O
the O
attackers B-attack
, O
killing B-killing
those O
who O
had O
broken B-destroying
cover O
to O
take O
them O
prisoner O
. O

Eventually O
the O
barracks O
fell B-conquering
when O
the O
`` O
Guardias O

'' O
brought B-bringing
up O
a O

and O
its O
gate O
was O
opened B-openness
by O
a O
sapper O
sergeant O
sympathetic O
to O
the O
Republican O
side O
. O

The O
sergeant O
was O
killed B-killing
by O
one O
of O
his O
officers O
, O
but O
his O
action O
allowed B-preventing_or_letting
the O
Republicans O
to O
breach B-damaging
the O
walls O
. O

A O
number O
of O
soldiers O
were O
massacred B-committing_crime
by O
the O
crowd O
, O
enraged B-change_sentiment
by O
the O
apparent O
false O
surrenders B-surrendering
, O
after O
the O
fall O
of O
the O
barracks O
. O

Thereafter O
and O
for O
the O
remainder O
of O
the O
war O
, O
Madrid O
was O
held B-hold
by O
the O
Republicans O
. O

However O
, O
its O
population O
contained B-containing
a O
significant O
number O
of O
right-wing O
sympathisers O
. O

The O
weeks O
that O
followed B-self_motion
the O
July O
uprising B-change_of_leadership
, O
saw B-self_motion
a O
number O
of O
so-called O
fascists O
or O
fascist O
sympathisers O
being O
killed B-killing
in O
Madrid O
by O
Republicans O
. O

For O

, O
on O
23 O
August O
70 O
prisoners O
from O
the O
`` O
Modelo O
'' O
Prison O
in O
the O
city O
were O
massacred B-committing_crime

for O
the O
Nationalist O
killing O
of O
over O
1,500 O
Republicans O
after O
the O
storming B-catastrophe
of O
Badajoz O
. O

However O
, O
the O
resistance O
to O
the O
coup O
by O
Republicans O
meant O
that O
instead O
of O
this O
, O
Franco O
and O
his O

would O
have O
to O
conquer B-conquering
the O
country O
by O
military O
force O
if O
they O
wanted O
to O
seize O
power O
. O

Franco O
himself O
had O
landed B-arriving
in O
Algeciras O
in O
southern O

with O

, O
raised B-creating

Together O
, O
they O
planned B-arranging

the O
Spanish O
capital O

, O

. O

Yague O
argued B-quarreling
for O
a O
rapid O
advance O
on O
Madrid O
, O
but O
Franco O
overruled B-destroying
him O
in O
favour O
of O
relieving B-cure
the O
Nationalist O

This O

by O
up O
to O
a O
month O
— O
giving O
the O

time O
to O

. O

Meanwhile O
, O
in O
the O
city O
, O
the O
Republican O
government O
had O
reformed B-reforming_a_system
under O
the O
leadership O
of O

. O

although O
the O
communists O
were O
a O
minority O
in O
the O
government O
, O
they O
gained B-getting
in O
influence O
through O
their O
access B-having_or_lacking_access
to O

from O
the O

General O

forces O
sent B-sending
from O
the O
USSR O
and O
General O
Dmitry O
Pavlov O
commanded B-control
their O
armoured O
forces O
. O

Most O
of O
the O
Republican O
defenders O
of O
Madrid O
( O
c.90 O
% O
) O
were O
militias O
, O
raised B-cause_change_of_position_on_a_scale
by O
left-wing O
political O
parties O
or O
trade O
unions O
, O
who O
elected B-choosing

. O

The O
Republican O
command B-control
had O
relatively O
little O
control B-control
over O
these O
units O
in O
the O
early O
phase O
of O
the O
Civil O
War O
. O

On O
the O
other O
side O
, O
both O
Nazi O
Germany O
and O
Fascist O
Italy O
supplied B-supply
Franco O
with O
air O
cover O
and O
armoured O
units O
for O
his O
assault O
on O
Madrid O
, O
while O
the O
Luftwaffe O
units O
in O
Spain O
, O
the O
Condor O
Legion O
, O
were O
commanded B-control
independently O
of O
Franco O
's O
officers O
. O

The O
Nationalists O
reached B-arriving
Madrid O
in O
early O
November O
1936 O
, O
approaching B-motion
it O
from O
the O
north O
along O
the O
Corunna O
Road O
and O
west O
Extremadura O
road O
. O

On O
29 O
October O
, O
a O
Republican O
counterattack O
by O
the O
5th O
( O
communist O
) O
regiment O
under O
Enrique O
Líster O
was O
beaten B-bodily_harm
off O
at O
Parla O
. O

On O
2 O
November O
, O
Brunete O
fell B-motion_directional
to O
the O
nationalists O
, O
leaving B-departing
their O
troops O
at O
the O
western O
suburb O
of O
Madrid O
. O

Mola O
famously O
remarked B-statement
to O
an O
English O
journalist O
that O
he O
would O
take O
Madrid O
with O
his O
four O
columns O
, O
of O
regular O
and O
Moroccan O
troops O
from O
southwest O
in O
Spain O
, O
outside O
the O
city O
and O
his O
`` O
Fifth O
column O
'' O
- O
composed O
of O
right O
wing O
sympathisers O
within O
it O
. O

The O
term O
`` O
fifth O
column O
'' O
became B-becoming
a O
synonym O
for O
spies O
or O
traitors O
on O
the O
Republican O
side O
and O
paranoia O
regarding O
them O
led O
to O
massacre O
of O
Nationalist O
prisoners O
in O
Madrid O
during O
the O
ensuing O
battle O
. O

The O
government O
including O
Caballero O
expected O
Madrid O
to O
fall B-motion_directional
and O
so O
made B-manufacturing
a O
pre-planned O
move B-motion
from O
Madrid O
on O
6 O
November O
to O
Valencia O
. O

General O
Miaja O
and O
the O
political O
leaders O
who O
remained B-presence
formed B-creating
the O
`` O
Junta O
de O

'' O
( O
Committee O
for O
the O
Defence O
of O
Madrid O
) O
to O
organise B-arranging
the O
republican O
defenders O
. O

However O
, O
the O
Nationalists O
' O
attempt O
to O
capture B-conquering
Madrid O
had O
some O
serious O
tactical O
drawbacks O
. O

For O
one O
thing O
, O
their O
troops O
were O
outnumbered B-expansion
over O
two O
to O
one O
by O
the O
defenders O
( O
although O
the O
Nationalists O
were O
far O
better O
trained B-education_teaching
and O
equipped B-supply
) O
. O

Another O
disadvantage O
was O
their O
inability O
to O
surround B-surrounding
Madrid O
and O
to O
cut B-removing
if O
off O
from O
outside O

The O
only O
surviving O
member O
of O

Nevill O

immediate O

was O
their O

Jeremy O
Bamber O
, O
then O
24 O
years O
old O
, O
who O
said B-telling

had O
been O
at O

few O
miles O
away O
when O
the O

took B-process_start

The O
police O
at O
first O
believed B-know
that O
Sheila O
, O
diagnosed O
with O
schizophrenia O
, O
had O
fired B-use_firearm
the O
shots O
then O
turned B-becoming
the O

on O

. O

But O
weeks O
after O
the O
murders B-killing
Jeremy O
Bamber O
's O
ex-girlfriend O
told B-telling
police O
that O
he O
had O
implicated B-collaboration
himself O
. O

The O
prosecution O
argued B-quarreling
that O
, O
motivated O
by O
a O
large O
inheritance O
, O
Bamber O
had O
shot B-use_firearm
the O
family O
with O
his O

then O
placed B-placing

to O
make B-causation
it I-causation
look O
like O
a O
murder–suicide O
. O

A O
silencer O
the O
prosecution O
said B-telling
was O
on O
the O
rifle O
would O
have O
made B-causation
it I-causation
too O
long O
, O
they O
argued B-quarreling
, O
for O
Sheila O

fingers O
to O
reach B-arriving
the O
trigger O
to O
shoot O
herself O
. O

Bamber O
was O
convicted B-legal_rulings
of O
five O
counts O
of O
murder O
in O
October O
1986 O
by O
a O
10–2 O
majority O
, O
sentenced B-legal_rulings
to O
a O
minimum O
of O
25 O
years O
, O
and O
informed B-telling
in O
1994 O
that O
he O
would O
never O
be O
released B-releasing
. O

Bamber O
protested O
his O
innocence O
throughout O
, O
although O
his O
extended B-change_event_time
family O
remained O
convinced O
of O
his O
guilt O
. O

between O
2004 O
and O
2012 O
, O
his O
lawyers O
submitted B-submitting_documents
several O
unsuccessful O
applications O
to O
the O
criminal O
cases O
review B-statement
commission O
. O

They O
argued B-quarreling
that O
the O
silencer O
might O
not O
have O
been O
used B-using
during O
the O
killings B-killing
, O
that O
the O
crime O
scene O
may O
have O
been O
damaged B-damaging
then O
reconstructed B-building
, O
that O

were O
taken B-creating
weeks O
after O
the O
murders O
, O
and O
that O
the O
time O
of O
Sheila O
's O
death O
had O
been O
miscalculated O
. O

A O
key O
issue O
was O
whether O
Bamber O
received B-receiving
a O
call O
from O
his O
father O
that O
night O
to O
say B-telling
Sheila O
had O
`` O
gone O
berserk O
'' O
with O
a O
gun O
. O

Bamber O
said B-communication
that O
he O
did O
, O
that O
he O
alerted B-warning
police O
, O
and O
that O
Sheila O
fired B-use_firearm
the O
final O
shot O
while O
he O
and O
the O
officers O
were O
standing B-placing
outside O
the O
house O
. O

It O
became B-becoming
a O
central O
plank O
of O
the O
prosecution O
's O
case O
that O
the O
father O
had O
made B-manufacturing
no O
such O
call O
, O
and O
that O
the O
only O
reason O
Bamber O
would O
have O
lied O
about O
it—indeed O
, O
the O
only O
way O
he O
could O
have O
known B-know
about O
the O
shootings O
when O
he O
alerted B-warning
the O
police—was O
that O
he O
was O
the O
killer O
himself O

The O

in O

during O

1967 O
Six-Day O
War—with O
some O
fighting O
in O
African O
Egypt O
and O
northern O
Israel O
. O

Egypt O
's O
initial O
war O
objective O
was O
to O
use B-using
its O
military O
to O
seize O
a O
foothold O
on O
the O
east O
bank O
of O
the O
Suez O

and O
use O
this O
to O
negotiate O
the O
return O
of O
the O
rest O
of O
Sinai O
. O

The O
war O
began B-process_start
when O
the O
Arab O
coalition O
launched O
a O
joint O
surprise O
attack O
on O
Israeli O
positions O
, O
on O
Yom O
Kippur O
, O
the O
holiest O
day O
in O
Judaism O
, O
which O
also O
occurred O
that O
year O
during O
the O
Muslim O
holy O
month O
of O
Ramadan O
. O

Egyptian O
and O
Syrian O
forces O
crossed B-motion_directional
ceasefire O
lines O
to O
enter O
the O
Sinai O
Peninsula O
and O
the O
Golan O
Heights O
, O
respectively O
. O

Both O
the O
United O
States O
and O
the O
Soviet O
Union O
initiated B-process_start
massive O
resupply O
efforts O
to O
their O
respective O
allies O
during O
the O
war O
, O
and O
this O
led B-causation
to I-causation
a O
near-confrontation O
between O
the O
two O
nuclear O
superpowers O
. O

The O
war O
began B-process_start
with O
a O
massive O
and O
successful O
Egyptian O
crossing O
of O
the O
Suez O
Canal O
. O

Egyptian O
forces O
crossed B-motion_directional
the O
cease-fire O
lines O
, O
then O
advanced B-cause_to_make_progress
virtually O
unopposed O
into O
the O
Sinai O
Peninsula O
. O

After O
three O
days O
, O
Israel O
had O
mobilized B-arranging
most O
of O
its O
forces O
and O
halted B-process_end
the O
Egyptian O
offensive O
, O
resulting O
in O
a O
military O
stalemate O
. O

The O
Syrians O
coordinated O
their O
attack O
on O
the O
Golan O
Heights O
to O
coincide O
with O
the O
Egyptian O
offensive O
and O
initially O
made B-getting
threatening O
gains O
into O
Israeli-held O
territory O
. O

Within O
three O
days O
, O
however O
, O
Israeli O
forces O
had O
pushed B-influence
the O
Syrians O
back O
to O
the O
pre-war O
ceasefire O
lines O
. O

the O
israel O
defense O
forces O
( O
idf O
) O
then O
launched B-process_start
a O
four-day O
counter-offensive O
deep O
into O
syria O
. O

Within O
a O
week O
, O
Israeli O
artillery O
began B-process_start
to O
shell O
the O
outskirts O
of O
Damascus O
, O
and O
Egyptian O
President O
Sadat O
began O
to O
worry O
about O
the O
integrity O
of O
his O
major O
ally O
. O

He O
believed B-know
that O
capturing O
two O
strategic O
passes O
located O
deeper O
in O
the O
Sinai O
would O
make O
his O
position O
stronger O
during O
post-war O
negotiations O
; O
he O
therefore O
ordered B-request
the O
Egyptians O
to O
go O
back O
on O
the O
offensive O
, O
but O
their O
attack O
was O
quickly O
repulsed B-defending
. O

The O
Israelis O
then O
counter-attacked B-attack
at O
the O
seam O
between O
the O
two O
Egyptian O
armies O
, O
crossed B-motion_directional
the O
Suez O
Canal O
into O
Egypt O
, O
and O
began B-process_start
slowly O
advancing O
southward O
and O
westward O
towards O
the O
city O
of O
Suez O
in O
over O
a O
week O
of O
heavy O
fighting O
that O
resulted O
in O
heavy O
casualties O
on O
both O
sides O
. O

By O
October O
24 O
, O
the O
Israelis O
had O
improved B-cause_to_make_progress
their O
positions O
considerably O
and O
completed B-process_end
their O
encirclement O
of O
Egypt O
's O
Third O
Army O
and O
the O
city O
of O
Suez O
. O

This O
development O
led B-causation
to I-causation
tensions O
between O
the O
United O
States O
and O
the O
Soviet O
Union O
, O
and O
a O
second O
ceasefire O
was O
imposed B-action
cooperatively O
on O
October O
25 O
to O
end O
the O
war O
. O

The O
Arab O
world O
had O
experienced O
humiliation O
in O
the O
lopsided O
rout O
of O
the O
Egyptian–Syrian–Jordanian O
alliance O
in O
the O
Six-Day O
War O
but O
felt B-change_sentiment
psychologically O
vindicated O
by O
early O
successes O
in O
this O
conflict O
. O

The O
war O
led B-causation
Israel O
to O
recognize O
that O
, O
despite O
impressive O
operational O
and O
tactical O
achievements O
on O
the O
battlefield O
, O
there O
was O
no O
guarantee O
that O
they O
would O
always O
dominate B-control
the O
Arab O
states O
militarily O
, O
as O
they O
had O
consistently O
through O
the O
earlier O
1948 O
Arab–Israeli O
War O
, O
the O
Suez O
Crisis O
, O
and O
the O
Six-Day O
War O
. O

These O
changes O
paved B-influence
the O
way O
for O
the O
subsequent O
peace O
process O
. O

The O
1978 O
Camp O
David O
Accords O
that O
followed O
led B-causation
to I-causation
the O
return O
of O
the O
Sinai O
to O
Egypt O
and O
normalized B-change
relations—the O
first O
peaceful O
recognition O
of O
Israel O
by O
an O
Arab O
country O
. O

Egypt O
continued O
its O
drift O
away O
from O
the O
Soviet O
Union O
and O
eventually O
left B-departing
the O
Soviet O
sphere O
of O
influence O
entirely O
. O

The O
Charge O
of O
the O

was O
a O

involving B-cause_to_be_included
the O
British O

by O

1854 O
in O

a O
task O
for O
which O
the O
light O

were O
well-suited O
. O

However O
, O
there O
was O
miscommunication O
in O
the O
chain O
of O
command B-control
, O
and O
the O
Light O
Brigade O
was O
instead O
sent B-sending
on O
a O
frontal O
assault O
against O
a O
different O
artillery O
battery O
, O
one O
well-prepared O
with O
excellent O
fields O
of O

. O

The O
Light O

reached B-arriving

under O

fire O
and O
scattered B-dispersal
some O
of O
the O

, O

they O
were O
forced O
to O
retreat B-escaping

and O
the O

ended B-process_end

Such O
a O
decision O
was O
ill-timed O

because O

The O

The O

Furthermore O
, O
the O
policy O

thus O

The O
objective B-aiming

The O
offensive O
was O
prompted B-causation
by O
the O
capture B-conquering

The O
outcome O
later O
caused B-causation
speculation O
that O
it O
was O
the O
result O
of O
a O

between O
